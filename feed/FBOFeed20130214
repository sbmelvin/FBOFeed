However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.

<SOLNBR>L13PS00207
<RESPDATE>031213
<ARCHDATE>04112013
<CONTACT>Danny Lavergne
<DESC>L13PS00207, FEEDING OF WILD HORSES AT THE PALOMINO VALLEY CENTER at Sparks Nevada, FOR A 12-MONTH PERIOD, WITH FOUR 12-MONTH OPTIONS.  Solicitation number L13PS00207 applies and will be issued on or about February 19, 2013 as a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the following requirement. As excess wild horses and burros are gathered in Nevada they are transported to PVC.  The objective of this contract is to procure services for the daily feeding of wild horses and burros awaiting preparation and disposition through the adoption program.  This facility is a permanent facility that holds animals temporarily, with a varying number of animals held throughout the year.(a)   The Contractor shall provide sufficient personnel to assure the daily feeding of up to 2,000 animals during the peak times (August through March) and as few as 50 animals during the slack times (April through June).  The total facility is capable of holding up to 2,000 animals at one time.  The Contractor shall arrive between 7 and 8 A.M. daily and provide feeding of wild horses and burros 365 days per year.  On most days, work should be completed within 7 hours. (b)   The facility consists of 10 outside pens and 36 smaller inside pens.  The outside pens are used to maintain the majority of the animals and can hold an average of 200 animals per pen.  These pens have large movable hay mangers.  The inside pens are used to segregate horses that have just been unloaded from gathers, for loads being shipped out, sick and/or injured animals as well as horses with special needs (i.e. to separate studs, mares, mares with foals and young horses).  These smaller pens have permanent hay mangers.  Occasionally, the Contracting Officers Representative (COR) or Project Inspector (PI) may direct the Contractor to place hay on the ground. (c)   It is anticipated that the feeding services for the wild horses and burros will require at least two contract personnel on a daily basis.  Since this facility does not have an automated feeding system, one of the Contractor's employees shall drive the BLM furnished truck and tractor, and the other Contractor employee shall break up the square bales of hay and place them by hand into the hay mangers. (d)   The safety and well-being of the Contractor's personnel performing these feeding services shall be the sole responsibility of the Contractor.  The behavior/conduct of the Contractor's personnel shall be the full responsibility of the Contractor. (1)	The Contractor shall be held accountable for any employee's misconduct, negligence, and/or failure to perform.  The Contractor's personnel shall have a working knowledge of feeding large numbers of animals in a feedlot environment. (2)	In the event that any one or more contractor personnel are observed performing the required duties in an unsafe manner to the animals, themselves, Government personnel, or endangering the Government Furnished equipment/supplies, the contractor shall be so notified by the COR or PI and the contractor shall provide an immediate replacement person at the facility within two hours of being notified. (e)   In as much as the facility is open to the public, the Contractor's employees will perform their duties in a manner that will not bring discredit on the BLM or the contractor.  Further, operation of equipment will take into consideration that members of the public may be in the area and utmost caution will be taken. (f)   The Contractor and personnel are responsible for any malicious damage or accidental damage of the Government furnished equipment.  On a daily basis, prior to operating any item of equipment, the contractor's personnel will perform an inspection of the vehicles/equipment. Vehicle defects identified by the contractor or operator during safety inspections shall be immediately reported to the COR or PI.  Repairs for accidental or malicious damage from Contractor use shall be paid for by the contractor.  The contractor shall maintain a daily log for each vehicle showing the inspection results and provide same to the COR upon request. (g)   The Contractor and personnel are also to be cautious of hitting standing feeders in outside pens.  Damage to feeders results in bending legs and damaging the feed truck and trailer.    (a)   The Contractor shall feed the animals the quantity of hay necessary to satisfy the animal's nutritional needs.  The hay required for adult horses is 25 pounds daily and for adult burros is 12 pounds daily.   (b)   The objective is for all animals to attain and/or maintain a good fleshy condition.  Fleshy condition is described as: back level; ribs, not visually distinguishable; wither, rounded; shoulders and neck, blending smoothly into body.  If this objective is not being met, a change in feeding will be directed by the PI, and/or the COR. (c)   In order to assure that all animals are able to maintain a good fleshy condition, the Contractor shall space the feed in the feeders/mangers so that all the animals are afforded equal access to the feed.  After feeding pens, watch for hay falling outside the pen, along fence line and in alleys.  It is the responsibility of the contractor to pick up this hay falling outside pens, along fence lines and in alley ways. (d)   In the event that the Contractor notices any animals in distress (i.e. sickly; injured; mares with foaling problems; or deceased animals; etc.), the contractor shall immediately notify a BLM representative of the problems so that appropriate action may be taken.  The Contractor shall also notify a BLM representative of any water trough malfunction, but not turn off any tanks due to malfunction. (e)   The Contractor shall feed all animals in accordance with the requirements set forth above, at least once per day, every day, to include Saturdays, Sundays, and all holidays.  Feeding shall be conducted within the hours of 7 a.m. to 4 p.m.  All duties are performed out-of-doors and subject to a wide variety of climatic conditions from below 0 degrees in the winter to over 100 degrees in the summer. (f)   The Contractor's personnel shall have the ability to drive/operate equipment such as diesel tractor with front-end loader, tractor-trailers, dump trucks, hay squeeze and forklift to perform such tasks as loading/transporting bales of hay through corral system to feed animals.  The contractor shall provide the BLM a list of personnel that will be operating the equipment.  The Contractor's personnel that will be operating the government furnished equipment shall have passed a proficiency test prior to being authorized to use such equipment. (g)   At the end of feeding each day, the contractor will inspect for rocks wedged between dual tires on trucks and trailers to prevent damage to tires. (h)   Once per week the contractor needs to wash mud from towing vehicles windshields, tires and undercarriage.  During periods when the corrals are extremely wet and muddy, feeding equipment needs to be washed daily to avoid buildup of debris that can cause damage to the feeding equipment. (i)   The Contractor's personnel will be required to exert extensive strenuous physical activity in an outdoor environment, such as lifting bales of hay weighing approximately 100 to 130 pounds; operating heavy equipment; standing and bending for long periods as well as walking/working in outdoor corrals. (j)   The Contractor shall furnish his personnel with the following equipment: hay chaps, protective clothing, gloves, pitch forks, hay hooks, pliers, wire and twine cutting devices. (a)   BLM will provide all the hay and supplemental feed which will be fed at the facility.  BLM will provide equipment necessary to perform these feeding services (see paragraph 7.0 for the complete Government Furnished Equipment list. (b)   Every morning the Contractor shall check in with the BLM PI and/or the COR for the current count of animals at the facility.  BLM representatives will also provide the following information to the Contractor: (1)	Type and amount of hay (grass hay, grass/alfalfa mix, and alfalfa hay) to go to each pen. (2)	The identity of pens that contain animals that day and the number of animals in each pen.  Identify pens that horses will be moved into due to sorting and gathers. (c)   If necessary (e.g. when unexpected loads of animals arrive from gathers, when horses are sorted into different pens that were designated that morning, when animals require more feed than was fed, etc.) the Government reserves the right to feed the animals at the facility.  Contractor shall check with the PI or COR before leaving to see if there are any changes.
(d)   BLM will provide for the maintenance and upkeep of the equipment used by the Contractor for use in feeding the horses and burros at the facility.  The Contractor should notify the PI or COR of any observed equipment problems that need attention.  The Contractor needs only to provide an adequate number of its employees to perform the feeding services on a daily basis.    This is not a complete list of the specifications and should be used only as a basis to decide whether or not to review the solicitation.

The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 811310 and the small business size standard is $7,000,000.00. This acquisition is a small business set aside. It is anticipated the solicitation will be issued electronically on or about 19 February 2013 on the Federal Business opportunities (FBO) web page at http://www.fbo.gov. Due date for receipt of proposal will be indicated in the solicitation document when it is released. Once the solicitation is posted on FedBizOpps, it is incumbent upon the interested parties to review this site frequently for any updates or amendments. It should be noted that paper copies of documents will not be provided. Offerors must be registered with the System for Award Management (SAM) or may not be considered for award. Registration can be accomplished at https://www.sam.gov. As of 1 January 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires the use of Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as part of the proposal submission process.

<p>The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsive responsible offeror whose offer will be most advantageous to the Government, with technical capability and past performance approximately equal to price. This acquisition will use FAR Parts 12 and 13 procedures and the following evaluation criteria will be used to evaluate proposals:</p>
<p>a. Technical Capability<br />b. Past Performance<br />c. Price</p>
<p>5352.201-9101 OMBUDSMAN (April 2010)<br />(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the USAF Academy Ombudsmen: <br />Kelly Snyder<br />5226 Cedar Drive<br />USAFA, CO 80840<br />Telephone number 719-333-2074<br />FAX 719-333-9075<br />email: kelly.snyder@us.af.mil</p>

<p>(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.</p>
<p>(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer. <br />(End of clause)</p>

<DESC>In accordance with Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (AMS) Policy 3.2.1.2.1 - this announcement is to conduct a Market Survey for the purpose of soliciting statements of interest and capabilities from interested vendors and acquiring a Rough-Order-Magnitude (ROM) of lifecycle price/cost for acquiring a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) solution for Configuration Management Automation (CMA).

This Market Survey announcement is a follow on to the CMA Market Survey/Request for Information (RFI), issued March 29, 2010.  This Market Survey builds upon and further refines this previous market research effort by elaborating on the requirements of the desired solution.  The FAA may use the information provided from this Market Survey as the basis for requests for one-on-one discussions or vendor solution demonstration.

The nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA will evaluate the responses to this Market Survey and will make further acquisition decisions based on those responses. The FAA envisions establishing a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract with Labor Hour (LH) components with a vendor determined to be both responsible and responsive to the needs of the FAA.  A FFP/LH contract provides for payment of hardware/software and the labor to install and integrate the solution, to the extent prescribed. 

At this time the nature of the final competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.  Small business participation is highly encouraged.  

The FAA anticipates a SIR will be issued during February 2014.  This Market Survey conveys the potential agency need and seeks sources capable of providing the desired functional capabilities described herein and associated pricing/cost information. Responses will assist the FAA in further developing the acquisition strategy for CMA.  All information provided in response to this Market Survey may be subject to release under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).  Information considered proprietary or confidential must be clearly marked as such.  Any information not identified as proprietary or confidential will be used at the FAAs discretion and may be publicly released without further FOIA disclosure review by the FAA or respondent(s).

PURPOSE:
The primary goals of this Market Survey are to: 

1.	Identify available enterprise level solutions in the market place that could meet the FAAs requirements for CMA;

2.	Provide information for the FAA to consider in choosing the method and type of procurement competition;

3.	Obtain vendor pricing/cost information for the full lifecycle of the CMA solution. Pricing/cost information should include various options and pricing/cost structures available;
 
4.	Identify potential technical approaches for the development of a solution which will meet the CMA requirements; 

5.	Provide information for the FAA to consider in choosing the method and type of procurement competition.  The failure to obtain adequate and appropriate SBA 8(a) or other small business participation may result in a determination to conduct this procurement under other competitive procedures;

6.	Obtain industry insight regarding acquisition, implementation, and support strategies for CMA; and

7.	Obtain additional industry insight regarding other CMA solutions and benefits not currently captured in the requirements.

STATEMENT OF NEED:
The FAA has a requirement for a new CMA solution.  The current FAA Configuration Management (CM) legacy systems, Web Change Management (WebCM) and Replacement Document and Configuration Identification (RepCON), do not effectively and efficiently incorporate evolving changes within the Agency due to a lack of flexibility and scalability. WebCM was implemented in 2005 for managing proposed changes to Configuration Items (CI)s in the National Airspace System (NAS) environment.  RepCON is an in-house developed tool designed to provide automated CM support, collect NAS configuration data and associated status, and maintain the as-is NAS configuration. These two existing CM systems do not provide a true full lifecycle management solution, since both systems are primarily utilized during the in-service management phase. The lack of an automated, flexible CM solution, has limited the efficiency and effectiveness of an enterprise-level CM solution. The current CM architecture modifications needed are both costly and time-consuming, while functional capabilities needed to meet operational goals are not feasible.

CMA will provide an automated, integrated enterprise solution to support CM of NAS and Non-NAS Information Technology (IT) assets and investments, encompass and expand the functionality and data of legacy CM tools, and make available a single point of access providing insight and traceability to the configuration baselines reflected in the FAA Enterprise Architecture (EA). 

CMA will be comprised of functional capabilities for CM, Business Process Management (BPM), data and content management, lifecycle management, with a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) platform for interfacing with other Non-NAS IT systems.

CMA will provide the additional required CM capability and will result in   enhanced safety, information security, cost control, data accessibility, product supportability, process improvement, and performance metrics. The acquisition of a CMA solution will allow for a flexible, robust solution that has the capability to incorporate necessary changes for today and as the Agency continues to transition to Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). 

CMA CAPABILITIES REQUIRED:
	Full Lifecycle Traceability: CMA will interface with key CM-related Agency systems to provide a closed-loop CM environment with full lifecycle traceability as defined in the AMS, i.e., during mission analysis, investment analysis, solution implementation and in-service management. 

	Real-Time Information: CMA will enable the capability for all CM Stakeholders to access real-time, accurate, site-specific CM information when it is needed, including essential information from other primary data sources.  This will be accomplished via interfaces to other Agency systems and enterprise toolsets.

	Manage the Growing and Increasingly Complex CM-Related Data:  CMA will focus on meeting needs to address the Agencys escalating challenges in managing the growing and increasingly complex amount of data required throughout the AMS program lifecycle; thereby enabling compliance to Agency CM and Acquisition policies.  

	Seamless Integration: CMA will incorporate seamless integration with other related processes and information, allowing the Agency to effectively manage established and future business rules.  This will support moving the Agency to a scalable, network-centric architecture that will ensure that everyone using CMA has easy access to the same information at the same time.  CMA will make available a single point of access providing insight and traceability of configuration baselines to the as-is and the to-be views reflected in the FAA EA. 

	Effective and Efficient CM Processes: CMA will facilitate the development of loosely coupled processes across the FAA to plan and manage the transition from current capabilities to NextGen.  Loosely coupled processes and workflows will provide the foundation for future process improvement efforts, resulting in Agency advancements in CM flexibility and scalability.

	Integrate and Automate Processes and Tools: The FAA Destination 2025 vision identifies safety, a skilled and dedicated workforce, innovation, sustainability and global collaboration as being top priorities for the Agency.  CMA will enable decision makers and stakeholders to effectively manage assets using current, accurate and easily accessible CM data, enabling effective portfolio management.

BENEFITS:
	Cost Savings:  CMA will encompass the existing functionality of RepCON, WebCM, and other legacy CM tools used by the Agency Lines of Business, thereby reducing the cost related to the legacy systems sustainment activities. CMA will also provide many opportunities for cost avoidance associated with timely, decision-making and efficient data accessibility and availability. 

	Policy Adherence:  The Agencys CM Policy, FAA Order 1800.66, prescribes that CM shall apply to all systems, subsystems and components of the NAS and Non-NAS IT.  CMA will provide an automated, integrated enterprise solution to support the Agencys CM of all segments of the FAA EA. The current legacy systems are primarily utilized during in-service management; however, CMA will provide a true lifecycle management solution to include all phases of systems and programs lifecycle as defined in the AMS.  The proper application of CM at an enterprise-level and throughout the lifecycle will support the Agencys ongoing mission to successfully transition to the NextGen. 

ASSUMPTIONS:
	The CMA solution shall be flexible and scalable allowing the FAA to easily adapt to future CM demands.

	Current technology shall provide more functionality at a lower cost than the Agencys legacy systems.

	The CMA solution shall improve the performance of time-consuming manual operations by providing increased agility for automated CM processes and tools.

	The CMA solution shall improve the efficiency and effectiveness of current automated operations.

	The CMA solution shall allow establishment of process improvement initiatives and industry best practices.

	The CMA solution shall be a non-proprietary system.

The CMA solution shall contain these capabilities and be provided by an industry standard CM COTS solution.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for a continued lease of two Zayo Group (formerly FiberGate Inc) provided, managed and maintained pairs of SMF-28 optical fiber between UMCP, College Park MD and GSFC, Greenbelt MD. Particular features of the service-provided fibers are a maximum intermediate reach 10db optical power loss fiber length, i.e. about 10 miles, carrying up to 100Gbps in each of up to 44 ITU - compliant channels, and demarc in specific buildings at both UMCP and GSFC. NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items from Zayo Group. Using prior research as a reference point, it appears to NASA/GSFC that only Zayo Group has the necessary rights of way licenses from the State of Maryland, Prince George's County, and I-295 US Park Services to deploy fibers in a pathway crossing I-295 that could meet NASA/GSFC's requirements. Therefore, NASA/GSFC believes that Zayo Group is the only company capable of doing this work. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on March, 1, 2013.

<DESC><strong>Contracting Office Address</strong><br />Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 6120 Executive Boulevard, EPS Suite 600, Room 6068, Rockville, MD 20852, UNITED STATES.<br /><br /><strong>Description</strong><br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI) plans to procure on a sole source basis with Nikon Instruments Inc; 1300 Walt Whitman Rd, Melville, NY 11747 for a custom designed Eclipse TiE inverted research microscope.
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1).</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>It has been determined that there is no opportunity to acquire green products or services under this contract.</p>
<p>NCI is investigating the cell biology of chromosome segregation in human cells and frog embryos. In order to investigate these processes, high-resolution and high-sensitivity microscopy is a routine and necessary part of our research program. The unique, custom-designed inverted microscope described here will be used by all laboratory members to image different cell types under multiple conditions and is essential to the goals of the laboratory.</p>
<p>NCI needs an Eclipse Ti-E inverted research microscope from Nikon Instruments Inc. Some of the distinguishing features of the Ti pertinent to the work the Kelly lab aims to perform are as follows:<br /><br />1. Expansion of infinity space with stratum structure design allows a second optical tier to be incorporated into the body of the microscope under the stage and nosepiece. In the current configuration, this space will incorporate a high-speed filterwheel for high-speed emission filtering to all (three) camera ports and the eyepiece port. Nikon was the first company to introduce this unique design, which allows for unmatched flexibility in experiment setup and allows the user to maximize the efficiency and usability of the system.<br /><br />2. Perfect Focus nosepiece eliminated focus drift, which makes it possible to perform long timelapse experiments or image specimens that are subjected to changes in temperature, which normally induce axial drift through expansion and contraction of the stage insert. A gold standard in the field of biological imaging, the PFS nosepiece corrects for Z drift 30 times per second and is only available from Nikon Instruments.<br /><br />3.

<DESC>This is a Synopsis Notice for Base Operating Support Services at U.S. Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.


The procuring contracting office is NAVFAC Southeast, Bldg. 903, P.O. Box 30, Naval Air Station Jacksonville, FL  32212. The point of contact is Rebecca Jones, Contract Specialist, (904) 542-8816; or Susan Smallwood, Contract Specialist, (904) 542-8815.


The solicitation number has changed (since the sources sought notice) from N69450-12-R-7590 to N69450-13-R-7999.


The proposed contract type is a combination Firm Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (FFP/IDIQ) contract.  It will be competitively procured using the policies and procedures of FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation.
  The contract term is anticipated to be a base period of one-year and four one-year option periods, for a total contract performance period not to exceed five years.  The FFP base year requirement will be the overall minimum guarantee.  If the Government does not award a follow-on contract in time, the Government may require the Contractor to continue performance for an additional period up to six months under FAR 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services clause.     


The primary NAICS Code for this procurement is 561210 and the annual small business size standard is $35.5M dollars. 


This acquisition is for Base Operating Support (BOS) services at U.S. Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.  All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.
 Pending approval, this contract will replace two contracts, N62470-06-D-4611, awarded in 2006 for similar BOS services, and N69450-12-D-7580, awarded in 2012 for similar Utilities BOS services.  Information about the current contract(s) and the incumbent contractor(s) (e.g., value of last option exercised, firm name, address, etc.) will be included in the solicitation package.  Requests under the Freedom of Information Act are not required for this information.


The work will include all labor, supervision, management, and materials, except that specified as Government furnished, to effectively perform BOS services (including Utilities BOS services) at U.S. Naval Station Guantanamo Bay.  The BOS services include the following functions: Family Housing, Facility Investment, Custodial, Pest Control, Integrated Solid Waste Management, Grounds Maintenance, and Transportation.
  In addition, the Utilities BOS services include the following functions:  Electrical, Wastewater, Water, Other (Swimming Pools), and limited Facilities Support functions.  In the event the request to consolidate these two contracts is denied, the Government will only solicit BOS services similar to those under contract N62470-06-D-4611.  This requirement is performance based.  


It is anticipated that the Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued on an unrestricted basis.    

The solicitation utilizes source selection procedures which require offerors to submit a technical proposal, past performance and experience information, and a price proposal for evaluation by the Government.


***NOTE: The Government intends to release one DRAFT solicitation of this procurement on or about 28 February 2013.
  This DRAFT solicitation will include two separate draft specifications; (1) for BOS services and (2) for Utilities BOS services.  These specifications will remain separate for DRAFT solicitation purposes.  Pending approval, the Government intends to either consolidate the two specifications into the final RFP or solicit for similar services as stated under contract N62470-06-D-4611.  There will be a comment period for potential offerors to submit questions related to the DRAFT solicitation.  Reference the Cover Page of the DRAFT solicitation for instructions on submitting comments/questions.  Following the comment period, comments will be reviewed and discussed at an industry forum scheduled in May 2013.
  More information regarding this industry forum will be forthcoming in a special notice.


Offerors can view and/or download the draft and final solicitations at https://www.neco.navy.mil/ when they become available. The anticipated date of final RFP issuance is on or about 17 June 2013.

<DESC>NAVSEA will utilize other than full and open competition to award a class of contract actions to Lockheed Martin Mission Systems and Sensors (LM MS2) in Moorestown, New Jersey (NJ) for the procurement and integration of two (2) Aegis Weapon Systems (AWS) in support of DDG 116 and the Aegis Ashore Missile Defense System (AAMDS) Host Nation #1 (HN-1), and associated engineering services in support of production efforts.

The anticipated contract actions will provide for delivery of two (2) AWS equipment sets, one each for DDG 116 and AAMDS HN-1.  The AWS shipset for DDG 116 will include production of selected equipment and integration and system-level testing of the AWS at the Moorestown, NJ Production Test Center (PTC).
  The AAMDS HN-1 equipment set includes the production of selected equipment and cabinet and sub-assembly level testing of the equipment.  Once this testing is complete, LM MS2 will deliver the HN-1 equipment set to MDA as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE).  LM MS2 will be responsible for production and fabrication of the AN/SPY-1D(V) arrays (4 per shipset), including an integrated Multi-Mission Signal Processor (MMSP), Aegis AMOD Upgrade equipment (AAU), and Combat System Support Equipment (CSSE) for each equipment set.  LM MS2 will also be responsible for integrating the DDG 116 Fire Control System MK 99, including the MK 82 Directors and MK 200 Director Controls, and the AN/SPY-1D(V) Transmitter Group delivered under separate contracts into the AWS and performing full functional testing of the complete AWS at the PTC.
  Once AWS system level testing at PTC is complete, the DDG 116 AWS equipment set will be delivered to the shipyard for installation into the ship.  LM MS2 will also be responsible for system engineering and technical services in support of the manufacturing process and ship integration, industrial level testing, and sea trials.

LM MS2 is the only responsible source capable of satisfying the Navys  requirements for delivery of a complete, fully functionally tested AWS shipset for DDG 116 and AAMDS HN-1 including production of the AN/SPY-1D(V) arrays, MMSP, AAU and CSSE.   LM MS2 possesses unique experience in AWS design, development, production, assembly, and testing, and currently provides the necessary services to deliver an integrated and tested AWS to the fleet.
  LM MS2 also provides installation material, ancillary equipment, provisioning items, administrative data, technical data, and provisioning technical data.  As such, LM MS2 understands the system functionality and detailed specifications in order to produce systems that satisfy the AWS requirements and are compatible with existing components and infrastructure of the entire Aegis Combat System (ACS), of which the AWS is one component.  All previous AWS production contracts for shipsets and AAMDS equipment have been awarded on a sole-source basis to LM MS2 (or its antecedents).     Under these contracts, LM MS2 has developed an extensive infrastructure at its Moorestown, NJ facility to support AWS production.
  This infrastructure (production facilities, qualified supplier base, special test equipment, data networks, system test environments, producibility engineering workstations, etc.) also supports the separate LM MS2 contractual responsibilities for Aegis development, FMS AWS production, U.S. Navy and FMS in-service engineering, and other depot operations.  Because this infrastructure supports other ongoing contractual responsibilities, the Navy could not transfer it to another contractor for performance of these requirements.  LM MS2 is the only existing source with the in-depth technical expertise, knowledge, resources, and infrastructure to produce, integrate, and test the AWS without adverse impact to deliveries in support of the USN shipbuilding schedule and ship deployment requirements for operational use, and the Aegis Ashore programs initial operational capability (IOC) date of 31 December 2015.

For the reasons stated above, pursuant to 10 U.S.C.
 2304(c)(1), NAVSEA intends to award a contract for the production, integration, testing and engineering support services for production, integration and test of the Aegis Weapon System (AWS) for DDG 116 and HN-1 to Lockheed Martin Mission Systems & Sensors (LM MS2) in Moorestown, NJ. Parties interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact LM MS2 directly.

Notice: The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.
 However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Please review the above description and all comments and questions should be submitted in writing electronically to Ms. Jennifer L. Thompson, Contracting Officer, via email at jennifer.l.thompson1@navy.mil in lieu of telephone calls.
  Do not phone in any questions or comments, they will not be considered.

<DESC>NAVSEA will utilize other than full and open competition to award a class of contract actions to Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems in Tewksbury, Massachusetts for the production of two (2) AN/SPY-1D(V) Transmitter Groups and two (2) Fire Control System (FCS) MK 99 equipment sets in support of DDG 116 and the Aegis Ashore Missile Defense System (AAMDS) Host Nation #1 (HN-1) and associated engineering and technical services in support of production efforts.   

The anticipated contract actions will provide for delivery of two (2) of the AN/SPY-1D(V) Radar Transmitter Group and FCS MK 99 Mod 14 equipment sets for DDG 116 and AAMDS HN-1.  Raytheon IDS will also be responsible for related technical services to facilitate system testing, shipyard installation, and other requirements.
  The Transmitter Group consists of Radio Frequency (RF) driver and amplification cabinets, an RF monitoring cabinet, high voltage power supplies, and isotransformers. The transmitter group provides high power RF energy for use by the radar to support its primary function of target detection and tracking.  The transmitter group also supports the generation of the missile data link for communication with missiles while in flight.  The FCS equipment set consists of Continuous Wave Illuminator (CWI) elements, waveguide elements between the transmitter and antenna, and the data conversion cabinet.  The FCS CWI elements provide high power, stable RF energy to support semi-active missiles in the terminal phase of flight.
  After production, the Transmitter Group and FCS MK 99 DDG 116 shipset will be shipped to the Production Test Center (PTC) for integration with the remainder of the AWS and system level testing by Lockheed Martin Mission Systems and Sensors (LM MS2).  The HN-1 equipment set will be delivered to the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) for deckhouse integration and system level testing.    

Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Raytheon IDS is the only responsible source capable of satisfying the Navys and Missile Defense Agencys (MDA) requirements for the AN/SPY-1D(V) Radar Transmitter Group, FCS MK 99, and related technical services.  Raytheon IDS is the current and only qualified source as the manufacturer, assembler, and design agent for the AN/SPY-1D(V) Radar Transmitter Group and FCS MK 99.
  The company is responsible for completing Aegis Ashore Missile Defense Test Complex (AAMDTC) equipment at the Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF) and all AWS new construction requirements related to this equipment for those DDGs still within the SCN window (DDG 107 and DDG 109 through 115) and related back-fit requirements for CG/DDG Class ships.  Raytheon also develops configuration modifications which serve as the foundation for all forward fit changes or upgrades to new construction DDGs and the AAMDS.  Raytheon has been the prime production contractor for the AN/SPY-1 Transmitter Group since the first contract was awarded for the AWS effort in 1969.  As the design agent for the FCS MK 99, Raytheon has also been the principal subcontractor to LM MS2 for past transmitter and FCS modification developments.
 Under separate contracts, Raytheon IDS is developing transmitter group and FCS upgrades for the Aegis AMOD Upgrade (AAU) program and Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) baseline 4.0.1, all of which will be part of DDG 116 and HN-1 AWS configurations.  Raytheon IDS is the only existing source that has the specific production engineering background, extensive integration and test facilities, prior FCS MK 99 and AN/SPY-1D(V) transmitter group experience, and in-depth technical expertise to produce the equipment without adverse impact to scheduled AWS deliveries in support of the USN shipbuilding, and ship deployment requirements for operational use, and the Aegis Ashore programs Initial Operational Capability (IOC).
  

For the reasons stated above, pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), NAVSEA intends to award a contract for the production, integration, testing and engineering support services for the AN/SPY-1D(V) Radar Transmitter Group and MK99 Missile Fire Control System (MFCS) for DDG 116 and HN-1 to Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems (IDS) in Tewksbury, MA. Parties interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Raytheon directly.

These slightly modified Commercial Off- the-Shelf (COTS) items and software support are being requisitioned in support of the LCS Multi-Vehicle Communication System (MVCS).
 These items are manufactured by The Parvus Corporation,  3222 S Washington St, Salt Lake City, UT, 84115-3426.

Currently, no other source meets the certification requirements for interoperability with the MVCS.  The slightly modified COTS items being purchased were specifically tested, evaluated, and certified as part of the MVCS. Other slightly modified COTS items would require extensive engineering testing and certification which would result in the required deliverable dates not being achieved.
 Currently, no other source meets the certification requirements for interoperability with the MVCS.

<DESC>**PLEASE NOTE: THIS IS A PRESOLICITATION NOTICE. ALL INTERESTED OFFERORS MUST COMPLETE AND RETURN A RESTRICTED ACCESS REQUEST IN ORDER TO BE GRANTED ACCESS TO THIS REQUIREMENT **
<p>The United States Department of State (DOS) has a requirement for a qualified Contractor to provide local guard services at the U.S. Embassy Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago. The Embassy requires a secure environment to conduct their mission. The Contractor shall provide the organizational structure, management, and qualified staff at levels adequate to meet or exceed the requirement contained in the Performance Work Statement (PWS). The Contractor shall be required to provide services in a manner that prevents loss or injury to U.S. personnel, dependents, property; destruction of assets; prevents unauthorized access; and deters potential terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of State intends to award a time and materials contract, with firm-fixed price and cost reimbursable elements, for local guard services on behalf of the U.S. Embassy Port of Spain. The Government will solicit this requirement as a full and open competition using the acquisition procedures outlined in FAR Part 15. The Government plans to award one contract as a result of this acquisition.</p>
<p>Anticipated period of performance is one base year and four one-year options, which shall be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government. The estimated number of annual hours for guard services at this location is 140,000 hours.</p>
<p>All contracted personnel, regardless of nationality, will be required to pass a background investigation conducted by the Contractor and a separate background investigation conducted by the U.S. Government to certify their suitability to work under this contract.

All dates are subject to change, and any change will be posted on FedBizOps.</p>
<p>A site visit will be scheduled within twenty (20) days of solicitation release. The date of the site visit will be in Section L.1 of the solicitation when released. All interested parties must register in order to be granted access to the U.S. Embassy Port of Spain. Offerors are responsible for all travel arrangements, visas, local transportation, and accommodations in Trinidad and Tobago. Due to space limitations, only two (2) representatives from each firm will be allowed for the site visit. Offerors are requested to provide notice of their interest in the solicitation (i.e., name of representative, name of firm, address) to Kelli Parker at parkerkm@state.gov, if interested in attending the site visit. PHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.</p>
<p>The Question and Answer (Q&amp;A) period opens with the posting of the solicitation and ends on the date specified in Section L.9 of the solicitation. The solicitation, when finalized, will be available on the Internet at www.fedbizopps.gov.</p>

<p>All proposals from responsible vendors will be evaluated if received on time. All prospective offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to be eligible for award. In accordance with 22 U.S.C. &sect; 4864, the Government will give preference to offerors qualifying as U.S. persons or U.S. Joint Venture Persons.

<a href="mailto:dennis.putman@va.gov">Network Contracting Office (NCO) 15</a>
<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Administration, Network Contracting Office (NCO15), Leavenworth, KS, intends to solicit proposals from contractors in the NCO15 area which includes the States of Kansas, Missouri, a portion of Southern Illinois, and small sections of Indiana and Kentucky in the Tri-State area (see map:  http://www.visn15.va.gov/v15/sites_cboc_map.asp) to provide Adult Day Health Care services at contractor's facilities under Basic Ordering Agreements.  

The VA anticipates issuing an open-continuous solicitation for this requirement on or about February 28, 2013. Proposals will be accepted throughout the one-year period commencing with the issuance date of the solicitation. The solicitation will be available for download from http://www.fbo.gov.  Interested contractors will be responsible for downloading copies of the solicitation (and any subsequent amendments) from that website, and no hard copies will be made available.  The solicitation will provide full information to contractors about the proposal submission process.  Prospective offerors are encouraged to register their interest in the solicitation on the FBO website so that they are notified of the issuance of the solicitation and any amendments.  Proposals will be downloaded and evaluated for award on a periodic basis beginning within 30 days after issuance of the solicitation.  

In accordance with FAR  52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration, VetBiz Registration, prospective contractors must be registered in System for Award Management (SAM) and in VetBiz databases under the applicable NAICS.  Firms may obtain SAM information at https://www.sam.gov  and Vet Biz information at http://www.vip.vetbiz.gov.  To be eligible for award, contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management database at https://www.sam.gov.  Registration is free and potential offerors are encouraged to visit the SAM  website and register as soon as possible to avoid delays so they may be considered for a contract award. 

NAICS Code is 624120 (Services for the Elderly and Persons with Disabilities) with a small business size standard of $10.0M.  The solicitation will be issued for full and open competition.  Multiple awards are anticipated and will be made on an as needed basis. All responsible sources may submit proposals which may be considered by the Agency. 

The VA will only consider proposals from contractors who are licensed by their respective States and who are Medicare/Medicaid qualified.

Awards to responsive and responsible offerors will be made on the basis of best value to the Government using the following criteria:

"	Assessment of need with consideration of relevant veteran population in specific areas and number of existing Agreements already serving those areas.
"	Distance of contract facility from area of consideration
"	Number of available beds
"	Medicare overall rating score (2-star and above is VA standard)
"	Current State License
"	Prospective Contractor must have current registration in System For Award Management (SAM).
"	Prospective Contractor must have a current professional liability policy in the amount of $1,000,000 prior to award.
"	Prospective Contractor must submit a completed VA Form 10-1170, "Application for Furnishing Long-Term Care", prior to consideration for award.
"	Prospective Contractor must pass a VA inspection (fire safety, general safety, and compliance inspection conducted by VA personnel) prior to award.

Placements will be made in contract facilities based on availability of facilities and the desires of the veterans and their respective families.  Because it is impossible to determine actual usage of any particular contract facility, the VA uses Basic Ordering Agreements with no guaranteed minimums.  However, based on a typical usage rate of 1 veteran for 365 days, a reasonable estimate for the value of any particular contract would be around $50,000 per year, with many facilities experiencing authorized veteran populations in excess of 15 per year.  Daily rates differ depending on case mix and location.  

Questions concerning this announcement should be directed to the Contract Specialist using the e-mail link provided.  No hard copies of the solicitation will be provided.  Telephone requests for information or questions will NOT be accepted.  Please email requests or questions to dennis.putman@va.gov  and ensure that the subject line includes: solicitation # VA255-13-R-0498 and reference the site location if applicable.

However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NHLBI shall arise as a result of a response to this Sources Sought notice or the NHLBI's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.</p>
<p>The NHLBI is seeking capability statements from all eligible small business concerns [particularly Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB), Woman-owned Small Businesses (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Small Businesses, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (VOSB) and Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB)] under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541990 with a size standard $14.0M.</p>
<p>Based on the responses received from this SOURCES SOUGHT announcement, the proposed acquisition may be solicited as a Total Small Business Set-Aside. All eligible small business concerns responding to this Sources Sought Announcement must have the capabilities to provide the services as stated below.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The Molecular Physiology and Therapeutics Branch (MPTB), Division of Intramural Research (DIR), National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR), has a need for the services of an expert who can perform rheumatological assessment of rodent models of autoimmune disease as well as novel technology to follow changes in gene expression. This expertise is necessary in order to expand upon the current studies in patients suffering from Sjogren's Syndrome.</p>
<p>Contractor Requirements:</p>
<p>In this study, NIDCR plans to identify any salivary gland abnormalities that may predispose to salivary gland dysfunction in Sjogren's Syndrome (SS) patients. To explore if the striking female predominance of SS can be explained by intrinsic differences in salivary glands, NIDCR will compare the gene expression profiles in patients and develop rapid transgenic animal models of these conditions  to assess their effect on expression. This approach may identify abnormalities that are important in the chronic inflammatory process (normal looking cells vs. cells from infiltrate) and the loss of epithelial function. These studies are covered under protocols 84-D-0056, 94-D-0018, and 99-0-0070.</p>
<p>The work to be performed  is directly  related  to the mission.  The specific tasks to be performed are as follows:  prepare and analyze samples from Sjogren's patients using microarray technology.  The contractor shall have in-depth knowledge and understanding of rheumatology and Sjogren's Syndrome.</p>
<p>Government Responsibilities:</p>
<p>Not applicable</p>
<p>Reporting Requirements and Deliverables:</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide monthly itemized invoices to NIDCR.  Research data, including results obtained through the process, as well as other relevant data, will be collected and maintained on a daily basis in the laboratory on-site in Building 10, NIDCR.  A completed final summary must be submitted within thirty (30) days after the base year.</p>
<p>Inspection and Acceptance Requirements:</p>
<p>Not applicable</p>
<p>Period of Performance</p>
<p>The proposed period of performance will be twelve (12) months from date of contract award with the potential for one (1) option year.</p>
<p>Interested qualified small business organizations should submit a tailored capability statement for this requirement, not to exceed 10 single-sided pages (including all attachments, resumes, charts, etc.) presented in single-space and using a 12-point font size minimum, that clearly details the ability to perform the aspects of the notice described above and in the draft SOW. All proprietary information should be marked as such. Statements should also include an indication of current certified small business status; this indication should be clearly marked on the first page of your capability statement (preferably placed under the eligible small business concern's name and address).  Responses will be reviewed only by NIH personnel and will be held in a confidential manner.</p>
<p>All capability Statements sent in response to this SOURCES SOUGHT notice must be submitted electronically (via email) to Jonathan Lear, Contract Specialist, at learj@nhlbi.nih.gov in either MS Word or Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF), by February 22, 2013 12:00PM, EST. All responses must be received by the specified due date and time in order to be considered.</p>

<DESC>Pearl Harbor MSMO for FFG/DDG/CG Class Ships
Solicitation: TBD
Agency: Department of the Navy
Office: Naval Sea Systems Command
This is a sources sought announcement in anticipation of a potential future procurement program. The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) is conducting market research to determine industry capability and interest in performing maintenance, repair, and alterations of FFG 7, DDG 51 and CG 47 class ships homeported in and visiting Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The Government seeks responses from any source interested in performing the aforementioned work beginning at contract award (anticipated in early calendar year 2013) and continuing for a period of performance of 5 years.
 Non-docking availabilities will be at Naval Station Pearl Harbor and docking availabilities will be at the Naval Station Pearl Harbor Dry Dock.
As part of its market research, the Government is interested in determining under what circumstances potential sources that currently dont have a significant presence within of the Pearl Harbor, Hawaii homeport area could be interested in competing for the MSMO contract for FFG/DDG/CG Class Ships in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii?
NAVSEA intends to procure execution planning, ship repair, modernization, and inter-availability maintenance (continuous and emergent maintenance) of FFG 7, DDG 51 and CG 47 class ships in the homeport of Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, utilizing Multi-Ship Multi-Option (MSMO) contracting.
 MSMO contracts target efficient and effective maintenance practices by allowing the executing agency the ability to better plan its work and take advantage of best repair capabilities. They provide long-term vendor relationships throughout ships' training/ deployment/ maintenance/ modernization cycles. In order to reduce costs through the benefits of advanced planning, MSMO contracts allow the contractor to respond to continuous and emergent maintenance requirements on short notice, and as the contractor is intimately involved with both the planning and execution, less time is spent evaluating prospective jobs. The MSMO contractor can also respond on short notice to voyage repairs required on deployed ships, giving the Navy the option of using the homeport-based contractors vice a foreign source, if needed.
 MSMO contracts cover repair and overhaul requirements for an entire ship class, or classes, and are awarded to a prime contractor for a base year, plus several option years. The MSMO contract provides continuity for planning and maintenance processes for Navy ships and the private sector teams awarded the work.
Interested companies should submit, on company letterhead, a notice of interest including the name, telephone number, mailing address, and e-mail address of one point of contact to Commander, Naval Sea Systems Command, Attn: Morgan Reese, Code SEA 02441. Please submit your letter of interest electronically via e-mail to morgan.reese@navy.mil with Pearl Harbor Future MSMO Sources Sought Response in the subject field.
 The notice of interest should include a brief description of your company and its capabilities as they relate to the requirements set forth on this announcement, and answers to the following specific questions. Please limit your response to no more than 15 pages. 
1.	Is your company classified as a small or large business as defined by the Small Business Administration and according to the size threshold associated with NAICS code 336611? How many employees does your company have?
2.	Does your company have a website? If so, what is your companys website address? 
3.	Given the complexity of the work described in this notice, does your company plan to submit a proposal in response to the anticipated solicitation for maintenance, repair, and alterations of FFG 7, DDG 51 and CG 47 class ships homeported in and visiting Pearl Harbor, Hawaii?
4.	Given the complexity of the work described in this notice, are there any constraints that could be mitigated by the Navy that, if mitigated would entice your company to submit a proposal in response to the anticipated solicitation for maintenance, repair, and alterations of FFG 7, DDG 51 and CG 47 class ships home-ported in and visiting Pearl Harbor, Hawaii?
5.	What are the circumstances that could, in your opinion, be mitigated?

Contractors that are required to have their own EVMS shall follow procedures contained in the VA EVMS Application Guide. 

2.  The following paragraphs reflect EVMS requirements and may be modified as necessary for selected use. [Choose one of the subparagraph a's below.] 

a. Integrated Contractor Services.  This contract requires that contractors providing direct support services to VA staff will be required to participate in the VA EVMS and submit timesheets.  Contractor personnel integrated into VA Staff and providing direct support in the completion of VA project tasks as part of the Government Earned Value Management System must provide assigned task planning, executing, controlling, and closing information to government project management staff.  Gathering this information would include having individual contractor resources enter their planned and actual work time against their assigned activities into the government project tracking/timesheet application.  The contractor shall be responsible for ensuring all work information is correct. 

 Or-

a. Contractor Independent Deliverables.  This contract requires the contractor to operate as a distinct entity to produce a deliverable(s).  The contractor is required to have its own compliant EVMS, per VA Directive 6061, Table B-1, and provide EVM reports to the VA. 

(1). Non-Compliant EVMS.  If the offeror proposes to use a system that has not been determined to be in compliance with the American National Standards Institute /Electronics Industries Alliance (ANSI/EIA) Standard-748, Earned Value Management Systems, the offeror shall submit a comprehensive plan for compliance with these EVMS standards. Offerors shall not be eliminated from consideration for contract award because they do not have an EVMS that complies with these standards. 

(2). EVMS Reports.  As a minimum, contracting officers shall require contractors to submit EVMS monthly reports for those contracts for which an EVMS applies. 

(3). Subcontractors.  EVMS requirements will be applied to subcontractors using the same rules as applied to the prime contractor.  VA will decide the flow down of the EVM requirement to subcontractors. In all cases, the prime contractor is responsible for reporting EVM data.

(4). EVMS Plan.  When an offeror is required to provide an EVMS plan as part of its proposal, the contracting officer will determine the adequacy of the proposed EVMS plan prior to contract award. 

(5). Performance Measurement Baseline.  Contractors are required to resource load schedules in order to set a performance measurement baseline.  Resources do not have to be specifically named.

(6). Program Management Reviews.  The Contractor shall conduct Program Management Review (PMR) meetings at mutually agreed upon dates and locations.  During these reviews, the contractor shall present integrated cost, schedule, and technical performance status.  Government Integrated Product Team (IPT) leads or functional managers shall include cost information in discussions of schedule status, technical performance, and risk using earned value as an integrating tool.  The following shall be addressed: Cost/schedule trends, significant cost/schedule/technical variances, projected impacts, quantified risk assessments, and corrective action plans. 

(7). Contractor Earned Value Management.  The Cost Performance Report Description (VA-DI-MGMT-81466A), and Integrated Master Schedule Description (VA-DI-MGMT-81650) shall be developed, maintained, updated/statuses and reported on a monthly basis per deliverable requirements, respectively.  The contractor shall establish, maintain, and use in the performance of this contract, an integrated management system compliant with the Industry Guidelines for Earned Value Management Systems (EVMS) ANSI/EIA-748 as determined by the Government. 

An EVMS that has been formally validated and accepted by the cognizant contracting officer is required for all (fixed price, cost, or incentive) contracts, subcontracts, and other agreements valued at or greater than $50 million in then-year dollars.  The application of these concepts shall provide for early indicators of contract cost and schedule problems.

For contracts valued at or greater than $20 million but less than $50 million then-year dollars, the following statement applies:  The contractor is required to have an Earned Value Management System that complies with ANSI/EIA-748; however, the government will not formally validate/accept the contractor's management system (no formal review).  The contractor will submit an EVMS description and proof of prior certification with its bid.

(8). Integrated Baseline Review (IBR).  The contractor shall review its performance measurement baseline plan with the Government within six months of contract award or initiation of an Undefinitized Contract Action, and subsequently, when required, following major changes to the baseline.  The Government will verify during the IBR, and follow-on IBRs when required that the contractor has established and maintains a reliable performance measurement baseline.  The contractor will ensure that the baseline includes the entire contract technical scope of work consistent with contract schedule requirements, and has adequate resources assigned.  The contractor will assure the Government that effective earned value methodologies are used to accurately measure work accomplished and determine contract cost, schedule, and technical performance.  The IBR will be used to achieve a mutual understanding of the baseline plan, cost and schedule risk, and the underlying management processes used for planning and controlling the project. 

(9). Subcontract Cost/Schedule Management and Reporting.  Subcontracts exceeding $20M in then-year dollars will apply the requirements of the Integrated Master Schedule Description (VA-DI-MGMT-81650) and the Cost Performance Report Description (VA-DI-MGMT-81466).  For contracts valued at or greater than $20 million but less than $50 million, the following statement applies:  The contractor is required to have an Earned Value Management System that complies with ANSI/EIA-748; however, the Government will not formally validate/accept the contractor's management system (no formal review).  EVMS flow down to contracts of less than $20M in then-year dollars or Firm Fixed Price contracts that exceed 12 months duration is a risk-based decision and will be as mutually agreed between the contractor and the Government. 

(10). Contract Work Breakdown Structure (CWBS).  The contractor shall develop and maintain the CWBS and CWBS dictionary.  

(11). over Target Baseline (OTB)/Restructure.  The contractor may conclude the baseline no longer represents a realistic plan in terms of budget/schedule execution.  In the event the contractor determines an OTB/Restructuring action is necessary, the contractor must obtain Government approval prior to implementing an OTB/Restructuring action.  The request should also include detailed implementation procedures as well as an implementation timeframe.  The contractor will not implement the OTB/Restructuring prior to receiving written approval from the Contracting Officer. 

(12). Award Fee Criteria.  For contracts that include an award fee, the contractor will demonstrate the use of Earned Value Management (EVM) as a tool for cost and schedule control and as a basis for communicating with the Government.  The Government will determine the eligibility for of and amount of any award fee granted. In addition to demonstrating the use of EVM award fee criteria for the contractor will include the following:

(a). Maintain timely detail planning as far in advance as practical; 

(b). Ensure the system provides accurate cost/schedule performance status, reliable and timely cost/schedule projections, and quantified risk assessments;  

 (c). Provide clear and comprehensive explanations of performance problems and associated impacts, and establish and carry out effective recovery plans; 

 (d). Control and minimize changes to the baseline particularly in the near term;  

 (e). Ensure all subcontractor-authorized effort is detail planned into measurable objective work packages to the extent possible; 

 (f). Provide program-level Estimate at Completion (EAC) assessments that include consideration of potential risks and cost containment plans; and   

(g). Demonstrate responsiveness regarding management system and cost/schedule performance questions and issues/concerns raised by the Government.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT-WIRELESS PERSONAL QUANTIFICATION DEVICE
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is ONLY to invite qualified socio-economic firms to submit capability statements demonstrating the ability to provide the supplies listed below. To be included in the capability statement, firms shall include information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUB Zone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>The objective of this purchase order is to acquire a wireless personal quantification device that will be used in Federal Occupational Health's Fedstrive and other health promotion programs. These devises will be managed by the FOH staff. They will be checked out to participants for a period of time and then returned to the FOH staff. The devise will be used as a tool to improve the health of the participants.</p>
<p>The personal quantification device shall automatically synchronize with a user's personal computer or smartphone to capture daily performance metrics and chart their progress over time. This fitness device shall be an engagement platform for facilitated tracking of individual performance that does not require the manual capture of data through hand-written logging and/or hand-typed entry into a web-based system associated with a conventional pedometer. The acquisition shall be for a commercial off-the-shelf wellness promotion product that tracks and displays metrics linked to physical activity and caloric expenditure on the device using an integrated display or external display such as a smartphone or wristwatch for instantaneous feedback. It may also include an activity score or other info-graphic that conveys the degree of activity or progress toward a defined goal level (e.g. total caloric burn, distance traveled, etc). Quantifying relevant personal metrics and automating the capture of data using a personal computer or smartphone will empower users to track and evaluate their progress toward individual health goals, while avoiding cumbersome manual data logging approaches. Reducing this barrier to participation shall increase adherence to physical activity and nutrition regimens recommended by health promotion staff. Specific requirements are detailed below:<br />&bull; The device shall possess the ability to wirelessly deposit physical activity related data onto a user's personal computer or smartphone device. This may be accomplished by using an adaptor attached to the receiving device or using integrated wireless data transfer standards that leverage the receiving device's existing hardware (e.g. Bluetooth, ANT+, or Wi-Fi).<br />&bull; At a minimum the device shall be able to capture steps through an accelerometer or equivalent technology. In addition, the device shall be able to measure the intensity of each step to determine the relative caloric expenditure (i.e. caloric burn of walking versus running).<br />&bull; The device shall be durable enough to endure the rigors of repeated use during periods of physical activity, including but not limited to, sweat or other moisture and basic impact shock resistance.<br />&bull; The device may capture additional metrics including, but not limited to, staircases climbed, sleep efficiency, pulse, blood oxygenation level, heart rate, or quantify other types of physical activity in addition to steps depending on the device's inherent capabilities.</p>

<DESC>Dugway will execute a free enterprise test week (4 nights of testing) during the week of July 29, 2013.  Participants from private and government are invited to participate as independent teams and will bring their equipment and operators to DPG at their own expense. Participants will document their understanding that their systems and data collected will be kept proprietary.  Optionally, participants who include Dugway in their data evaluation will gain access to ground truth data for the event releases.  A day of setup and pretest as well for retrograde will be included in the schedule.  Dugway will provide power and basic communication resources on the test grid.  Additionally, life support resources such as latrine, water, and shelter from exposure will be made available for the operators.  On release days, Dugway will conduct multiple releases of standard bio-simulant. Dissemination methods will be determined, in part, from a pre-survey submitted by participants.  Referee and ground truth data of the releases will be collected by DPG using an instrumentation array standard to current acquisition testing methods.  Examples of instrumentation to be used will include particle size distribution, viability, via point and stand-off units such as APS, UVAPS, LIDAR, STA, and AGI.  The participants who opt to reveal data captured during the release events will be supplied a limited data set from the employed referee systems defining the cloud developed by the release as presented to their systems under evaluation.  Dugway will not make any evaluations of participant equipment or collected data.

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Columbia-Cascades Area Office, Yakima River Basin Water Enhancement Program (YRBWEP) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Yakima Tieton Irrigation District (YTID) for a firm-fixed price to conduct an assessment to evaluate alternatives to upgrade their main canal and provide reliable irrigation water delivery to Cowiche Creek water users. The assessment will be used by YRBWEP to complete a Tributaries Report outlining implementation alternatives for improving instream flows and restoration of fish habitat in the Cowiche Creek Basin. This assessment includes: developing base maps, identify main canal replace alternatives, identify main canal evaluation criteria,  develop Cowiche Creek expansion alternative, field investigations, stakeholder workshop, and project  management. The proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1 (b). Basis for intent: Since 2001, the Cowiche Creek Restoration Project has been in various stages of planning and implementation by the North Yakima Conservation District, Reclamation, the State of Washington, YTID, the Yakama Nation, and other Cowiche Creek stakeholders. YTID has already met with landowners, water rights holders, and other stakeholders in the Cowiche Creek watershed, and has formed a stakeholder group consisting of Washington State agencies, Federal agencies including YRBWEP, the Yakama Nation, and Cowiche Creek water users. In an effort to improve habitat in Cowiche Creek YTID has entered into an agreement with the Cowiche Creek Water Users Association (CCWUA) to deliver 8 cfs of irrigation water from the Tieton River in exchange for the CCWUA placing their creek rights in trust for instream flows and removing two Cowiche Creek diversion dams. YTID is the only entity with the capability of providing an alternate source of irrigation water to the Cowiche Creek Basin. Firms believing they can provide the service required must provide written notification to the Contracting Officer with supporting evidence to that effect in sufficient detail to demonstrate the respondent's ability to meet the stated requirements. This notice is not a request for competitive quotations and award of this requirement will not be delayed to qualify a new contractor. 
Responses should include the firm's Dun and Bradstreet number (DUNS) and Tax Identification Number (TIN). Prospective contractors MUST be actively registered in the SAM database to be eligible for award. Firms should identify business size (i.e. small business, other than small business, etc.). This notice may represent the only official notice of such a solicitation. Responses and questions concerning this solicitation should be directed to Connie Morgan by e-mail to cmorgan@usbr.gov no later than February 25, 2013.

<DESC>On February 14, 2012, the President signed the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (FMRA) into law.  The FMRA includes requirements for integrating unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) into the national airspace system (NAS), including direction for the FAA to establish a program to integrate unmanned aircraft systems into the national airspace system at six (6) test ranges.

In March 2012, in an effort to solicit and capture the public perspective and opinion on the UAS Test Ranges (Sites), the FAA began an outreach campaign.  The FAA posted a Request for Comment (RFC) in the Federal Register [Docket No. FAA-2012-0252] regarding the six Test Sites, and in April 2012, the FAA hosted two public webinars to facilitate direct public interaction.  This outreach effort assisted FAA in developing the strategy for designating the sites.

The first formal step in designating the sites is the issuance of a Screening Information Request (SIR).  The SIR, referred to in other Government agencies as a Request for Proposal, or RFP, is the vehicle through which the FAA will request interested parties (Applicants) to submit specific information for evaluation.  This SIR (and any future changes, if any) will be available on the FAA Contract Opportunities Web Site (http://faaco.faa.gov).  Additional information about the SIR process including the time critical schedule (Table 1) should be reviewed immediately by Applicants.  One parameter of note is that all Test Site Operators (the awardees) MUST BE NON-FEDERAL PUBLIC ENTITIES.

The FAAs common acquisition process for obtaining information, evaluating interested parties, and selecting successful Applicants is contained in the agencys Acquisition Management System (AMS). The FAA will use the AMS as guidance in the SIR process for obtaining and evaluating information.  The ultimate designation of the six Test Sites will be by Order of the Administrator.

Applicants who have been selected by the Administrator will enter into individual Other Transaction Agreements (OTAs) with the FAA.  Each OTA will set out the terms and conditions under which the respective entity will operate the UAS Test Site.

Prior to release of the SIR, privacy concerns were raised with regard to integrating UAS into the NAS.  In order to address these concerns, the FAA is continuing to engage in outreach efforts to the public and interested parties for their perspectives.  The SIR contains a draft OTA with the privacy-related requirements and recommendations (policy) reserved.  The FAA will solicit perspectives from the public and interested parties on this proposed privacy language in a RFC process which will run concurrent with the SIR response process.  The RFC posting will follow the SIR release by a few days.  The RFC language will be made available at http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/uas/.

The final privacy requirements that are developed from this RFC process will address privacy-related data collection by Test Site operators and vehicles.  Test Site operators will be required to establish a privacy policy that is public, and builds confidence and trust.  Furthermore, the FAA expects that the information gathered about UAS operations at the Test Sites will contribute to the dialogue among privacy advocates, policymakers and the industry about how to address broader questions relative to the technologies used.

The FAA values all input regarding the proposed privacy language to be later inserted in the OTAs.  Although the SIR is posted on (http://faaco.faa.gov), comments regarding the proposed privacy policy should be made directly on http://www.regulations.gov [Docket No.:  FAA-2013-0061].  The FAA will post all comments it receives on regulations.gov, without change.  In addition, the FAA is planning a public outreach event to discuss the parallel privacy policy development process.  The event schedule will be posted to http://www.regulations.gov.

The final FAA-developed privacy policy, with specific language and requirements, which incorporates public comments, will be included in the OTA and provided prior to selection.  The final privacy policy, language, and requirements will also be made available on www.regulations.gov.

FAA Administrator Michael Huerta discusses the economic significance of Unmanned Aircraft Systems on the US economy in the attached letter.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY: This request for information is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bid, Request for Proposal, Solicitation, and Request for Quote, or an indication that the Government will contract for the items in this RFI. The Government does not intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this request. The Government does not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this RFI. Any responses received will not be considered nor used as a proposal.<br />The Department of Homeland Security, Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) is conducting market research for the purpose of identifying possible sources and the availability of a Commercial off the shelf Learning Management System (LMS) as well as the administration&nbsp;and mangement of this system.&nbsp;The FLETC is seeking a cost effective solution to enhance and expand its delivery of quality law enforcement training by partnering with an organization capable of professionally administering, managing and providing support for an (LMS) used to deliver law enforcement training content in support of the FLETC Online Campus Program.<br />The FLETC Online Campus vision is conceived as a secure online law enforcement learning environment that seamlessly complements and extends FLETC classroom training, as well as offering general training to a law enforcement-wide audience. Properly vetted and authenticated law enforcement officers (including federal, state, local, tribal, territorial, and campus officers) and support personnel, FLETC students and staff members, and approved FLETC Partner Organizations (PO) members will have the opportunity to securely access law enforcement training materials and courses online, anytime-anywhere, to enhance their own personal and professional development.<br />The planned partnership would have FLETC continue to develop compliant, consistent and branded law enforcement training content for online delivery; while the successful partner would administer and manage a FLETC approved Online Training Delivery Governance using the organizations approved LMS that meets Federal and DHS Security Requirements. The LMS should be capable of supporting at least 300 FLETC Level 3 online lessons/training materials, and providing and supporting delivery of online training to approved subscribers ranging in number from 10,000 to 250,000 or more over the life of the partnership. Additionally, the LMS requirements would include an average availability of 95% or greater.<br />The FLETC requests the following information from potential sources:<br />&bull; Company name, Duns number, street address and point of contact with phone number and email address.<br />&bull; Provide a brief capability statement (not to exceed 10 pages excluding brochures, pamphlets, catalogs and website information) that individually addresses the requirements stated in the attached requirements&nbsp;document. The source must also include in their capability statement any certification statement on&nbsp;their ability to meet Federal standards for the protection and monitoring of information systems and the secure delivery of content.<br />&bull; What is your socioeconomic status? (see attached small business definition sheet)<br />&bull; Do you currently have contracts with other government agencies (to include federal, state and local) to provide access to, and to manage and administer a secure LMS? If so, please provide the Agency name and point of contact information and contract number if possible.<br />&bull; Do you have a current GSA contract for managing a LMS? If so, please provide the GSA schedule number and the SIC codes that apply to these systems.<br />&bull; Please provide publically available price lists.
<p>This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes. There is no guarantee that the Government will pursue a solicitation for any of the requirements identified in the future. All information received in response to this RFI will NOT BE RETURNED. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.</p>
<p>All information should be directed to Mr. Douglas Marshall via email: douglas.marshall1@dhs.gov or by facsimile to (912) 267-3132. Questions or requested clarifications regarding this Request for Information must be submitted no later than February 21, 2013 at 3:00 PM eastern standard time.<br />&emsp;<br />FLETC Level 3 Online Lessons/Training Content involves interactions that are more complex than information models (compared to categories/levels 1 and 2 CBT), and allows the user an increased level of control over the lesson scenario through peripherals such as light pen, touch screen, track ball, or mouse. Video, graphics, or a combination of both is presented simulating the operation of a system, subsystem, or equipment to the user. The lesson scenario training material typically is complex and involves more frequent use of peripherals to affect a transfer of learning. Operation and maintenance procedures are normally practiced with category/level 3 scenarios and students may be required to alternate between multiple screens to keep pace with the lesson material. Multiple software branches (two to three levels) and rapid response are provided to support remediation. Emulations and simulations (constrained models) are an integral part of this presentation; however these are not full free play simulations. This may also include complex developed graphics, and/or clip art, and provided video and audio clips.</p>

<p>This is a notice of intent made in full compliance with FAR 8.402 (f) to add open market items to a General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) task order.</p>
<p>The United States Coast Guard (USCG), Aviation Logistics Center (ALC), Short Range Recovery (SRR) Division intends to award a task order for open market items in conjunction with FSS services received in response to GSA e-Buy Request for Quotation (RFQ) number 760875 to meet the needs of the agency. The requirement has been adequately solicited and competed under FAR Part 8.405-2.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Task Order is to provide structural repair support services to assist in Program Depot Maintenance (PDM) of sheet metal and composite structures on the H-65 aircraft. An RFQ was posted to GSA on 05 February 2013 and quotes were received on 08 February 2013.</p>
<p>Offerors were instructed to provide hourly rates and overtime rates for all key personnel. During evaluations, it was determined that overtime rates were not covered by GSA FSS task orders. The overtime rates for the resultant task order will be awarded as open market services to the successful offeror. This is considered administratively convenient to the USCG and the open market services will be subject to the terms and conditions of Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 12.</p>

<p><br />CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT</p>
<p>52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS</p>
<p>(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-</p>
<p>(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-</p>
<p>(A) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(B) Have ( ) have not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and</p>
<p>(C) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision.; and<br />(D) Have [ballot], have not [ballot], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(ii) The Offeror has ( ) has not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. <br />(2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).<br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. <br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. <br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <br />(End of provision)<br />52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.

Hard copies of this solicitation are not available. There are no technical drawings/bid sets available. This solicitation is not set-aside for small business. While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance. The required delivery is 90 days. One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the US by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979.

The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307</p>

As specified in Dr. Gioannini's VA grant proposal, determination of the nuclear magnetic resonance spectra and analyses of NMR data is a component of the pursuits to understanding the mechanisms of TLR4 activation.  As Dr. Gioannini's research has developed, it is becoming increasingly clear that NMR analyses of the reagents that her laboratory has developed would provide unique insight into interactions that occur with functionally viable reagents in a dynamic state.  This information would lend further insight into the mechanism of the role of TLR4 in innate immunity and add another dimension to the information that has been gleaned from X-ray crystallography.  The University of Iowa Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) facility will provide usage of the Avance 800 NMR instrument as well as expertise and analyses of data related to the sample materials as well as controls.  

Period of Performance is 4/1/2013 - 3/31/2014.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

It is the responsibility of the interested contractors to obtain copies of the necessary provisions and or clauses that are required as a part of this solicitation. Required clauses/provisions that are not submitted may render a quote not to be accepted by the Government. 

The following Clauses are applicable:


FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items; NOTE: This provision must be reviewed completely.
 It contains the guidelines for submission of your quotation.

FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation of Commercial Items; 

(a)  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Quoting Contractors  whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers.
    (i)  CAPABILITY TO PERFORM
    (ii)  PAST PERFORMANCE
   (iii)  PRICE

Quotes will be evaluated first under Factor (i) above, which represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.  Under this factor, quotes will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the quote to be technically unacceptable and to not be considered for award.
  See paragraph (b) below.

Only those quotes which meet the minimum requirements established by Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii) and (iii).  In the second step of evaluating those quotes determined under Factor (i) to be technically acceptable, Factor (ii), PAST PERFORMANCE, is equally important as Factor (iii), PRICE.  

At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with quoting contractors.  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the quoting contractors best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.   

(b)  By submitting a signed quote under this solicitation, Contractors assert that it is technically capable of performing the specification/statement of work and all aspects of this contract.
 The contracting officer will validate quoting contractors technical capability to perform by verifying that the quoting contractor has financial resources, organization and facilities required to perform the contract. TECHNICAL CAPABILITY TO PERFORM represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria. Under this factor, quotes will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable. Failure to be determined technically acceptable under this factor will render the quote to be unacceptable and to not be considered for award. 

(c)  Quoting Contractors PAST PERFORMANCE information submitted as required, will be used to make a determination of whether the quoting contractor has a satisfactory record of past performance.
  Quoting Contractors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to THREE prior similar contracts performed within the past three years. 

PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided on the forms provided as an attachment to this solicitation.  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources who may have relevant information. 

Quoting Contractors which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any quote which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other quotes.

The Contracting Officer will evaluate Quoting Contractors PAST PERFORMANCE as follows:

SATISFACTORY:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the quoting contractors past performance.

MARGINAL:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the quoting contractors past performance.

NEUTRAL:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.
  Quoting contractor has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor.

(e)  A written notice of award or acceptance of a quote mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful quoting contractor within the time for acceptance specified in the quote, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

<DESC><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is (202) 372-3695</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br /></p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor?s CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government?s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor?s CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

<DESC><p>Amendment 0007 to the Eglin AFB solicitation SPE600-12-R-0827 has been posted on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website and can be found at www.fbo.gov. The purpose of the amendment is to revise the cut-off date from February 19, 2013 at 4:00pm Eastern Standard Time to March 5, 2012 at 12:00pm Eastern Standard Time for the Receipt of Proposals. Please note: It is the responsibility of each offeror to review Amendment 0007 for all changes from the solicitation document.</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE: To access the secured documents on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website, all vendors must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) first and foremost. If you are not registered in CCR, you will need to register in SAM. The System for Award Management (SAM) is a Federal Government owned and operated free web site that consolidates the capabilities found in the old CCR/Federal Agency Registry (FedReg), the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA), and the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS) websites. All records from CCR/FedReg, ORCA, and EPLS, active or expired, were moved to the SAM website. If you have a registered account in CCR, you can utilize your CCR user name and password in SAM, but only after creating a SAM account. Keep in mind that it takes 48-72 hours for the registration process in SAM to be complete. The SAM website is located at https://sam.gov/.</p>
<p>If you are registered in CCR, once you click on the secured document link in the FBO, it should prompt you with the corresponding link for the DD2345 - Military Critical Technical Data Agreement Form, in order to complete the Joint Certification Program (JCP) certification. All vendors are required to fill out and submit the DD2345 form. Instructions for submission of that form can be found in that link as well. DLA Energy has been advised that it has been taking 2-3 months for JCP certification to be complete.</p>
<p>UPDATED INFORMATION REGARDING JCP: DLA Energy will no longer accommodate those vendors that have not received certification through JCP by providing information via DVD/CD with the submission of the DD2345, effective January 16, 2013.

<DESC><p>The Defense Logistics Agency Energy (DLA Energy) has posted additional documents to the Technical Libraries for Grand Forks AFB and Cavalier AFS. The documents&nbsp;for Grand Forks AFB&nbsp;can be found in&nbsp;the secure package SPE600-13-9543 and the documents for Cavalier AFS can be found in the secure package&nbsp;SPE600-13-9544.<br /><br />PLEASE NOTE: To access the secured documents on the FBO website, all vendors must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) first and foremost. If you are not registered in CCR, you will need to register in SAM. The System for Award Management (SAM) is a Federal Government owned and operated free web site that consolidates the capabilities found in the old CCR/Federal Agency Registry (FedReg), the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA), and the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS) websites. All records from CCR/FedReg, ORCA, and EPLS, active or expired, were moved to the SAM website. If you have a registered account in CCR, you can utilize your CCR user name and password in SAM, but only after creating a SAM account. Keep in mind that it takes 48-72 hours for the registration process in SAM to be complete. The SAM website is located at https://sam.gov/.</p>
<p>If you are registered in CCR, once you click on the secured document link in the FBO, it should prompt you with the corresponding link for the DD2345 - Military Critical Technical Data Agreement Form, in order to complete the Joint Certification Program (JCP) certification. All vendors are required to fill out and submit the DD2345 form. Instructions for submission of that form can be found in that link as well. DLA Energy has been advised that it has been taking 2-3 months for JCP certification to be complete.</p>

Wherever the words "offer", "proposal", "offerors", or similar terms are used in this solicitation, they shall be read to mean "quote", "quotation", "quoter", ?vendor? or similar corresponding term to reflect that this solicitation is a Request for Quotations, not a Request for Proposals or an Invitation for Bids. <BR> <BR>Quotes must be submitted per unit price.

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-9131), US Coast Guard, Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 2100 2nd Street, SW, Stop 7112 , Washington, D. C. 20593 -7112.

<p><br />SECTION C - DESCRIPTION / SPECIFICATIONS / STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p><br />STATEMENT OF WORK<br />FOR<br />MILLING MACHINES AND TRAINING</p>
<p>C.1 INTRODUCTION <br />This requirement is for two vertical milling machines and associated training for the 22nd Maintenance Battalion, General Support Company, Support Plt, Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. The milling machines are required to repair the transmissions of Amphibious Assault Vehicles (AAV).</p>
<p>C.2 BACKGROUND <br />The Support Platoon is responsible to repair the AAV transmissions. The machine shop can repair the transmissions, in most cases, with the proper machine tools and software. The vertical milling machine is required to perform the complex machining repairs on the AAV transmissions. Such repairs cannot be completed in a convenient fashion without the Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) software. For the individual Marine to write the code required to perform the manufacture/repair of several different types of repair parts would take weeks. The CAM software will increase productivity by allowing the Marine machinist to set up and program the milling machine within a day.</p>
<p>C.3 SCOPE OF WORK <br />The increased capability that the milling machine would bring will provide the Marine machinist in the Intermediate Maintenance Activity the tools needed to maintain the advanced vehicle and weapon platforms the Marine Corps is moving towards. As the technological advancements in weapons, armor and transportation assets continues to keep our fighting forces on the cutting edge, so too must our Machinists have the ability to program complex parts and maintain the tolerance required to produce, repair and fabricate the parts needed by the war fighters.</p>

<p><br />52.209-5 -- Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters.<br />As prescribed in 9.104-7(a), insert the following provision:<br />Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010)<br />(a)<br />(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --<br />(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals --<br />(A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and<br />(C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and<br />(D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(2) Examples.<br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159.

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--</p>
<p>(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p>(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>(1) [_] Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). <br />The offeror [_] does [_] does not certify that-</p>

<p>(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.</p>
<p>(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies-</p>

<p>(l) Taxpayer identification number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)</p>

Submitted proposals must reflect Technical, Past Performance, and Price as described in Section M. It is solely the Contractor's responsibility to ensure proposals are received within the required timeframe.</p>
<p><br />SECTION M - EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD</p>
<p><br />M.1 BASIS FOR AWARD. The Government intends to make award to the lowest priced, technically acceptable offeror that possesses a relevant, satisfactory performance record. In accordance with FAR Part 12.206 Past Performance will be evaluated. The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest priced, technically acceptable offeror when the offeror's past performance record demonstrates anything other than satisfactory performance.</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate proposals and select an offer based on the initial evaluation of proposals received in response to the solicitation. Therefore, offerors are cautioned that their initial proposals should contain their best terms from a technical and price standpoint.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 52.212-2, the evaluation criteria that will be used for/applied to all proposals received in response to this solicitation are: (1) Technical Capability, (2) Past Performance, and (3) Price.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a response which, if timely received, will be considered by the agency. All timely proposals will be evaluated and an award will be made without discussion with vendors, unless discussions are determined to be necessary.</p>
<p>M.1.1 FACTOR #1 - TECHNICAL. A mere statement that the vendor will meet the Government requirement is NOT sufficient. The proposal will be evaluated to determine if the offeror possesses the capability required to successfully perform the requirements of the solicitation. Proposals are evaluated for acceptability but not ranked using non-cost/price factors. Technical capability will be evaluated on contract requirements listed in Sections B and C of this solicitation (See Section L for instructions to offerors ).</p>
<p>Offers will be evaluated first on price. The lowest price offer will be evaluated for technical acceptability and satisfactory past performance. When an offer is determined to technically acceptable with satisfactory past performance, no further evaluations will be conducted and award will be made to that offeror.</p>
<p><br />M.1.2 FACTOR #2 - PAST PERFORMANCE. Offeror(s) shall submit information as indicated in Section L, Paragraph L.1.2 in this solicitation. Information provided in the proposal shall include similar contracts with Federal, State, and local governments, as well as commercial businesses. Similar contracts are defined as those similar in scope, magnitude, and complexity to this procurement.</p>
<p>M.1.2.1 Performance Evaluation. The Government will evaluate the offeror's, and (if applicable) its principal subcontractors' demonstrated past performance in delivering quality services and in meeting schedule requirements on similar programs. The performance risk assessment will address the probability of the offeror successfully accomplishing the contract requirements based on relevant past performance. The currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in contractor's performance will be considered. Problems not addressed by the offeror will be considered to still exist.</p>
<p>Each offeror will be evaluated to the extent to which they demonstrate satisfactory performance on contracts or subcontracts currently ongoing or completed within the last three (3) years. References other than those identified by the offeror may be contacted by the Government and used in evaluating the offeror's past performance. Past performance is an indicator of how current and/or previous customers assess contractor performance under a specific contract performed for them and address the full range of all functions required to make any contractual relationship work. Successful past performance indicates that a contractor understands and has the resources to successfully execute a contract; however, it does not necessarily mean a contractor has the resources and skills necessary to perform the specific work requirements of this solicitation.</p>
<p>Evaluation of past performance will be based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances. The evaluation will include demonstrated past performance in quality of product or service, schedule, business relations, and customer satisfaction. The following table identifies the adjectival ratings and descriptions utilized in rating past performance history:</p>
<p>ADJECTIVAL RATING DEFINITION<br />Satisfactory Performance MET contractual requirements. <br />Unsatisfactory Performance DID NOT MEET contractual requirements.</p>
<p>In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. Offerors without a record of relevant past performance will receive a "neutral" rating, that will have neither a positive nor negative effect. If there is no record of relevant past performance, offerors must affirmatively state this.</p>
<p>M.1.3 FACTOR #3 - PRICE. Offerors shall submit price/proposal as indicated in Section L, Paragraph L.1.3 in this solicitation. Award will be made on the basis of the lowest priced, technically acceptable offeror.</p>

<DESC>This requirement is based on a rapidly deployed pre-engineered modular substation using readily available pad-mount components including a fixed tap transformer and separate single phase regulators.  It is anticipated that such a design will result in lower costs and shorter lead times.     <br>      <br>   OBJECTIVES   <br>      <br>   The overall objective of this RFI is to improve the government's understanding of industry capabilities and identify qualified sources capable of providing these critical services in support of the purchase and installation of the electrical substation.  Fort Riley reserves the right to utilize information from the responses to this RFI to determine if any business may be applicable to any resultant solicitation.  Responding to this RFI does not automatically qualify the responder to be included on any list, if such a list is developed.  Vendors wishing to submit a response to any subsequent solicitation must monitor FedBizOpps for the synopsis.     <br>      <br>   This Request for Information is for information purposes only and shall not be construed as a commitment or a promise of a contract by the Government.  This is not a solicitation.  This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach, nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government.    <br>      <br>   CAPABILITIES COVERAGE-   <br>      <br>   Fort Riley seeks to identify vendors that can provide the following required work.  This project is to provide and install a complete and usable above ground outdoor substation, including connecting the substation to existing primary and secondary electrical distribution lines and commissioning of the completed system. The Contractor shall furnish all surveys, engineering, design, labor, equipment, materials, and transportation to perform all required work in accordance with this document:   <br>   SPECIFICATIONS:    <br>      <br>   The new substation capacity shall be at least 5,000 KVA.   <br>      <br>   The primary side of the substation shall be fed from the existing 34.5kV distribution line, located immediately northeast of the site.   <br>   The secondary side of the substation shall feed two circuits to the existing 12.47kV distribution line, also located immediately northeast of the site (under built to the 34.5kV).  The 12.47kV line shall be cut and two risers shall be installed so that one circuit will feed to the north, and the second circuit will feed to the south.   <br>   This requirement is based on a rapidly deployed pre-engineered modular substation using readily available pad-mount components including a fixed tap transformer and separate single phase regulators.  It is anticipated that such a design will result in lower costs and shorter lead times.     <br>   MODULAR SUBSTATION   <br>   Substation Type:  Distribution substation with numerous residential and commercial loads on two 12.47kV feeders serving up to 2,600kVA each    <br>   Substation shall be completely assembled, installed and tested.   <br>   Substation may be completely assembled in the factory and pre-tested prior to shipping and made ready for connection to incoming 34.5kV underground transmission, and outgoing 12.47 kV underground feeder conductors.   <br>   The substation and all components may be pre-assembled on galvanized steel skids, designed for installation on site-prepared concrete pier foundations; or, it may be assembled and installed on site on poured in place concrete pads.   <br>   Substation shall include power transformer, regulators, and secondary switchgear with vacuum circuit breakers, reclosing relays, current and voltage transformers, and all associated instrumentation and wiring.  Also provide galvanized steel supports, weatherproof enclosures, control building, mounting skids, anchor bolts, and any other equipment necessary for a complete and usable substation.   <br>   PRIMARY CONNECTIONS:   <br>   Recommended point of connection is the existing 34.5kV primary overhead line at pole E1645, located immediately to the east of Building 2620.  The existing 34.5kV line is three 477MCM ACSR overhead cables in a delta arrangement.   <br>   Pole E1645 shall be replaced with a new pole that is structurally able to support the new tie-in equipment.   <br>   The new pole E1645 shall include an overhead radial tap to the existing 34.5kV primary line and a new Gang Operated Air Break (GOAB) switch, lightning arrestors, hook stick fuses, shield wire terminations, and riser to transition to underground feed to the new substation.    <br>   Underground Distribution:   <br>   New underground cable shall be 35KV, MV-105, copper conductor, EPR insulated cable with tape shield.   <br>   Underground cables shall be installed in rigid steel conduit, or PVC conduit encased in concrete.   <br>   Above grade risers shall be installed in rigid steel conduit.  Transitions from rigid steel to PVC, if used, shall be made below grade.   <br>      <br>   Power Transformer:   <br>   Type:  Outdoor, Pad-Mounted, Deadfront    <br>   Capacity:  At least 5,000KVA at 55 C rise, no fans   <br>   (OPTION 1:  7,500KVA at 55 C rise, see section Error! Reference source not found.)   <br>   Number of Phases:  3   <br>   Primary Voltage:  34.5kV   <br>   Primary Connection:  Delta   <br>   Secondary Voltage:  12.47kV    <br>   Secondary Connection:  Grounded Wye   <br>   Frequency: 60 Hz   <br>   Taps:  None   <br>      <br>   Voltage Regulators:   <br>   Type:  Self Contained, Outdoor, Pad-Mounted, Dead Front, Single-Phase, Fluid-Immersed, Step-Type   <br>   Capacity:  At least 167KVA per phase, 500KVA total (10% regulation)   <br>   Quantity:  3   <br>   Voltage:  7.2kV nominal   <br>   Frequency:  60Hz   <br>   Regulation:  +/- 10% in 32 steps of 5/8%   <br>   Secondary Switchgear:   <br>   Type:  Outdoor, Fully Enclosed, Pad-Mounted, Three-Phase.     <br>   Number of Circuits:  One Main and Two Feeders   <br>   Interrupting Medium:  Vacuum   <br>   Continuous Current Rating:  600A   <br>   Interrupt Rating:  12kA   <br>   Protection Relays:     <br>   1.	Type:  Microprocessor based   <br>   2.	Protection shall include:   <br>   a.	Instantaneous/Time Phase Overcurrent (50/51)   <br>   b.	Instantaneous/Time Neutral Overcurrent (50/51N)    <br>   c.	Recloser (79), required on feeders only   <br>   d.	Under/Over voltage (27/59)    <br>   3.	Relays shall be fully configurable from the local display and keypad, without the need for a computer interface.   <br>   Main and feeder circuits shall be metered for voltage (V), current (A), demand (KW) and accumulated energy (KWH).    <br>      <br>   Remote Communications/Monitoring:  Meters and Relays shall include integral Modbus communications.  Communication cable shall be installed to connect all devices together to provide a single  quote mark point of connection quote mark .  This Modbus access point will not be connected to the post network at this time, but will facilitate a future connection to the network and the post Energy Management Control System.   <br>   SECONDARY CONNECTIONS:   <br>   Recommended point of connection is the existing 12.47kV overhead line at pole E1644, located approximately 200' to the southeast of Building 2620, and immediately northeast of the site.  The existing 12.47KV line is four #4 CU overhead cables in a grounded Wye arrangement.   <br>   Pole E1644 shall be replaced with a new pole that is structurally able to support the new tie-in equipment.   <br>   The existing 12.47 line shall be cut at pole E1644 and a new horizontal Gang Operated Air Break (GOAB) switch installed to allow the two sections to be tied together.  On each side of the tie switch, install overhead radial taps to two new hookstick operated switches, shield wire terminations, and riser to transition to underground feed from the new substation.  (Note:  Alternative proposals for the switching arrangement on this pole, including the use of vertical GOAB switches in lieu of the hookstick operated switches, or running the risers up two separate poles, will be considered.)   <br>   After completion, the standard configuration will be for the tie switch to be open and both riser switches to be closed.  In addition, at pole E1705A west of ESS05, the existing tie switch will be closed and the riser switches opened.

<DESC>This amendment will answer the following questions:<br /><br />1. Does the Library of Congress want a profile to prevent configuring WEP access on a device?
<p>2. Does this mean the Library of Congress wants to force devices to always use WPA2 for WiFi?</p>
<p>Answer to 1 &amp; 2: It is assumed that wireless access points are, by nature, insecure. Please explain how your solution utilizes an encryption method to secure these access points.</p>
<p>3. All wireless access points utilized for the LCWN must conform to the IEEE 802.11b and IEEE 802.11g wireless protocols</p>
<p>These are typically hardware specific requirements - can the Library of Congress please explain further what the intent of this requirement is?</p>

These hotspots may not be encrypted by default and could allow others to connect to the network with no password. Please explain how your solution addresses this potential vulnerability.</p>
<p>4. In order to provide a cost estimate we will need an estimated number of users that will require MDM. Could the Library of Congress please provide us with an estimate number of potential MDM users?</p>

<SOLNBR>DE-SOL-0005270
<NTYPE>SNOTE
<CONTACT>Pamela S. Thompson
<DESC>REQUEST FOR EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST FOR DOE PADUCAH GASEOUS DIFFUSION PLANT FACILITIESAND DOE DEPLETED AND OFF-SPECIFICATION UF6 INVENTORIES
NOTICE: PLEASE CHECK THE DOE PPPO WEBSITE DAILY FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS, ETC. http://www.pppo.energy.gov/Notices.html 
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is requesting expressions of interest (EOIs) from industry related to the following, either separately or in combination: ?	Lease or purchase of DOE Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PGDP) facilities or land near Paducah, Kentucky, either to continue the use of the facilities to enrich uranium, or separately for other nuclear fuel industry applications (e.g., analytical laboratory, uranium transfer and shipping facility) or to utilize individual facilities (e.g., buildings, warehouses, machine shops, utilities) for other commercial purposes. ?	Purchase, exchange, or transfer of various lots of uranium hexafluoride (UF6) inventories in standard and non-standard cylinders from the DOE PGDP and the DOE Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PORTS).  These inventories include large amounts of high-assay depleted UF6 (DUF6) and smaller amounts of slightly enriched and normal assay off-specification UF6.  All of these materials are free from any prior obligations.  In addition, DOE also has large amounts of low-assay DUF6 available.    This request for EOIs pertains only to the inventories of uranium identified in this EOI and no other DOE uranium inventories; for example, it does not pertain to DOE inventories of natural UF6 and is unrelated to the ongoing transfer of UF6 in exchange for cleanup work at PORTS. ?	Any combination of the above two bullets (e.g., use of a portion of the DUF6 in the enrichment operations at the PGDP). The intent of this request for EOIs is to identify opportunities to create value for the U.S. government while lowering overall program costs for surveillance and maintenance and/or disposal of uranium materials.  FOR FULL EXPRESSION OF INTEREST PACKAGE COMPLETE WITH ALL ATTACHMENTS GO TO http://www.pppo.energy.gov/Notices.html OVERVIEW OF PADUCAH GASEOUS DIFFUSION PLANT FACILITIES The United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC) currently leases the PGDP from DOE and operates the plant to enrich uranium.  It is expected that USEC will return essentially all of the PGDP facilities to DOE in the very near term.  When DOE accepts USEC?s return of the PGDP to DOE, the opportunity may exist for private industry to lease or purchase PDGP facilities or land, either to continue to enrich uranium and/or to utilize individual facilities (e.g., buildings, warehouses, machine shops, and utilities) for other commercial purposes.  The potential also exists for DOE to sell or transfer vacant land and/or personal property associated with PGDP facilities) for reuse/reindustrialization. The PGDP gaseous diffusion parallel cascade includes 1760 stages.  The parallel configuration allows the number of stages in series to shift as needed for production efficiency.  Through the use of different valve configurations, the plant is operated by USEC to enrich uranium up to assay s of about 5.5% 235U.  More detailed information about the PGDP is presented in Attachment 1. The PGDP is a large industrial site that may have radiological or chemical contamination within or around the perimeter of the facilities.  Facility contamination would need to be considered in planning for alternative uses at the site.  DOE is responsible for implementing the environmental cleanup program at PGDP under the Federal Facilities Agreement among DOE, the Commonwealth of Kentucky, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.  DOE is interested in uses for PGDP assets that would benefit the local Paducah economy.  DOE will also consider the implications of any company that operates PGDP as an enrichment facility on the DOE mission to support national nuclear security and on any safeguards and security requirements.  Interested firms should provide information indicating whether they are a wholly-owned U.S. corporation or would otherwise be able to satisfy the legal requi rements in a manner that would allow any enriched uranium resulting from enrichment at the PGDP to be available for national security purposes.  Detailed information on conditions, considerations, and submittal requirements for EOIs for the lease or purchase of PGDP facilities is presented in Attachment 2.  DOE has broad authority, including section 161g. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, to lease or sell real and personal property.  DOE looks to lease, sell or transfer the property in this EOI in a manner and at a value that is overall in the best interest of the government. OVERVIEW OF URANIUM HEXAFLUORIDE (UF6) INVENTORIES DOE has large inventories of UF6 located at the DOE PGDP and at the DOE PORTS site near Piketon, Ohio.  DOE has DUF6 Conversion Plants at both of these locations.  DOE has identified the opportunity to offer for sale, exchange, or transfer (1) high-assay DUF6 (i.e., DUF6 with 0.341% to 0.7% 235U or more), as well as (2) certain off-specification, slightly enriched UF6 (i.e., UF6 with an average assay of 1% 235U) and normal-assay uranium (i.e., previously processed uranium with 0.711% 235U).  Large amounts of low-assay (i.e., 0.15% to 0.34%) DUF6 are also available.  DOE is seeking detailed EOIs from parties interested in receiving as UF6 the high-assay DUF6, the off-specification UF6, the low-assay DUF6, or a combination of the categories.  DOE would comply with all applicable laws in conducting any transfer or sale of uranium, including section 3112(d) of the USEC Privatization Act for transfers or sales of material covered by that section.   Attachment 3 presents a summary  of the high-assay DUF6 cylinders at PGDP and PORTS that shows assay ranges and total metric tons of uranium (MTU).  The DUF6 is primarily contained in thin-walled 14 ton metal (48G) cylinders.  The majority of this DUF6 meets the equivalent of the ASTM specification for commercial UF6 feed material, ASTM C787 11 Standard Specification for Uranium Hexafluoride for Enrichment.  (There is no ASTM specification for DUF6.)  However, some of the DUF6 is known to contain trace contaminants as a result of historical processing in the gaseous diffusion plant cascades.  Attachment 3 also presents a summary of information for the off-specification slightly enriched and normal UF6 material.  Additional information on all of these uranium materials is available on request. Responses to this request for EOIs should propose potential commercial use of the uranium materials in order to assist DOE in evaluating as necessary any potential adverse material impacts on the domestic uranium market.  Detailed information on conditions, considerations, and submittal requirements for EOIs for the purchase, exchange, or transfer of uranium materials is presented in Attachment 4. DOE is also interested in receiving responses from firms interested in a combination of the PGDP facilities and the uranium materials (e.g., using the PGDP to re-enrich DUF6 material). CONDITIONS, CONSIDERATIONS, AND EOI SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PGDP FACILITIES CONDITIONS The following is a list of conditions that would have to be met in the EOI.  The inclusion of this list is not exclusive, but represents the significant conditions known at this time. a.	Any sale, exchange, or transfer must be in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. b.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.
<p>This notice is being published by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 5.201 AND 5.204 requiring notice of a proposed contract action. This is a notice of intent to extend the services provided under NIEHS Contract Number N01ES35504. This is NOT a request for competitive proposals. The statutory authority for this sole source action is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Inherent duplication of cost to the Government and delays in service make competition not feasible for the extension. <br /><br />The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) intends to issue a sole-source, modification to extend the performance period of Contract Number N01ES35504 in accordance with FAR Clause 52.217-8. This extension will provide the National Toxicology Program (NTP) with continued support for National Toxicology Program Interagency Center for the Evaluation of Alternative Toxicological Methods (NICEATM) for no more than six months beyond the current end date of April 15, 2013.</p>
<p>This contract shall be re-competed and an award is anticipated in FY 2014.</p>

<p>If you have questions regarding the event, please contact conference support at fedgovconworkshops@d2dinc.com.</p>
<p><strong>Who should attend?<br /></strong>MIHE faculty and staff who are interested in pursuing government contracts or who have initiated the process, but have not yet been successful should attend this workshop. Individuals already involved in government contracting should attend to gain additional knowledge about the process and to network with HHS staff attending the workshop. Faculty and staff from all types of MIHEs and other institutions of higher learning will find this workshop helpful.</p>
<p><strong>Why should I attend?<br /></strong>The Federal Government is an excellent, and often times, untapped resource of revenue. In this economy, educational institutions need additional sources of revenue to supplement other funding efforts. This can be done by securing contracts to support government customers with a variety of services including areas such as research projects. MIHE faculty and staff should attend a workshop so they understand the government contracting environment and have the tools necessary to navigate the government processes.</p>
<p><strong>I'm a teacher and can't afford to miss class. Can I attend part of the workshop? <br /></strong>We understand that class schedules may overlap with the workshop schedule. This is a four-hour workshop scheduled in the afternoon/early evening in hopes to avoid most scheduling conflicts. We hope that you can join us for the entire event; however there is no requirement to attend the entire workshop. Come during the time that is convenient for your schedule.</p>
<p><strong>I already know the basics of government contract. My school already has government contracts. How will this workshop help me?<br /></strong>You may be familiar with the basics; however this workshop will delve deeper into govcon topics. This includes an overview of the federal market/procurement process; grants versus contracts; market research/opportunity identification; proposal development; understanding contract pricing; and overview of contract administration and compliance. You will also have the opportunity to interact with U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) OSDBU representatives who will be on-site during the workshop.</p>

<DESC>Limited Sources Justification Notice

Description: The Occupational Health Strategic Healthcare Group (10P3D) of VHA proposes that the National Academy of Sciences convene a collaboration to advance the scientific knowledge base in organizational, social and cultural barriers to Safe Patient Handling programs.   The Workshop will be co-sponsored by other Federal Agencies including NIOSH. VHA is a partner in this Project led by the National Academies (see NAS Proposal No. 10001175). The National Academy of Science (NAS) in conjunction with the NIOSH (CDC) and VA (VHA Occupational Health) will conduct an investigative meeting and report "Project" on the institutional barriers to the practice of 'safe patient handling and movement' in health care.  VA will fund only part of the Project which focuses upon 'expanding the domains and exploring new conceptualizations of the barriers and incentives to safe patient handling and movement.  The project will examine systems issues, organization of work (i.e. management domains), social and cultural factors of patients and staff that have previously not been studied related to injury risk for patients and for-health care staff.  The NAS Board on Human Systems Integration (BOHSI) is uniquely qualified to  lead this investigation, which will provide a report on the 'Frontiers for Further Inquiry' with recommendations for the continuing the evolution of improvements for both patients and health care providers. The Board on Human Systems Integration (BOHSI) will lead this project for NAS.
