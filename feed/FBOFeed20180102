<p>d) Method of Surveillance. Sets forth the primary surveillance methods the Government will use to evaluate the<br />Contractor's performance in meeting the Contract requirements (see Column 3). Various other methods exist to monitor performance. The COR will use surveillance methods including, but not limited to, 100% inspection, random sampling, planned sampling, and validated customer complaints.</p>
<p>Regardless of the surveillance method, the COR shall always contact the CM when a defect is identified and inform the manager of the specifics of the problem. The COR will be responsible for monitoring the contractor's performance in meeting a specific performance standard/AQL.</p>
<p>Surveillance results may be used as the basis for actions against the Contractor. Services shall be measured against the above objectives and monitored with the Government's QASP. Discrepancies shall be recorded and reported on the 5th day of each month on a Contractor's Discrepancy Report (CDR). The Contractor shall acknowledge the report and make corrections before the next report period.</p>

<DESC><p>The Department of The Navy requires subject matter expertise to aid in accomplishing&nbsp; operational energy efforts including the Defense Production Act Title III Advanced Drop-in Biofuels Production Project, DON projects within the Operational Energy Capability Improvement Fund, Energy Command and Control, and Energy Conservation Measures for tactical platforms.<br /><br />In recent years, the DoN has implemented energy innovations that increase mission capability. These initiatives transformed the way Sailors and Marines view energy by changing the perception of energy as a tether to acknowledging its role as a mission enabler. Energy improvements afloat enable ships to remain on station longer between refueling. Technological innovations have enabled expeditionary forces to travel farther without resupply.<br /><br />The Government intends to award a sole source firm fixed price award to Beryl Renewables. Through their experience under N00189-17-P-0005, Beryl Renewables is the only responsible source who has the extensive program, deep industry knowledge, and naval experience required to perform this follow-on effort within the timeframe. The Operational Energy Capability Improvement Fund requires continuity of leadership in its subject matter expertise as it enacts a transition to its fundamental business rules.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Health (NIH), Clinical Center (CC) intends to award a one- year fixed- price purchase order to Harris QuadraMed Corporation, 12110 Sunset Hills Road, Suite 600, Reston, Virginia on a sole source basis for the annual acuity software license/support fee. <br />The Nursing Department is the nursing service within the NIH Clinical Center, the nation's largest clinical research hospital. The Nursing Department exists to provide nursing care and research support services for patients participating in clinical research studies conducted by investigators within the Intramural Research Programs at the National Institutes of Health's Bethesda campus. As integral research team members, Clinical Center nurses support the design, coordination, implementation, and dissemination of clinical research by NIH investigators, with a strong focus on patient safety, continuity of care and informed participation.<br />Due to the fast paced often complex level of patient care required within the Clinical Center and the Institutes supported by Nursing, the need for an intensity software system to effectively track and allocate nursing resources has been identified. There is an emerging need to gain a better understanding of patient care complexity in order to most effectively utilize the Nursing Department's nursing resources in addition to extend budgetary and strategic planning capabilities. In doing so the Nursing will be able to identify and analyze trends in our patient care population and workload that will provide us the opportunity for improved productivity and the highest standard for patient care expectations. The Nursing Department relies heavily on this system for ensuring daily adequate coverage of nursing staff on the patient care units, patient care population and workload that will provide us the opportunity for improved productivity and the highest standard for patient care expectations.

<CONTACT>Kiya Plummer 215-697-9655
<DESC>The Philadelphia Office of Fleet and Industrial Supply Center Norfolks Contracting Department in support of The Bureau of Medicine and Science (BUMED is seeking information on how an interested contractor could provide support services on behalf of the Readiness and Health Directorate of Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (BUMED) located at 7700 Arlington Blvd.; Falls Church, VA.  The contractor shall provide services to all tenants of the Readiness and Health Directorate in its mission to support the management of readiness and health.  The three major functional areas will be Health Management, Logistic Support, and Operational Support.  The contract type is anticipated to be a cost type;  single award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity type contract.
  

The mission of BUMED is to enable readiness and health for Sailors, Marines and their families. In support of this, an underlying and fundamental need for a culture of health and safety is essential to not only prepare but also strengthen and build the resilience of a ready fighting force. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) requires Navy Medicine (NAVMED) to implement measures to maintain the critical wartime medical readiness skills and core competencies of health care providers (HCP) within our MTFs and   emphasizes transforming to a High Reliability Organization (HRO).  Additionally, Navy Medicine is facing other key changes in the upcoming years such as the impending transition to the new Electronic Health Record (EHR), a shift of patient and provider expectation for the millennial generation, and increased demand for incorporating digital technologies within the healthcare experience.
  With the magnitude and pace of change occurring at BUMED and the Military Health System (MHS), consistent program support is critical in sustaining operations, transitioning programs, and implementing new initiatives.  This will require a marked increase in oversight and management by BUMED in the overall Readiness portfolio.

This is a new requirement for BUMED.  The anticipated period of performance is expected to begin 1 August 2018 and continue through 31 July 2019.  There are expected to be provisions for option years to extend services until 31 July 2022.

<DESC>The NAVSUP Weapon System Support plans to award a five year firm fixed price requirements long term contract (LTC) for the repair of seventeen head-of-family (HOF) items and fifteen family members used on the T64 engine (see Attachment A) for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis with General Electric Aviation (GEA), Cage Code 99207, located in Lynn, MA under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. The proposed requirement will require delivery of RFI repaired Aviation Depot Level Repairables (AVDLR) via a partnership between the awardee and the Fleet Readiness Center, East (FRC-E), in Cherry Point, NC. In accordance with Title 10 DoD depot capability requirements, partnering with FRC-E is required for repair of all items under this proposed requirement.
 All piece parts and components required in support of the AVDLR repair must be obtained from an approved source of supply and furnished by the Contractor. 

All items to be supported by this proposed contract have been designated as Critical Safety Items (CSI) or Critical Application Item (CAI) and must be supported in accordance with Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement 209.270. These items require Government Source Approval prior to contract award, as the items are flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support repair via full and open competition. Only the source previously approved by the Government for repair of these items (GEA) will be solicited.
 The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source, you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the NAVSUP WSS Source Approval Brochure, which can be obtained at https://www.navsup.navy.mil/public/navsup/wss/business_opps/. If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS, please submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter that forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the source approval brochure may not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may be continued based on Fleet support needs.
 The spare repairable assemblies to be repaired and/or modified under this agreement are set forth by manufacturers part number and constitute Government Property as defined in FAR clause 52.245-1 Government Property or 52.245-1 Alternate I, as applicable.

GEA is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of all the items in Attachment A and is the only known source to possess full repair capability. Complete data, drawings and the rights to the same are not available from the Government; therefore, GEA is the sole approved source of repair for all the items listed in Attachment A. Previously, a sources sought notice for this requirement was released on May 08, 2017.

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.
 All responsible sources may identify their
interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals, quotations or capability statements.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

<DESC><div>Multiple Award IDIQ Term Contract for General Constriction Repair and Alteration Services.</div>
<div><br />Maximum Order Limitation (MOL): $2,000,000.00</div>
<div><br />The General Services Administration (GSA) Mid-Atlantic Region intends to solicit proposals for a new Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) multiple award term contract for general construction repair and alteration services within the range of $2,000.00 to $150,000.00.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />Performance Location: The geographic scope will include the following counties of Northern Virginia: Alexandria, Arlington, Fairfax, Loudoun, and Prince William.</div>
<div><br />General Description of Scope of Services: This contract is to provide repair and alteration construction services. The NAICS code for this procurement is 236220 (Commercial and Institutional Building Construction) with a small business size standard of $36.5 million. The individual task orders to be placed under the contract will generally range in the dollar value of $2,000.00 to $150,000.00.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />The work to be performed under this IDIQ contract would include, but is not limited to: general office renovation, interior construction and building exterior repair, replacement and alteration work; wall partition construction, modification and alteration of floor and wall mounted telephone, signal, and power outlets to include the modification of associated conduit, surface mounted raceway, and various under floor duct systems; installation of new and the alteration of existing power panels; carpet and carpet tile installation; painting; HVAC duct work modification and repair; door, door frame, and door set hardware installation; installation of various wall coverings and draperies; communications cabling; grid ceiling and lighting installation and modification; modification of existing building fire sprinkler systems; plastering and plaster repair work; sidewalk repair/replacement, asphalt/concrete paving; alterations including but not limited to electrical, carpentry, masonry, plumbing, mechanical, architectural, landscaping, storm drainage, exterior restoration, waterproofing, repointing, cleaning, sealing, earthwork, miscellaneous drainage structures such as culverts and headwalls, pavement repair and construction and other miscellaneous minor civil work items; Roofing involving installation, repair and alteration, and removal of all types; and paving relevant to property and roads owned, leased or otherwise controlled by GSA, or other Federal authorized agencies; and other such related work.</div>
<div><br />The MOL shall be $2,000,000.00 aggregate for all task orders for the entire term of the contract. The $2,000,000.00 MOL will not be separated equally per awardee. Each contractor on the IDIQ will be able to bid on any task order, regardless of how much work has been completed previously by the contractor on the IDIQ. The minimum guarantee for this contract is $2,500.00 per contractor for the base year. There is no guaranteed minimum for any option years.</div>
<div><br />This contract will be solicited as a one (1) year base contract with two (2) one (1) year option periods, for a total potential contract period of three (3) years. This contract vehicle will be utilized by the Government for work on Government owned and leased facilities located throughout the northern Virginia counties of Alexandria, Arlington, Fairfax, Loudoun, and Prince William.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />The government's intent is to award to approximately three (3) to five (5) offerors who submit proposals which will provide the best value to the government in terms of technical qualifications and price. A seed project for the Bostetter Courthouse Parking Lot Resurfacing, located at 200 S. Washington St. Alexandria, VA. 22314, will be part of this solicitation.&nbsp; Each proposal must include a pricing proposal for this project based upon a Scope of Work that will be included in the solicitation.&nbsp; The Government intends to make award without discussion. Therefore, offerors are requested to submit their initial proposals to the Government on the most favorable terms based on technical and price factors. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />This procurement is a Total Small Business Set Aside, with one (1) contract reserved for a Woman Owned Small Business (WOSB) concern. The government has the right to award more than one contract to a WOSB concern if it is determined they represent the best value to the government in accordance with the source selection criteria. The government will only meet this concern if a proposal is received from a WOSB concern that is responsive, responsible, and receivs an overall technical score of "Acceptable", or greater, and represents a fair and reasonable price. If it is determined that no WOSB offeror proposes an acceptable proposal at fair and reasonable price, a WOSB concern will not be recommended for an award and the government will no longer be bound to make an award to this concern.</div>
<div><br />Offerors will be evaluated based on technical merit and price proposals. The selected firms will be competitively chosen in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations and source selection procedures using the Best Value tradeoff process. For this contract, technical factors, when combined, are significantly more important than price. A solicitation will be issued requesting offerors to submit in writing both a technical and a price proposal by the offer due date and time. Responsive offers will be evaluated on technical capability and price. The award will be made to the firms that represent the best value to the government. In accordance with FAR 15.404, price analysis will be used to determine price reasonableness and the offerorr's understanding of the work requirements (i.e. unreasonably high prices, as compared to other offers received and the Government Estimate, may indicate the offeror does not comprehend the requirements of the RFP) and the ability to perform the contract.</div>
<div><br />The complete solicitation package will only be available electronically on the FedBizOpps website (www.fbo.gov) on or around January 16, 2018. Potential Offerors will be responsible for downloading the solicitation and for monitoring the website for possible amendments and/or additional information. Potential Offerors must register on the FedBizOpps website to have access to solicitation material. Firms must also be registered with System for Award Management (www.sam.gov). For additional information, visit the FedBizOpps website, www.fbo.gov or the SAM website, www.sam.gov.&nbsp;</div>

<DESC>To support the bed down of F-35A aircraft at Nellis AFB, NV, additions to two existing maintenance facilities will be constructed. Facilities selected for expansion include Missile Maintenance Facility, Building 10432 and Munitions Maintenance Facility, Building 10439.
<p>Building 10432 Missile Maintenance Facility<br />The Missile Maintenance Facility is inside of the Base Munitions Storage Area perimeter. The building is located on a down-sloping site and will require fill to support construction of the bay addition and added vehicle access clearance.<br />Expansion of Building 10432 will consist of adding a single 50' x 60' (nominal) bay at the west end of the structure. The expansion bay will attach to the existing reinforced concrete blast wall at the west side of the building and will include a new reinforced concrete blast wall at the west end of the new bay. The bay will be serviced by a single 2 ton overhead hoist providing full area coverage. The roofing over the bay will consist of a standing seam metal explosive venting system with restraining devices capable of releasing blast overpressure conditions in the event of an accidental explosion.</p>
<p>Building 10439 Munitions Maintenance Facility<br />The Munitions Maintenance Facility is inside of the Base Munitions Storage Perimeter. The building is located on an up- sloping site which will require cut to clear a level site for construction of the addition and added vehicle access. Expansion of Building 10439 will consist of adding two 30' x 50' (nominal) bays at the east side of the structure. Location of existing utilities precludes construction of the expansion bays adjacent to the existing building. Therefore, the new expansion bays will be separated from the existing building by approximately 17 feet. Since the new addition will be a separate structure apart from Building 10439, NAFB Facilities Management will assign a new building number 10440 for identification. The west bay of the Building 10440 will serve as a light duty maintenance bay and the east bay will serve munitions maintenance operations. Exterior walls of Building 10440 will consist of reinforced concrete masonry units while the bay separation wall will be reinforced concrete. The munitions maintenance bay will be provided with a 2 ton overhead hoist. Roofing at the light duty bay will be a standard structural standing seam metal system, with a restrained explosive venting standing seam metal roof system installed over the munitions maintenance bay.</p>
<p>General Features<br />Existing utilities serving the buildings will be upgraded as required and extended to the new Building 10432 addition and Building 10440. At Building 10439, existing service utilities will be extended to the new Building 10440 through an above-grade utility corridor spanning over the existing below-grade utilities routed parallel to the east side of Building 10439. Lightning Protection is a key activity for these projects and will require verification during construction and a Third Party approval of the completed system.</p>
<p>THIS PROJECT IS RESTRICTED TO SMALL DISADVANTAGED BUSINESSES UNDER THE 8A PROGRAM. IT WILL BE A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP), BEST VALUE LOWEST PRICE TECHNCIALLY ACCEPTABLE. The procurement method used will be a Design-Bid-Build best value lowest price technically acceptable. Eligible offerors will be required to provide a technical and price proposal for consideration of award. The technical proposal will be evaluated based on the evaluation criteria stated in the RFP. Those offers that are determined to be Technically Acceptable will then be evaluated based on the lowest price submitted.<br />Plans and specifications will not be provided in paper copy.

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">The Air University (AU), Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama, seeks already developed curriculum to build approximately 20 hours of a transformative and highly experiential leadership curriculum for a new Human Domain Leadership Course (HDLC). <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>AU is interested in identifying companies that have the ability to initially teach classes (up to 24 times a year) and also provide "train-the-trainer" for a seamless transition as government employees are assigned to move the mission from offeror to in-house operations. The curriculum will represent roughly the first 2.5 days of a 5-day course for personnel selected to their first command assignment (i.e., high potential officers typically at the 12-18 year point of commissioned service). Most students will already have had leadership education of some sort earlier in their career, so the curriculum should be highly impactful in order to reframe the students' self-perspective in their role as a leader. The curriculum should include both platform and interactive-based lessons, and achieve objectives in both the affective and cognitive learning domains. The curriculum must address the complexities of the human domain as it relates to leadership; be grounded in current academic research on leadership, management, and communication; and have strong linkage to industry best practices. It must also be highly applicable to Air Force (AF) squadron commanders, or have the ability to be adapted to an AF squadron command via integration meetings with AF representatives and the course director. </span></p>

This factor evaluates ability of the AE firm, given their current projected workload and the availability of their key personnel, to accomplish the possible myriad of design projects in the required time. 

The general workload and staffing capacity of the design office will be evaluated.
List current projects with a design fee of greater than $20,000 being designed in the firms  office. 
Indicate the firms  present workload and the availability 
of the project team (including sub-consultants) for the specified contract performance period;
describe experience in successfully delivering projects per 
performance schedule, providing timely construction support, and successfully completing multiple projects with similar delivery dates;


PAST PERFORMANCE: VISN2 will evaluate past performance on recent and relevant contracts with government  agencies (emphasis on VA work) and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, compliance with performance schedules and a record of significant claims against the firm due to improper or incomplete engineering services (references required). 
Recent is defined as performance occurring within 5 years of the date of this Sources Sought, except that ongoing projects must have begun no less than one (1) year prior to the issuance of this Sources Sought.
Relevancy is defined as performance of work on projects that are similar in scope to the types of projects anticipated under the resultant contracts.
Respondents with no previous past performance shall state this when addressing the selection criteria. Where there is no record of past performance, the proposal will be evaluated neither favorably nor unfavorably. Superior performance ratings on relevant projects may be considered more favorably in the evaluation.
Past Performance Submission Requirements: 
Submit a minimal of three (3) references; any of the following evaluations are acceptable:
A-E Contractor Appraisal Support System (ACASS), 
Contractor Performance Assessment Report System (CPARS), or 
Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) evaluation for each project submitted under Criterion 2.
If a completed ACASS/CPARS evaluation is available, it shall be submitted with the completed SF330 package. If there is not a completed ACASS/CPARS evaluation, the PPQ included with this notice (attachment #1)  is provided for the Offeror or its team members to submit for each project included in criterion (2). If a PPQ is submitted, but an official ACASS/CPARS evaluation is found for that project in government databases, the official evaluation will take precedence. If an ACASS/CPARS evaluation is not available, ensure correct phone numbers and email addresses are provided for each contract customer/reference. Completed PPQs should be submitted with your SF330. If the A-E is unable to obtain a completed PPQ from a contract customer/reference for a project before the response date set forth in this notice, the A-E should complete and submit with their response the first page of the PPQ (Attachment #1), including contract and point of contact information for the respective projects. 
A-Es should follow-up with references to ensure timely submittal of questionnaires. A-Es shall not incorporate by references into their response ACASS/CPARS or PPQ evaluations previously submitted in response to other A-E services procurements. However, this does not preclude the Government from utilizing previously submitted PPQ information in the past performance evaluation. 

LOCATION
The A/E Firm proximity to the VA Medical Center New York Campus, 10010 is an evaluation criteria. 
This distance is determined according to http://maps.google.com/
This factor evaluates the distance the AE firm's design office or offices lies from the location of work.  Please provide the address(es) and distance of your closest office to the address listed below.

<DESC><strong>Description of Requirements</strong>
<p>The U.S. Forest Service engages in the suppression of wildland fires on a large scale on an annual basis utilizing firefighting crews provide by the agency and crews hired under contract. Firefighting crews typically perform work utilizing hand tools to construct fire line. Power saws are utilized to clear brush and fall trees. In addition crews often construct hose lays to bring water to the fire area. The hand tools, power saws, and hose lays are also utilized during mop-up once the fire has been contained.</p>
<p>The work environment would be forested and is often in steep terrain that is uneven, rocky, and covered in vegetation. Working conditions are often extreme due to smoke and hot, dry weather conditions while working near the radiant heat of the fire environment. The hazardous nature of the work requires that personal protective equipment be utilized at all times during work hours.</p>
<p>In addition, the work area identified includes Operable Unit 3 (OU3) of the Libby Superfund as designated by the Environmental Protection Agency. The area, which is approximately 30,000 acres in size, has documented presence of Libby Amphibole Asbestos (LAA) in the tree bark, duff, and soil. LAA is known to cause asbestos related diseases. Additional information is available at: https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/cursites/csitinfo.cfm?id=0801744</p>
<p>Due to the known presence of LAA in OU3, firefighting personnel would be required to wear respiratory protection during wildfire response and go through decontamination prior to leaving the OU3 Asbestos Response boundary.</p>

<p>NORTH AMERICAN CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE<br />The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is  811219-Other Electronic and Precision Equipment Repair and Maintenance with associated small business size standard of $20.5 million.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND<br />The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) was officially established in fiscal year 2012 to transform the translational science process so that new treatments and cures for disease can be delivered to patients faster. NCATS, one of 27 Institutes and Centers (ICs) at NIH, strives to develop innovations to reduce, remove or bypass costly and time-consuming bottlenecks in the translational research pipeline in an effort to speed the delivery of new drugs, diagnostics and medical devices to patients.</p>
<p>The NCATS Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC) is tasked with identifying and developing novel small molecule leads against a wide spectrum of human disease targets, which it accomplishes by screening thousands of small molecules in collaboration with both intra-and extramural researchers. In pursuit of this goal, the Center has a strong internal transdisciplinary team of scientists who continually discover novel small molecules and develop novel disease models for application against a wide range of human diseases.</p>
<p>The discovery of probe molecules and development of human disease models that could serve as starting points for therapeutics is of great interest within NCATS. NCATS started several projects developing tissues of human disease models using 3D bioprinting technology. As a tool for validation of 3D microstructure, NCATS purchased a Zeiss confocal microscope (S/N 2502000760) to utilize.

All Small Business companies with the capability and availability to perform the requirement under the applicable NAICS code are invited to submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>NORTH AMERICAN CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE<br />The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is  811219-Other Electronic and Precision Equipment Repair and Maintenance with associated small business size standard of $20.5 million.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND<br />The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) was officially established in fiscal year 2012 to transform the translational science process so that new treatments and cures for disease can be delivered to patients faster. NCATS, one of 27 Institutes and Centers (ICs) at NIH, strives to develop innovations to reduce, remove or bypass costly and time-consuming bottlenecks in the translational research pipeline in an effort to speed the delivery of new drugs, diagnostics and medical devices to patients.</p>
<p>The NCATS Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC) is tasked with identifying and developing novel small molecule leads against a wide spectrum of human disease targets, which it accomplishes by screening thousands of small molecules in collaboration with both intra-and extramural researchers. In pursuit of this goal, the Center has a strong internal transdisciplinary team of scientists who continually discover novel small molecules and develop novel disease models for application against a wide range of human diseases.</p>
<p>The discovery of probe molecules and development of human disease models that could serve as starting points for therapeutics is of great interest within NCATS. NCATS started several projects developing tissues of human disease models using 3D bioprinting technology. As a tool for validation of 3D microstructure, NCATS purchased a Leica SP8 Liachroic IR confocal microscope/two photon system (S/N 8100001594) to utilize. The Leica confocal microscope has provided high quality of images for optimization of bioprinting process, validation, and quality controls for insight on efficacy across many types of engineered tissues and will help progress and provide critical scientific guidance on projects performed by NCATS.</p>
<p>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES<br />The purpose of this potential requirement is to obtain annual maintenance service on the subject Leica SP8 Liachroic IR confocal microscope/two photon system (S/N 8100001594) that is manufactured and previously purchased from Leica Microsystems from an authorized service provider by OEM-certified technicians. The NCGC operates the subject system at 9800 Medical Center Drive, Rockville, MD 20850 and has provided high quality of images for optimization of bioprinting process, validation, and quality control measures.</p>

<DESC>The National Library of Medicine (NLM), part of the Department of Health and Human Services' National Institutes of Health, is issuing this sources sought synopsis as a means of conducting market research to identify parties having an interest in and the resources to support this requirement to the Exhibition Program at the NLM to produce content (scripts and assets) about the social and cultural history of science, medicine, and technology for audiences that include subject matter experts, professionals, and the general public around the world. Exhibition Program staff then transform this content into multiple formats. Specifically: 1) Exhibition Program staff install small special displays in the National Library of Medicine History of Medicine Division reading room. The audience for these special displays include visitors to the National Library of Medicine, the National Institutes of Health community, and the public with an interest in a topic; 2) Exhibition Program staff manage a traveling exhibition service, which provides traveling banner exhibitions to a worldwide network of academic libraries, public libraries, professional organizations, and cultural institutions. The audiences for traveling banner exhibitions include staff, patrons, and visitors to those host organizations; and 3) Exhibition Program staff, in cooperation with other National Library of Medicine offices, adapt exhibition content to the online environment. For these online exhibitions, Exhibition Program staff create education resources to support each exhibition; and they initiate the digitization of National Library of Medicine collections relevant to the exhibition topic and include those materials in the online exhibition.<br /><br />
<p>To find more information about the Exhibition Program at NLM and its portfolio of exhibition projects please go to the website. <br /><br />Museum Specialists support full-time Exhibition Program staff that includes a Section Head, an Exhibition Educator, an Exhibition Registrar/Traveling Services Manager, and an Exhibition Coordinator.<br /><br />Museum Specialists are specialized within the subject area of the museum or exhibition development fields, or the humanities (e.g.: Anthropology, Literature or English, History, Visual Arts, Linguistics, etc.) They may specialize further in one of the basic functional areas found in museums (management of the collection, conservation of objects, educational responsibilities, etc.), in academia (research, writing, editing, educating, etc.), or in content production for other fields (documentaries, education products, books, theater, etc.). Museum specialists may be responsible for acquisitions, record keeping, loans, packing + shipping; public education; managing digital assets; or coordinating or programming website development. The variation in tasks and the requisite specialization is as broad as the subject of the cultural production and the humanities thus it is impossible to detail the possible variations in Museum Specialist assignments.<br /><br />The result of this market research will contribute to determining the method of procurement. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this procurement is 712110, Museums. The small business size standard is $27.5 million.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, intends to negotiate with High Precision Devices, located in Boulder, CO, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b), soliciting from a single source, for one (1) 10 kW Electronics crate.
<p>The unique technical specifications for this crate are the following: it has two sensors that operate simultaneously. The 10 kW Electronics Crate is a custom device which must be fully compatible with another electronics crate that NIST made 5 or 6 years ago for the U.S. Air Force. After this device was made, NIST transferred the details of the design and manufacturing process through a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program. NIST no longer retains the expertise to build a copy of this device. This device will be used for high precision measurement of extremely high power lasers. Accuracy and safety is of great concern. The 10 kW Electronics Crate must be identical in function and operation to what has already been delivered to the Air Force.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code is 334513- Instruments and Related Products Manufacturing<br />for Measuring, Displaying, and Controlling Industrial Process Variables with a Size Standard of 750 employees. NIST anticipates negotiating and awarding a firm-fixed-price purchase order to High Precision Devices, Inc. for this requirement.</p>
<p>Interested parties that can demonstrate that they could satisfy the requirement listed above for NIST must clearly and unambiguously identify their capability to do so in writing on or before the response date for this notice. This notice of intent is not a solicitation. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether competitive procedures could be used for this acquisition. If competitive procedures are not used it is estimated that an award will be issued by February 15, 2018. Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing via email to angela.hitt@nist.gov. All responses to this notice of intent must be submitted so that they are received at angela.hitt@nist.gov no later than January 8, 2018 at 3:00 p.m. MST.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">NOAA's NMFS is responsible for the stewardship of the nation's ocean resources and their habitat. It provides vital services for the nation: productive and sustainable fisheries, safe sources of seafood, the recovery and conservation of protected resources, and healthy ecosystems --- all backed by sound science and an ecosystem-based approach to management. The equipment to be purchased serves NMFS's missions by providing Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology products for fish and wildlife research, which is only available through Biomark, Inc. (Biomark). Biomark is a worldwide leader in such RFID tag technology.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">NMFS requires Biomark's commercially available custom Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tag detection systems, as well as tagging and data collection tables. Biomark has played a major role in designing and developing fabrication techniques to reliably operate PIT tag antennas underwater (a major breakthrough in evaluation and monitoring technique), which has been an on-going requirement for NMFS.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Some examples of Biomark's specific equipment that NMFS requires include Biomark FS3001 transceivers and associated power supplies; Biomark FS3001 PIT tag antennas; Biomark exciter cables that will be permanently mounted in hydroelectric facilities operated and installed by agencies, such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; and extremely high-power RFID detection transceivers.<br /><br />Biomark's equipment serves NOAA/NMFS missions by providing specialized and proprietary technology only available through Biomark. No other businesses provide this specific scientific equipment with its technical capabilities, and there are no licensed vendors representing Biomark.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Responses to this notice must be provided within <strong>fifteen (15) calendar days</strong> from the date of this notice. Vendors who believe they can meet this requirement are required to submit, in writing, an affirmative response demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the requirement. All written responses must include proof of possessing permits and a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information, demonstrating their ability to meet the requirement. The response must be sufficient to permit agency analysis to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirement. Failure to submit such documentation will result in the Government proceeding as previously stated. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Affirmative written responses must be received no later than <strong>8:00 AM (Pacific Standard Time), Wednesday, 17 January 2018</strong>. The responses must be submitted <strong><em>via e-mail</em></strong> to Michael Drummond, Contract Specialist, at <a href="mailto:michael.drummond@noaa.gov">michael.drummond@noaa.gov</a>, or <em><strong>via hard copy</strong></em> to Michael Drummond, Contract Specialist, U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Western Acquisition Division, Western Regional Center, Building 1, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115.</p>

The Agency intends to award a sole source contract to Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FS-ISAC), 12020 Sunrise Valley Drive, Reston, VA 20191 to procure services in support of the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB).

<p>The procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 519190.</p>
<p>FS-ISAC, or the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center, is the global financial industry's go to resource for cyber and physical threat intelligence analysis and sharing. FS-ISAC is unique in that it was created by and for members and operates as a member-owned non profit entity. While FS-ISAC has always worked with members that have operations around the globe, in early 2013 FS-ISAC's board approved an extension to its charter to share information between financial services firms world-wide. Constantly gathering reliable and timely information from financial services providers, commercial security firms, federal/national, state and local government agencies, law enforcement and other trusted resources, the FS-ISAC is now uniquely positioned to quickly disseminate physical and cyber threat alerts and other critical information.</p>
<p>When attacks occur, early warning and expert advice can mean the difference between business continuity and widespread business catastrophe. Procuring this membership will give FRTIB worldwide timely notification and authoritative information specifically designed to help protect critical systems and assets from physical and cyber security threats.<br />Furthermore, The FS-ISAC also provides an anonymous information sharing capability across the entire financial services industry. Upon receiving a submission, industry experts verify and analyze the threat and identify any recommended solutions before alerting FS-ISAC members. This assures that member firms receive the latest tried-and-true procedures and best practices for guarding against known and emerging security threats. FS-ISAC can do their part to protect our industry and its vital role in critical infrastructure.</p>

<p>Requirement<br />The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), requires Bordetella-Free Weanling Baboons.</p>
<p>Background/Statement of Need<br />Pertussis is an acute, highly contagious, potentially life threatening respiratory disease, caused by the Gram-negative bacterium Bordetella pertussis. The underlying factors leading to the failure of public health measures to control pertussis disease using currently licensed vaccines are poorly understood. A more complete understanding of this disease and of the mechanisms of vaccine-mediated protection is a critical public health need.  Currently, the baboon model of pertussis, developed in the laboratories of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), is the only animal model of pertussis that recapitulates the disease as observed in human patients. The use of this animal model to study the relative effectiveness of vaccination with experimental pertussis vaccines and the testing of candidate therapeutics requires the delivery of weanling baboons to the CBER primate facility.</p>
<p>Minimum Requirements:<br /> - Bordetella-Free Weanling Baboons <br /> - The contractor shall be able to provide all required age-matched baboons in a single delivery (between 6-12 months of age at time of delivery) once all become available <br /> - All baboons shall be examined by a licensed veterinarian, Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) as defined by the Animal Welfare Act Regulations (9 CFR, Subchapter A, Part 1 - Definition of Terms), experienced in Non-Human Primates (NHP) medicine and surgery, and found to be in good health prior to shipping accompanied by a certificate of health for each baboon<br /> - Baboons shall be shipped by USDA-licensed carriers and the Contractor shall be responsible for meeting all requirements associated with shipment and delivery of animals<br /> - Shippers shall comply with Animal Welfare Act Regulations regarding the transportation standards for NHP, Title 9, Subchapter A - Part 3 -- Transportation Standards.<br /> - Contractor shall maintain liaison with carrier personnel in order to assure the animals receive proper care in accordance with USDA standards and guidelines during transit<br /> - Upon delivery of Baboons to CBER primate facility they shall be quarantine and delivery acceptance shall accrue after determination the Baboons are of age, gender and weight as specified, Bordetella-Free, and in good health.  Acceptance of the animals will be made by the supervising veterinarian at the quarantine facility.  Any unacceptable animal(s) shall be promptly replaced at no additional cost to the Government.</p>

<p>Contractor Performance Evaluation (s)<br />In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 42.15, FDA will complete annual and final contractor performance evaluations.  Annual evaluations will be prepared to coincide with the anniversary date of the contract.  Additional interim performance evaluations may be prepared at the CO's discretion, as necessary. Final performance evaluations will be completed upon contract expiration.</p>
<p>FDA will utilize the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) in order to execute annual and final contractor performance evaluations. CPARS is a secure Internet website located at https://www.cpars.gov/main/cparsmain.htm. FDA will register the contractor in CPARS upon receipt of the name and email address of two (2) individuals who will be responsible for serving as the Contractor's primary and alternate CPARS contacts.  Once FDA registers the contractor in CPARS, the Contractor will receive an automated CPARS email message which contains User IDs and instructions for creating a password.</p>
<p>Once a performance evaluation is issued, the Contractor's primary and alternate CPARS contact will receive an email instructing them to logon to CPARS in order to review the performance evaluation.  The Contractor has 14 calendar days from the date of performance evaluation issuance in which to review the evaluation.  If the Contractor is in agreement with the performance evaluation outcome, the evaluation becomes final.  Should the Contractor be in disagreement with the performance evaluation outcome, rebuttal comments must be submitted via the CPARS within 30 days from date the evaluation was issued by FDA.  Any disagreement between the CO and the Contractor will be referred to a contracting official one level above the CO, whose decision will be final.</p>
<p>Copies of each performance evaluation and contractor responses, if any, will be retained as part of the official contract file and will be used to support future award decisions. Evaluations will also be stored for a 3 year period (6 years for construction) in the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) at www.ppirs.gov.</p>
<p>Contractors may obtain CPARS training material and register for on-line training at https://www.cpars.gov/main/cparsmain.htm. There is no fee for registration or use of the CPARS system.</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--</p>
<p align="left">(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p align="left">(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or</p>
<p align="left">commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p align="left">(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p align="left">(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p align="left">(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p align="left">(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p align="left">(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p align="left">(ii) Examples.</p>
<p align="left">(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</p>
<p align="left">(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p align="left">(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p align="left">(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p align="left">(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]</p>

<p align="left">(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.</p>

<p align="left">(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Labor Standards wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and</p>
<p align="left">(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.</p>

Liquid milk, cheese, certain processed cheese products, butter, yogurt, ice cream, mayonnaise, salad dressings, and other similar products, fall within this classification. Nothing in the Act limits this classification to refrigerated products.

If the invoice does not comply with these requirements, the designated billing office will return it within 7 days after receipt (3 days for meat, meat food products, or fish; 5 days for perishable agricultural commodities, dairy products, edible fats or oils, and food products prepared from edible fats or oils), with the reasons why it is not a proper invoice. The Government will take into account untimely notification when computing any interest penalty owed the Contractor.</p>
<p align="left">(i) Name and address of the Contractor.</p>
<p align="left">(ii) Invoice date and invoice number. (The Contractor should date invoices as close as possible to the date of the mailing or transmission.)</p>
<p align="left">(iii) Contract number or other authorization for supplies delivered or services performed (including order number and contract line item number).</p>
<p align="left">(iv) Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price, and extended price of supplies delivered or services performed.</p>
<p align="left">(v) Shipping and payment terms (e.g., shipment number and date of shipment, discount for prompt payment terms). Bill of lading number and weight of shipment will be shown for shipments on Government bills of lading.</p>
<p align="left">(vi) Name and address of Contractor official to whom payment is to be sent (must be the same as that in the contract or in a proper notice of assignment).</p>
<p align="left">(vii) Name (where practicable), title, phone number, and mailing address of person to notify in the event of a defective invoice.</p>
<p align="left">(viii) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). The Contractor shall include its TIN on the invoice only if required elsewhere in this contract.</p>
<p align="left">(ix) Electronic funds transfer (EFT) banking information.</p>
<p align="left">(A) The Contractor shall include EFT banking information on the invoice only if required elsewhere in this contract.</p>
<p align="left">(B) If EFT banking information is not required to be on the invoice, in order for the invoice to be a proper invoice, the Contractor shall have submitted correct EFT banking information in accordance with the applicable solicitation provision (e.g., 52.232-38, Submission of Electronic Funds Transfer Information with Offer), contract clause (e.g., 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic funds Transfer- System for Award Management, or 52.232-34, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer--Other Than System for Award Management), or applicable agency procedures.</p>
<p align="left">(C) EFT banking information is not required if the Government waived the requirement to pay by EFT.</p>
<p align="left">(x) Any other information or documentation required by the contract (e.g.. evidence of shipment.)</p>
<p align="left">(4) Interest penalty. The designated payment office will pay an interest penalty automatically, without request from the Contractor, if payment is not made by the due date and the conditions listed in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (a)(4)(iii) of this clause are met, if applicable. However, when the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the designated payment office may make payment on the following working day without incurring a late payment interest penalty.</p>
<p align="left">(i) The designated billing office received a proper invoice.</p>
<p align="left">(ii) The Government processed a receiving report or other Government documentation authorizing payment, and there was no disagreement over quantity, quality, or Contractor compliance with any contract term or condition.</p>
<p align="left">(iii) In the case of a final invoice for any balance of funds due the Contractor for supplies delivered or services performed, the amount was not subject to further contract settlement actions between the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p align="left">(5) Computing penalty amount. The Government will compute the interest penalty in accordance with Office of Management and Budget prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315.</p>
<p align="left">(i) For the sole purpose of computing an interest penalty that might be due the Contractor, Government acceptance is deemed to occur constructively on the 7th day (unless otherwise specified in this contract) after the Contractor delivers the supplies or performs the services in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract, unless there is a disagreement over quantity, quality, or Contractor compliance with a contract provision. If actual acceptance occurs within the constructive acceptance period, the Government will base the determination of an interest penalty on the actual date of acceptance. The constructive acceptance requirement does not, however, compel Government officials to accept supplies or services, perform contract administration functions, or make payment prior to fulfilling their responsibilities.</p>
<p align="left">(ii) The prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR 1315.10(c) do not require the Government to pay interest penalties if payment delays are due to disagreement between the Government and the Contractor over the payment amount or other issues involving contract compliance, or on amounts temporarily withheld or retained in accordance with the terms of the contract. The Government and the Contractor shall resolve claims involving disputes and any interest that may be payable in accordance with the clause at FAR 52.233-1, Disputes.</p>
<p align="left">(6) Discounts for prompt payment. The designated payment office will pay an interest penalty automatically, without request from the Contractor, if the Government takes a discount for prompt payment improperly. The Government will calculate the interest penalty in accordance with the prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315.</p>
<p align="left">(7) Additional interest penalty.</p>
<p align="left">(i) The designated payment office will pay a penalty amount, calculated in accordance with the prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315 in addition to the interest penalty amount only if--</p>
<p align="left">(A) The Government owes an interest penalty of $1 or more;</p>
<p align="left">(B) The designated payment office does not pay the interest penalty within 10 days after the date the invoice amount is paid; and</p>
<p align="left">(C) The Contractor makes a written demand to the designated payment office for additional penalty payment, in accordance with paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of this clause, postmarked no later than 40 days after the invoice amount is paid.</p>
<p align="left">(ii)</p>
<p align="left">(A) The Contractor shall support written demands for additional penalty payments with the following data. The Government will not request any additional data. The Contractor shall --</p>
<p align="left">(1) Specifically assert that late payment interest is due under a specific invoice, and request payment of all overdue late payment interest penalty and such additional penalty as may be required;</p>
<p align="left">(2) Attach a copy of the invoice on which the unpaid late payment interest was due; and</p>
<p align="left">(3) State that payment of the principal has been received, including the date of receipt.</p>
<p align="left">(B) If there is no postmark or the postmark is illegible--</p>
<p align="left">(1) The designated payment office that receives the demand will annotate it with the date of receipt, provided the demand is received on or before the 40th day after payment was made; or</p>
<p align="left">(2) If the designated payment office fails to make the required annotation, the Government will determine the demand's validity based on the date the Contractor has placed on the demand; provided such date is no later than the 40th day after payment was made.</p>
<p align="left">(iii) The additional penalty does not apply to payments regulated by other Government regulations (e.g., payments under utility contracts subject to tariffs and regulation).</p>
<p align="left">(b) Contract financing payments. If this contract provides for contract financing, the Government will make contract financing payments in accordance with the applicable contract financing clause.</p>
<p align="left">(c) Fast payment procedure due dates. If this contract contains the clause at 52.213-1, Fast Payment Procedure, payments will be made within 15 days after the date of receipt of the invoice.</p>
<p align="left">(d) Overpayments. If the Contractor becomes aware of a duplicate contract financing or invoice payment or that the Government has otherwise overpaid on a contract financing or invoice payment, the Contractor shall-</p>
<p align="left">(1) Remit the overpayment amount to the payment office cited in the contract along with a description of the overpayment including the-</p>
<p align="left">(i) Circumstances of the overpayment (e.g., duplicate payment, erroneous payment, liquidation errors, date(s) of overpayment);</p>
<p align="left">(ii) Affected contract number and delivery order number if applicable;</p>
<p align="left">(iii) Affected contract line item or subline item, if applicable; and</p>
<p align="left">(iv) Contractor point of contact.</p>
<p align="left">(2) Provide a copy of the remittance and supporting documentation to the Contracting Officer.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. <br />Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed. <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  It is preferable
that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest
level possible before considering the more formal process described below.
The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to
seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute
Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government
Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or
performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within
the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal
is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely,
protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you
want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must
request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All
other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for
resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil. Packages sent Federal Express or UPS should be addressed to: HQ Army Material Command
Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Rm 2-1SE3401 Ft Belvoir, VA
22060-5527. The AMC-Level Protest procedures are found at:
http://www.amc.army.mil/pa/COMMANDCOUNSEL.asp. If internet access is not
available, contact the HQ, AMC to obtain the AMC-Level Protest procedures.<BR><BR>The selected Offeror must comply with the following commercial item terms and conditions, which are incorporated herein by reference: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition; FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation- Commercial Items;  FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items - the selected offeror must submit a completed copy of the listed representations and certifications; FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, paragraph (a) and the following clauses in paragraph (b): 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37, 52.225-13, 52.232-34.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.<BR><BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.<BR><BR>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.<BR><BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations.

(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.<BR><BR>(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<BR><BR>(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items:

The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through FAR Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-96 effective November 6, 2017. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 811310 with a size standard of $7.5M. A firm fixed price contract will be awarded using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.<br /><br />The period of performance is 12-months from date of award with two additional 12-month option periods for the Barrow systems.   A)  For the option periods, assume no service at Fairbanks site; service is only needed in Barrow pursuant to FAR 52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract.  (B) For Fairbanks, include as an optional second preventative maintenance of the two USPs between September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2018.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce/National Environmental Satellite data and Information Service, Field Delegate requires the following:<br />PURPOSE:<br /><br />The purpose of this procurement is to establish a Service Support Agreement (SSA) for maintenance and support for the Uninterruptable Power Source (UPS) systems at the NOAA/NESDIS Fairbanks Command and Data Acquisition Station (FCDAS) in Fairbanks, Alaska, and at the FCDAS remote antenna site in Barrow, Alaska.</p>
<p>SCOPE OR MISSION:<br />FCDAS requires preventive maintenance and technical support for emergency power systems and components, including batteries, on-site emergency service, travel to and from the sites, labor, replacement parts, tech support, call management, field modifications, emergency telephone support 7 days/week, 24 hours/day. FCDAS provides essential satellite ground system services for earth observation spacecraft in support of property, life, and economic activities of the United States. Electrical power is mission-critical, and the UPS systems provide conditioned electrical power to all ground system equipment, including temporary power continuity in the event of a commercial power outage. Regular preventive maintenance and technical support on the UPS systems is required to maintain 99.9999% availability of critical infrastructure.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:<br />FCDAS is a 24/7 satellite tracking station operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in support of national and international operational and research environmental monitoring spacecraft located near Fox, Alaska, approximately 15 miles northeast of Fairbanks. <br />FCDAS plans to replace the existing UPS systems in the summer of 2018. The new UPS will be under warranty and no services will be needed for it under this solicitation.   FCDAS also operates an unmanned satellite tracking system at the NOAA Earth Systems Research Laboratory in Barrow, Alaska. Barrow is a remote community on the North Slope where travel and working conditions are often difficult. The FCDAS UPS systems consist of two MGE Uninterruptable Power Source (UPS) Model E6TUPS500 UPS systems, S/N 208488.01 and 208488.06, which are critical elements of the electrical power infrastructure on site. The systems condition power and provide temporary backup power to the entire site. In the event of commercial power failure, the UPS systems hold station power for up to 30 minutes or until station generators automatically engage. The Barrow UPS consists of one APC UPS Model SUVTP15KF4B4S, 15kVA 208V 3PH UPS with battery modules and one SBPSU10K15F-WP External Maintenance bypass panel. The Barrow site does not have emergency generators, and the UPS is intended to feed conditioned power to the antenna equipment for brief commercial outages.</p>

Under his cognizance, the Army executes approximately 297,000 contracting actions with obligations over $74 billion annually.</p>
<p>As Commander of ACC, MG Simpson enables Army readiness through global, expeditionary contracting support to warfighters engaged in military operations, weapon systems acquisition, life cycle management, sustainment and acquisition of goods and services vital to the Soldier's mission and well-being. The ACC workforce includes more than 6,000 military and civilian personnel at more than 100 locations worldwide. ACC awarded and managed more than 165,000 contract actions valued at more than $62 billion in fiscal year 2017.</p>
<p>The ACC-ORL PALT session is scheduled for Tuesday, 9 January 2018 from 0900-1000 in Partnership III, Room 321, 3039 Technology Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826. A photo ID is required for sign-in on the day of the PALT session. There is no advance registration.</p>

REQUIREMENTS BEING SOLICITED FROM LOCAL SOURCES: All sources may submit a proposal or quote as applicable. However, the Republic of Korea (ROK)-United States (U.S.) Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), precludes the U.S. Government from granting Invited Contractor or Technical Representative status to any offeror, for this requirement. All sources submitting a proposal or quote, as applicable, including U.S. sources, must already have, or obtain the requisite business license directly from the ROK Government, and conduct business in accordance with all applicable ROK laws, including but not limited to, rules and policies regarding labor, taxation, and immigration. Any contractor not already doing business in Korea as a local source, must submit adequate verification in its initial proposal or quote, that it has the requisite authorization and capacity to compete for the requirement as a local source, and to perform the contract as a local source. If an initial proposal does not fully demonstrate this authorization and capacity, it will not be further considered for award. Whether an offeror qualifies as a local source shall be determined by the Contracting Officer.

Additionally, this market survey is being conducted to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists, to identify capability among small businesses, SEDB/8a sources, and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses. This is the third Market Survey from the Enterprise Information Display System (E-IDS) Program. See also Solicitation Numbers 25844 and 27890 available at faaco.faa.gov. Where information previously provided answers the following questions, a resubmittal of the same information is sufficient.

Nature of this Market Survey
(a)	This is not a Screening Information Request (SIR) or Request for Proposals (RFP) of any kind;
(b)	This is not a commitment to issue a SIR or RFP of any kind;
(c)	The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals;
(d)	The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing any response to this RFI; and
(e)	Any costs associated with any response to this RFI are solely at the interested vendors expense

<DESC>1.0	INTRODUCTION/BACGROUND

The mission of Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (BUMED) is to enable readiness and health for Sailors, Marines and their families. In support of this, an underlying and fundamental need for a culture of health and safety is essential to not only prepare but also strengthen and build the resilience of a ready fighting force. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) requires Navy Medicine (NAVMED) to implement measures to maintain the critical wartime medical readiness skills and core competencies of health care providers (HCP) within our MTFs and   emphasizes transforming to a High Reliability Organization (HRO).  Additionally, Navy Medicine is facing other key changes in the upcoming years such as the impending transition to the new Electronic Health Record (EHR), a shift of patient and provider expectation for the millennial generation, and increased demand for incorporating digital technologies within the healthcare experience.
  With the magnitude and pace of change occurring at BUMED and the Military Health System (MHS), consistent program support is critical in sustaining operations, transitioning programs, and implementing new initiatives.  This will require a marked increase in oversight and management by BUMED in the overall Readiness portfolio.

<p style="margin: 0px;">The USCG ALC is responsible for providing aviation support in DLM, engineering, supply, procurement, information services, and acquisition project execution for the USCG&rsquo;s aviation community. The C-130H and C-130J aircraft are the USCG's LRS aircraft providing critical Search and Rescue, Law Enforcement, Logistics, and Marine Environmental Protection response to the United States of America.<br /><br />SEE ATTACHMENTS:<br /><br />Request for Proposal <br /><br />ATTACHMENT A Schedule<br /><br />ATTACHMENT B Statement of Work<br />SOW Table of&nbsp;Contents<br /><br />ATTACHMENT C Past Performance Questionnaire<br /><br />Wage Determination 2015-4405 Rev 5 12/26/2017<br /><br />Statement of Work Attachments may be obtained by contacting Victoria Kocher at the email address in this solicitation.</p>

This terminology is therefore rather different than any commercial reference to "IMDG" containers as being suitable for all hazardous materials, and "non-IMDG" not suitable for movement of hazardous materials.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>U.S. DoD "IMDG" containers therefore need to be in a superior condition as required per military standard MIL-STD-3037 and per 49 CFR &sect;176.172."<br /><br />3.
