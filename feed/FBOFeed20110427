<p class="MsoNormal">The American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC) intends to create battle maps, to honor the service, sacrifice and achievements of the U.S. Armed Forces during the Vietnam conflict, at its memorial in Honolulu, Hawaii.<span>&nbsp; </span>The goal is to build polychromatic concrete mosaic maps identical to the World War II and Korean War maps that are currently at the memorial.<span>&nbsp; </span>The existing maps were built in the period between 1969 and 1971 by Earley Studios in Manassas, Virginia.<span>&nbsp; </span>An example of one of these maps is attached.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The maps would be built as precast concrete panels, which would be fitted into a new pavilion to be built at the ABMC&rsquo;s Honolulu Memorial (<a href="http://www.abmc.gov/memorials/memorials/hn.php">http://www.abmc.gov/memorials/memorials/hn.php</a>).<span>&nbsp; </span>Conceptually, the new pavilion would sit on a foundation roughly 14 feet by 14 feet in dimension.<span>&nbsp; </span>The maps would rest on two adjacent walls and would fit into two panels, which would be roughly 10 feet by 10 feet in dimension.<span>&nbsp; </span>The two panels would include multiple maps along with text and graphics, similar to the existing maps for WWII and the Korean War.<span>&nbsp; </span>A total of five maps would fit into the two panels.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The ABMC is looking for an architect, an engineer or other firm capable of developing the construction process specifications, drawings and quality control team that would be used to solicit the fabrication services and ensure the quality of the final product.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The desired team would be highly experienced in the process used by John Earley and the Earley Studio.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This Request For Information (RFI) is to identify possible firms that have such experience and capabilities and who might be interested in developing a proposal for such work.<span>&nbsp; </span>Any interested individual or firm should submit a portfolio of their applicable experiences which cannot exceed 5 pages.<span>&nbsp; </span>The response should also include a short (not to exceed one page) description of how they would develop such a team and identify its key players.<span>&nbsp; </span>Since the ABMC would be responsible for the development of an artist&rsquo;s rendition of the maps to be constructed, such a team would not need to include the historical and graphical artistic aspects of the work.</p>

<DESC>Synopsis
Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) Program Planar Target Support Contract
Solicitation Number:  DE-SOL-0002953
April 27, 2011
The Department of Energy (DOE), National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) has an ongoing need for a wide variety of very complex targets for Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) and related High Energy Density Physics (HEDP) experiments.  The NNSA program in ICF is an important component of the agency?s Stockpile Stewardship Program.  Stockpile Stewardship allows the United States Government to maintain a safe and reliable nuclear arsenal without nuclear testing.  ICF/HEDP targets are complex, multi-component, systems often employing specialized materials.  Planar (flat) targets for the ICF/HEDP Program will be provided through the planned solicitation described here.   
Planar targets are typically several mm in length and width, and can have thicknesses ranging from a few to several hundred microns.  The surface of the planar target varies according to its specification.  Some are flat and smooth, some have ripples, and some have random, but well-quantified, textures.  Planar targets can also consist of multiple foils separated by gaps of 5 to 200 microns.   Planar targets can be made from a single material, a mixed material, or composites of different materials.  Planar targets can be made from plastics, metals, alloys, low density foams, and/or cryogenically cooled hydrogen and/or deuterium.  Most targets are custom built to precise specifications for dimensions, flatness, shape (including prescribed curvature), thickness, and uniformity.  In some cases the impurities and/or dopants must be controlled and known to less than a tenth of a percent.

<DESC>Contracting Office Address<br />Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 6120 Executive Boulevard, EPS Suite 600, Room 6072, Rockville, MD 20852, UNITED STATES.<br /><br />Description<br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology &amp; Genetics (DCEG), plans to procure on a sole source basis with Active Motif Inc., 1914 Palomar Oaks Way, Suite 150, Carlsbad, CA 92008 to perform chromatin isolation and processing from formaldehyde-fixed PBMC cell pellets as well as chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) from isolated chromatin using H3K27me3 and H3K4me2 specific antibodies to produce ChIP DNAs. <br /><br />This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541690 and the business size standard in $7.0M. <br /><br />Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.
<p>Period of Performance: Performance shall be for three months from date of award.</p>
<p>CDKN2A is a major susceptibility for familial melanoma, but its incomplete penetrance suggests that other factors may modify the effect of this gene in melanoma-prone families. The NCI hypothesizes that the CDKN2A carrier mutation state may be an important factor influencing epigenetic processes in predisposed individuals, and that specific histone patterns in the genome may modify melanoma risk in melanoma-prone families segregating CDKN2A germline mutations.</p>
<p>The objectives of this procurement are to determine whether changes in constitutional histone 3 lysine 27 tri-methylated (H3K27me3) and histone 3 lysine 4 di-methylated (H3K4me2) histone methylation signatures are associated with germline CDKN2A mutation status. This insight may have the potential to identify melanoma-related histone patterns in CDKN2A mutation carriers that could be important for cancer risk and progression.</p>
<p>The contractor shall isolate chromatin from each of 10 formaldehyde-fixed EBV-PBMC cell pellets provided by NCI, fragment chromatin using sonication and carryout nanodrop quantitation and agarose gel electrophoresis analyses, prepare specific H3K27me3 and H3K4me2 chromatin DNAs, and carry out all necessary quality control checks.</p>
<p>The ChIP method has emerged as a very powerful tool to study in vivo histone-DNA interactions. It has been applied to the dynamics of chromatin structure, regulation by transcription factors and identification of changes in histone marks throughout the genome. Active Motif is a high-throughput service provider for preparation and analysis of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) DNAs. For this procurement, Active Motif can provide a complete end-to-end service package for ChIP DNA preparation from fixed cell pellets including all QC checks to ensure successful output for sequence (ChIP-Seq) analysis. Active motif is considered international leading providers in commercial reagents and kits for ChIP together with the provision of in-house chromatin preparation and ChIP DNA analyses services.</p>
<p>Active Motif is the best and only known service provider known that can prepare successful ChIP DNAs from fixed cell pellets for this project. This will provide NCI with the necessary high-quality preparation of chromatin and ChIP DNAs from fixed PBMC cell pellets, and sequently allow the genome-wide mapping of histone marks using sequence analysis at our NCI core facility.</p>
<p>In addition, Active Motif's ChIP protocols offer higher sensitivity and lower non-specific background compared with other ChIP methods in general use today and thus their output or ChIP DNAs result in more informative ChIP-Seq data including the detection of sites containing much lower levels of histone binding. Active Motif also provides optimized QC steps throughout the procedure to monitor chromatin preparation as well as determine if results are due to ChIP or the antibody, and if the ChIP assay has errors. This will ensure the successful preparation of all the ChIP DNAs from each of the 10 cell pellets (from subjects in the 873 melanoma-prone family), which will ensure that the results produced under this procurement will be:</p>
<p>1) Successful and comparable across the different family members and between the two different ChIP analyses (H3K27me3 and H3K4me2); and</p>
<p>2) Will be successfully completed in time for subsequent sequence (ChIP-Seq) analysis and data output by the NCI Sequencing Core Facility, which is vital to the success of this project</p>
<p>Thus, to our knowledge Active Motif is the only company that provides a start-to-finish ChIP-Seq services (including ChIP experimental design and consultation, chromatin preparation, antibody performance and validation, performance of ChIP assays with post-ChIP QC, sequencing, and comprehensive data analysis).</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI Office of Acquisitions on or before 11:00 AM EST on May 11, 2011. No electronic capability statements will be accepted (i.e. email or fax). An original and one copy must be sent to the NCI Office of Acquisitions at the address stated above. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Melissa Ward, Contract Specialist, at wardmr@mail.nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>Unrestricted
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires professional architect and engineering services to support remedial planning and oversight activities in Region 9 which includes California, Nevada, Arizona, Hawaii, Guam, American Samoa, the Territories in the Pacific and Tribal Land.  The services include site management; remedial investigation feasibility studies; engineering services to design remedial actions; engineering evaluation and cost analysis for non-time critical removal actions; construction management for implementing remedial actions and non-time critical removal actions, including issuing and managing subcontracts for construction of the selected remedy and engineering services in overseeing construction; enforcement support, including oversight of remedial investigations/feasibility studies, remedial design and remedial action, and negotiation support; and other technical assistance, including community relations, sampling and analysis support, and pre-design investigations.  Services may include technical and management services supporting EPA's coordination and oversight of remedial actions where they are performed by a state, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, or responsible parties identified in enforcement actions. 

The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 562910 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  At least fifty (50) percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the prime contractor.  
This procurement envisions the award of two (2) Response Action Contract (RAC), one under full and open competition and one small business set-aside.  This announcement pertains to the unrestricted/full and open competition.  The small business set-aside project is issued under a separate announcement.  The contracts will be firm fixed rate, Indefinite Delivery/ Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) award term contracts.  The base period of performance will be three (3) years, with three  award terms periods, two (2) year, three (3) years and two (2) years, for a potential total period of ten (10) years.  Work will be issued by Task Orders.  The total estimated of this proposed contract, including award terms, is $110,000,000.00.  The Government reserves the right to issue multiple awards under either of the procurement announcements, the unrestricted and/or the small business set-aside.
The contract will be awarded in accordance with the Brooks Act Procurement procedures.  For this procurement, EPA requires that the offerors organize the information so as to highlight responses to the technical Evaluation Criteria.  Firms interested in responding to this announcement are invited to submit completed Standard Form 330 (SF 330) to the office shown below by June 29, 2007, 2:00 PM Pacific Time.  Responses must be received at the designated Region 9 location by the deadline; postmarks will not suffice.  Responses to this announcement, including SF 330 and all attachments, shall not exceed fifty (50) pages.  No alterations to the SF 330 are permitted. The response should be single sided, with a minimum of 10 point font, 8.5 X 11 only (no other size page(s) will be allowed).  This page limit does not include the cover letter, the front and back cover of the SF 330, tab/divider pages or the table of contents.  There is no page limitation for any individual section or portion of the SF 330 or attachment(s), the only limitation is the overall page limitation stated above. Offerors shall follow the instructions for completing the SF 330. Offerors whose response exceed the page limitation and do not comply with instruction provide will be non responsive.  Submit one (1) original and seven (7) copies, a total of eight (8), and one (1) electronic copy on disc in the following formats (Word Perfect, MS Word) of  your response to the following address:  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region 9, Contracts Section: Attn: Paul Casagrande MTS-4-3, 75 Hawthorne St., San Francisco, CA 94105.  
	
	There is no prohibition against a firm participating in both the RAC full and open competition and the RAC small set-aside.  All proposals will be evaluated in an identical manner and in accordance with specified evaluation criteria.   The Government does not envision awarding contracts to a respective firm that would be the Prime or Sub-contractor in both the full and open and the set-aside procurements.  Pursuant to FAR 36.6, the source selection official has the latitude to consider selection of another of the ranked offerers.  Rationale for considering such action could be the Governments goal to provide alternate sources for its requirements, including the mitigation and management of conflict of interest (COI) issues.  In the event that firms propose under a joint venture agreement, both firms must demonstrate the ability to implement the requirements of the tasks described in the Statement of Work independently. 

	The EPA Region 9 is not going to hold a pre-proposal conference.  This announcement is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  However, the RFP will be posted shortly on the EPA web site for informational purposes only.  A bidders list will not be provided or posted.  Following EPA's review of the SF 330, a "short list" of the most highly rated firms will be developed.  Short listed firms will be referred to as "selected firms."  Selected firms will be invited to participate in oral presentations.  The specific details on the oral presentations will only be provided to the selected firms.  Selected offerors should be aware that their overall rating depends on both written submissions and their oral presentations.  Following oral presentations, the proposals will then be ranked and the source selection authority will make the final selection from among those firms.  The most highly rated firm will be asked to submit a cost proposal, Conflict of Interest Plan, Quality Management Plan, Representations and Certifications, and Subcontracting Plan.  The contractor will also be required to have an acceptable accounting system that allows for segregation and tracking of costs. 

Selection will be based on the following evaluation criteria which are listed in descending order of importance:

Factor #1 - SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE AND TECHNICAL COMPETENCE (AS PRESENDTED IN SECTION E, G, H, AND PART II OF FIRM?S SF 330)
	Sub-Factor #1	Fund-Lead Site Specific Work Areas

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

(4) Proven plan to procure, and manage eight (8) technically qualified Specialty Sub-contractors listed in the Contract Specifications. The estimated cost range for this project is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. A bid guarantee is required and the offerors must provide evidence that they can provide Performance and Payment Bonds after award.</p>
<p>A pre-proposal conference will be conducted by GSA on Tuesday, May 11, 2011 at 10:00 AM. Contractors shall meet at the Edward T. Gignoux Federal Courthouse, 156 Federal Street, Portland, Maine at 9:30 AM. The Government considers attendance at this conference vital to the preparation of a competitive offer as it will enable the Contractor to become acquainted with the work areas and that it is more advantageous for each Offeror to have qualified representation at the pre-proposal conference. As Offerors may not be able to re-enter buildings after the tour, and cameras are not allowed on federal property, all Offerors are cautioned to see all areas as they deem necessary during the tour, in order to augment their ability to submit an informed proposal. Failure to attend this meeting may not be used as an excuse for omissions or miscalculations in offers. No questions can be answered during the tour therefore; all questions need to be submitted in writing to the contracting officer. While the conference will provide an opportunity to discuss and clarify the solicitation provisions, any information received at the pre-proposal is not official or binding and nothing said or represented in the conference will be deemed to modify the solicitation requirements unless followed by a written amendment.</p>
<p>The solicitation, agreement, specifications, drawings and other applicable documents&nbsp;will be&nbsp;available for electronic download at no charge from the Federal Business Opportunities website at www.fbo.gov on May 11, 2011. No other notifications will be sent. No hard copies of the solicitation will be mailed or issued, and telephone, fax, or email requests for this solicitation will not be accepted. Contract Award is Subject to the Availability of Funds.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Acquisition and Logistics, Contracting Office, Technology Acquisition Center (TAC), located at 260 Industrial Way West, Eatontown, NJ 07724 intends to enter into a contract on a basis of other than full and open competition for the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Office of Research and Development (ORD).  The TAC intends to award a sole source Firm-Fixed-Priced (FFP) contract to Elselvier Inc., 360 Park Avenue South, New York, NY  10010.

This procurement is in support of the VA's Major Initiative, "Perform Research and Development." The purpose of the proposed action is to provide VHA ORD with a portfolio categorization and reporting tool to address VA research reporting issues identified in the VA Office of Inspector General's report, "Review of the Veterans Health Administration's Use of Appropriated Funds for Research."  The VA research program must remain compliant with the uniform federal-wide reporting standard and strategy for Government-funded research.  The baseline standard for this reporting strategy is the National Institute of Health (NIH) Research, Condition, and Disease Categorization (RCDC) library of categories for applicable research projects.  This proposed action is necessary to acquire an enterprise software license of the brand name Elsevier fingerprint engine and customization services for existing modules that will allow VHA ORD to categorize all projects in its research project portfolio using the NIH RCDC category definitions, and effectively compare the VA and NIH research portfolios.  The fingerprint engine is already developed to categorize based on NIH categories and will need additional customization to support VA category definitions.  The analysis and reporting modules that use the fingerprint engine will need to be customized to meet ORD reporting requirements.  This software tool must provide the analytic capability to evaluate the VA's research program for areas of strength, influence, trends, gaps, new opportunities, potential duplication, and comparison with other federal funding institutions.  The software tool will facilitate the peer review process within VA and by NIH by identifying appropriate reviewers given the scope of each research project.  The software tool must also provide a public web-based reporting function. The brand name Elsevier fingerprint engine is the research project categorization technology currently used by the NIH.  This proposed action also includes the associated analysis and reporting modules to support portfolio analysis, peer review, and a public-facing web reporter.  The fingerprint engine contains the category definitions from NIH and VA.  The analysis and reporting modules will be the interface used by VHA ORD.  In addition, Elsevier will provide support services to include installation, integration and customization of the fingerprint engine and system modules based upon VA-specific data and performance requirements.  Ongoing technical support is needed to maintain the fingerprint engine and ensure ongoing consistency with NIH category definitions.   

The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1 entitled, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."  The North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) for this effort is 541519.

This notification shall close on Wednesday, May 4, 2011.  All responsible sources may submit a response which shall be considered by the agency.  Questions/responses shall be submitted via e-mail to Contract Specialist, Kelly McGirr, kelly.mcgirr@va.gov, with the subject line as the synopsis number, VA118-11-RQ-0331.  The Points of Contact (POCs) for this action are Kelly McGirr, Contract Specialist, 732-578-5560 or Kevin Loesch, Contracting Officer, 732-578-5487.

<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Oregon State Office, plans to negotiate a noncompetitive purchase order with Apparatus Equipment & Services, Inc., 2015 Milestone Drive, Suite D, Salt Lake City, UT 84104-6544 for the repair of a "Twin Disk" fully automatic power shift model TD-61-1177 transmission.   This transmission is in a fire engine that was made by American Truck Company (ATC) and is called a TATRA.  The following services will be required: TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:  GENERAL  Repairs needed include:    1) diagnose and determine repairs needed, 2) remove 2500 gallon water tank, plumbing and electrical lines.  Then remove and repair transmission as needed, 3) clean contaminated oil out of cooling system, and 4) re-install transmission, 2,500 gallon water tank, fire truck plumbing, electrical lines by a certified fire apparatus manufacturer mechanic.
SPECIFICATIONS/HISTORY - While working on a fire, the truck blew an oil line and lost fluid that caused the transmission to stop working.  The truck was towed to a shop to be inspected, and the inspection determined that the transmission was out of commission.  The TD-61-1177 transmission is integrated into the chassis backbone tube, eliminating transfer box.  Lockable torque divider front to rear axles are incorporated inside the transmission.  Transmission is connected to the torque converter by a heavy duty drive-shaft.  The whole drive train must be pulled when the transmission is removed. The transmission will have to be pulled and inspected to determine repairs needed.  Because of the metal in the oil, the oil cooling system must be flushed and parts may need to be replaced.
DELIVERY:  The Government will deliver and pickup the truck to the Contractor's site for repairs.
Vendors who possess the capability to perform the named service repairs may submit their qualifications in writing specifically addressing ability to provide the service to the Contracting Officer.  This notice is not a request for competitive quotes.  The Government will consider all responses received by noon May 11, 2011, local time (PST).  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Submittals should include the solicitation number, qualifications, and contact information.  They may be sent by either mail at or facsimile.  Mailing address is Bureau of land Management, Attn:  OR952, P. O. Box 2965, Portland, OR  97208.  Facsimile number is 503-808-6312. E-mail address is or952mb@blm.gov.

<DESC>NOTICE OF SOURCES SOUGHT: This is not a Request for Proposal or Quote, no contract will result from this notice and information obtained is for planning purposes only. The US Forest Service is seeking local commercial companies able to provide services for the mechanical control of competing vegetation on forest lands in and around the McCloud, California area on the Shasta Trinity National Forest. The purpose of this notice is to conduct market research to determine availability of contractors interested in this type of work and to determine the set-aside method for future procurements. No solicitation documents are available at this time.<br /><br />A variety of small vegetation control projects (50-150 acres) are contemplated, such as (1) mechanically creating planting strips by rototilling or mulching existing vegetation in rows to allow conifer seedlings to be planted the following spring, and (2) cultivating soil and competing vegetation within 11 foot strips between rows of recently planted conifer plantations.<br /><br />Competing vegetation generally consists of a variety of regeneration saplings (mainly Lodge Pole Pine), a complex of woody brush, herbaceous plants, grasses and sedges. Rocks, stumps, logs, roots and other obstacles are present, some are not visible. Ground slopes range from flat to 27 degrees.<br /><br />It is anticipated that tractor(s) would wheeled or composite rubber tracked of sufficient size and power to pull appropriate implements and able to comply with all applicable fire and safety laws. The site preparation implement is anticipated to be a tilling type attachment with a rotating shaft capable of chopping and mixing all vegetation and soil to a minimum depth of 6 inches. Within cultivation units it is expected that the tractor and implement will be capable of performing the work without damaging the government's planted trees is such ways as scrapping, crushing, burying, pulling or burning. Cultivators shall have sufficient strength to pull sweeps horizontally through the soil at a depth of not less than 6 inches below the ground line without allowing debris to accumulate under the cultivator.<br /><br />INFORMATION REQUESTED: Contractors interested in these types of projects should submit information about their firm and a short capability statement (2 pages or less) describing available equipment and their knowledge of local area. Firm information shall identify your business size status and if you hold any certifications such as HubZone, 8(a) or Service Disabled, Veteran Owned Small business. The standard for determining small business size is based on&nbsp; the North American Industrial Classification COde (NAICS code 115310) of $7 million average annual receipts. Please submit responses via email to <a href="mailto:dmmorris@fs.fed.us">dmmorris@fs.fed.us</a> by May 5, 2011.<br /><br /><br />

<SUBJECT>SAMPLING EXPANSION OF FISH COMMUNITIES
<SOLNBR>NFFN7600-11-04090SLW
<RESPDATE>050911
<CONTACT>Sharon L. Walker, Phone (816)426-7470, Email sharon.walker@noaa.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Marine Fisheries Service, (NMFS) in Miami, FL , acquires services from the Tavernier Science Center (TSC) of Audubon of Florida for sampling Network Expansion to fish communities of the coastal wetlands of Biscayne Bay. Dr. Jerome Lorenz of TSC has been conducting research in South Florida on coastal fish communities in relation to water and salinity patterns since 1989 and has a dissertation and several scientific papers on the topic. Dr. Lorenz has previously established a network of sampling stations in coastal wetlands of southeastern Florida, developed a sampling protocol, and applied it consistently on a periodic basis beginning in 1990 and gradually expanding. This procurement action will add funds to cover the cost of labor, maintenance, and monitoring at two additional sites not previously covered by NOAA-NMFS. These sites are part of the original established network, and the water quality monitoring equipment and fish sampling structure installed by the National Audubon Society Tavernier Science Center and employed and maintained by them for many years are still in place. Therefore, there will be no cost of NOAA-NMFS for installation of equipment. NOAA-NMFS has been benefiting from the information collected at these sites for many years and needs the information flow from these two sites to continue..
<p>The sampling protocol that is required is unique and particularly applicable to coastal wetlands of south Florida, where sampling and analysis of the samples collected is extremely difficult due to the soft, highly fragile terrain and the fluctuating water levels that affect the estimation of faunal density. Dr. Lorenz's sampling and analytical approach is unique in the following respects: A 3 x 3-m sampling frame is established and maintained at the site and a bottom-weighted dropnet is deployed from a distance by means of a trip wire to obtain a sample. He clears the dropnet to acquire the sample. He has built a boardwalk at the site that is used by the sampler to avoid disturbing the substrate. The substrate consists of a thick, highly flocculent material made up primarily of microalgae complexed with calcium carbonate. At each site, samples are collected in two types of habitat, creek (deep water) and flats (shallow water). At each site, he has established automated data collection equipment with sensors that measure water level and salinity. Data from the data logger can be downloaded remotely at the Tavernier Science Center on a real-time basis. The water-level information is used to help integrate sampling results from creeks and flats. Creek and flats data are analyzed differently, depending upon water level, which determines water depth on the flats and whether the flats are covered with water. Dr. Lorenz has developed a hypsographic curve that allows him to convert his sampling data to biomass density with the use of the water-level information from the recorders and observations made at the time of samplng. Dr. Lorenz is the only known researcher applying this protocol, which is logistically complex and would be difficult to duplicate with the same efficiency and reliability.</p>
<p>The two sites to be supported by NOAA-NMFS funding are part of an established monitoring network. To yield meaningful results, the proposed work must be consistent with past work at these same locations and other work already performed by Dr. Lorenz at Biscayne Bay. The only known source is Dr. Lorenz that can provide the consistent and knowledgeable monitoring approach that is necessary and an intrinsic part of this network. Dr. Lorenz is widely known for the sampling protocol and the new knowledge he has gained on South Florida's coastal wetlands. Dr. Lorenz has the knowledge and skills to apply the necessary protocol in a timely manner and to implement the project quickly.</p>
<p>The National Marine Fisheries Service is obligated to provide sampling results for a System Status Report and a full project report in calendar 2012. Failure to complete this project on schedule would erode the NOAA relationship with other agencies participating in the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration effort and reduce NOAA's prestige in the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration community. Failure to complete the project on schedule could prevent NOAA from providing information to Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan and the Biscayne Bay Coastal Wetlands Project in time for the information to be used. This might jeopardize the ability to define and protect the freshwater needs of southern coastal estuaries and allow their further degradation.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one known source the Tavernier Science Center (TSC) of Audubon of Florida. They are the only known company able to provide the service for the existing government requirement.</p>
<p>Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within ten (10) days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. Interested firms shall include, in writing, the company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, and business size; a statement regarding their detailed capabilities and qualifications to support their ability to provide this service, and any additional supporting literature. Submissions received in response to this notice shall be evaluated based on the technical ability and demonstrated past experience to meet the requirements described in the description section above. Vendor must provide a DUNS number (http://www.dnb.com/us/ ) and register with the Central Contractors Registration (http://www.ccr.gov/ ). Responses should be emailed to sharon.walker@noaa.gov or faxed to 816-274-6983, Attn: Sharon Walker.</p>

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice for seeking market research and information only for a potential name brand purchase.  Quotations are NOT being requested at this time.  The National Park Service seeks to determine the interest of potential Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, Veteran-Owned Small Business, 8(a) Small Business, HUBZone Small Business, Woman Owned Small Business or Small Business Firms for a Larson Davis sound level meter and accessories.  Vendor must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and in Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).  North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334419.  Small business size standard is 500 employees.
Homestead National Monument of America is being assisted by the National Park Service (NPS) Natural Soundscape Program which uses automated sound monitoring instruments for year-round data collection.  The NPS Natural Soundscape Program developed the protocol and the software to analyze the data and ensure that the data is comparable between parks.  Since the program's 2003 beginning, the central component of these systems has been Larson Davis (LD) 824 sound level meters that are being replaced by the LD 831 sound level meters.
Larson Davis developed a substantially improved sound level meter (LD 831) that will advance and improve the Soundscape Program's data collection efforts.  The LD 831 meter uses substantially less power that results in fewer batteries and solar panels to power the systems.  The LD 831 meter collects sound levels and digital recordings that will replace the need for a laptop computer in the system substantially reducing system costs and power requirements while improving the recording quality.  The integrated functions will allow more rapid and less conspicuous deployment.
Items to be purchased are: LD 831-RI sound level meter with Class-1 random-incidence prepolarized condenser microphone, preamplifier, accessory kit, battery, power supply w/ USB cable and windscreen; 831-OB3 Upgrade meter with real-time 1/1 & 1/3 octave filter set; 831-LOG Upgrade to record levels for 24 hr/day; EXC010 microphone extension cable 10', EPS2106-2 Environmental protection for system; DSC003 Pkg of 20 replacement desiccant cartridges; CAL200 Class 1 acoustic calibrtor with user selectable output of 94 or 114 dB.
Existing software compatibility:  The NPS has developed specialize software to process data from both the original LD 824 sound level meter and the LD 831 model.  All sound level meters have unique formatting and data storage requirements.  These essential NPS-developed software programs will not work with other manufacturers' sound level meters and are necessary for data analysis and reporting.  
Hardware and accessories:  The LD 831 sound level meter (SLM) uses numerous accessories (environmental shroud, microphones, preamplifiers, cables, power supply) that are interchangable with both the LD 824 and LD 831 models currently in use within the NPS Soundscape Program.  This makes the integration of an additional LD 831 simple and cost effective.
The LD 831 sound level meter is an important component of the NPS soundscape program and the instrument that will eventually replace all LD 824 sound level meters in the program. 
If you are interested in this request and you are a Larson Davis distributor or a vendor who feels that your product is competitive with the Larson Davis project, submit via email your company name, address, phone number, contact name and Dun & Bradstreet number to Linda_Clarke@nps.gov no later than 05/11/2011.

ATTACHMENT 1 
BACKGROUND: The G-BOSS pre-shot sniper detection system will be used during the day, night and adverse weather operations.  It will be employed in the open terrain and urban environments as an additional method to increase battlefield situational awareness and as a means to rapidly improve detection, accurately identify, locate, and neutralize sniper activities and other precision small arms fire threats.  NAVSURFWARCENDIV Crane is requesting market survey information relative to the maturity and availability of pre-shot sniper activity detection systems for potential incorporation into the U.S.
 Marine Corps Ground-Based Operational Surveillance System (Expeditionary)(G-BOSS(E)) program.  The technology maturity must be at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 per the Department of Defense (DOD) Technology Readiness Assessment (TRA) Desktop Reference dated July 2009 http://www.dod.gov/ddre/doc/DoD_TRA_July_2009_Read_Version.pdf.   In order to be considered a TRL 6, a system/subsystem model or prototype must be demonstrated in a relevant environment.  A relevant environment is a testing environment that simulates both the most important and most stressing aspects of the operational environment.  Sources are requested to provide information in the form of white papers on their existing pre-shot sniper detection technologies.
  This RFI is for pre-shot technologies only that may include: optic retro-reflective methods, SWIR, skin detection, or any other current technology that is capable of detecting and localizing snipers or sniper activity sources is being sought.

<SUBJECT>RFI for No-Cost Partnership Agreement - Geographic Support System

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) as defined in FAR 15.201(e). The Government is requesting information regarding the availability and feasibility of creating a partnership* between the U.S. Census Bureau and a government contractor through a no-cost contract focused on exchanging geographic data commonly used by both partners.
<p>OVERVIEW</p>
<p>The initial improvement of MAF/TIGER location accuracy and related data was completed for all counties and statistically equivalent entities (with the exception of Midway Island) in FY 2008 in preparation for the Census Bureau's 2010 Census. The next goal was to update the inventory of streets, other geographic features and structures through the 2010 Census (FY 2010). This was achieved through the various decennial programs, such as the Address Canvassing operation conducted in 2009, prior to the actual enumeration.</p>
<p>An ongoing Geography Division (GEO) goal is to maintain MTDB information to a specified currency throughout the upcoming decade. When TIGER information is updated with additions and deletions, the MAF information also must be updated concurrently. At critical periods before the selection of the sample for a household survey, or the preparation for a nationwide mailing of questionnaires, MAF/TIGER information must be current to a date specified by the Census Bureau. The goal is that all feature and structure data be no more than one year old or as required. Also, after sample selection or a mailing operation, the goal is to have all living quarters existing as of a given date identified and added to MAF/TIGER. The geographic partnerships with Federal, state, local, and tribal governments must also be maintained as part of the update system put into place.</p>
<p>GEO is currently preparing for a Geographic Support System (GSS) Initiative to support and maintain the geographic and cartographic infrastructure necessary for the Census Bureau's data collection, processing, tabulation, and dissemination programs for the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas.</p>
<p>There are three basic program elements the GSS Initiative supports:</p>
<p>1. Improve Address Coverage<br />2. Continuous Street Feature Updates<br />3. Quality Assessments</p>
<p>The overall goal of the GSS Initiative is to improve the inventory of addresses and roads in support of a targeted address canvassing for the 2020 Census. There is a program mid-lifecycle milestone in 2015 to determine progress toward, and continued feasibility of, this goal in 2015.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this cooperative research project is to create a partnership between the U.S. Census Bureau and a partner through a no-cost contract focused on sharing information (receipt and dissemination of information by each partner) by exchanging geographic data commonly used by both partners. These efforts shall result in the following deliverables: identifying a process of exchange, a beta-test of the process, and a final report summarizing the exercise with recommendations for future actions.</p>
<p>The partnership will reflect the attributes of an open, collaborative, and customer-oriented professional relationship. The expectation of each partner shall be limited to obtaining an increased knowledge in the functional process of sharing geographic information through a specific exchange of data identified as relevant to both partners (i.e. what works as well as what doesn't work in a one-on-one data exchange for update purposes). Neither partner shall enter into the partnership with an expectation of receiving payment or other monetary compensation for services rendered or supplies provided.</p>
<p>SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES</p>
<p>Objective 1: To focus on sharing information including, but not limited to:<br />&bull; The contents of each organization's respective databases<br />&bull; The quality of information in the databases; how does each partner measure/evaluate?<br />&bull; The quality of the sources of the data; what is acceptable quality, how does each partner measure/evaluate?<br />&bull; The coverage of data and data sources<br />&bull; Each organization's knowledge about data collection, sources, feature updating, etc.</p>
<p>Objective 2: To prove-in a potential feature data exchange process by:<br />&bull; Realigning existing roads, if necessary, in either database<br />&bull; Uploading the partner's database roads that do not currently exist in the MTdb into the MTdb and/or uploading MTdb roads that do not currently exist in the partner's database into the partner's database (i.e. identifying new roads and updating the appropriate database).<br />&bull; Work related to this objective would encompass<br />-o Selecting a county with transportation features of varying positional accuracy, some of which exist only in the MTdb and some of which exist only in the partner's database.<br />-o Determining how roads can be matched between databases based on position and attributes.<br />-o Determining the attributes of importance.<br />-o Determining the criteria for identifying which database has the best positional accuracy. Is positional accuracy on the feature level more important than overall positional accuracy?<br />-o Determining whether it is necessary to realign existing roads prior to moving forward with updating new roads.<br />-o Identifying new roads and update appropriate databases.<br />-o All the above will contribute to developing a process to facilitate updating of databases</p>
<p>SUITABILITY FOR PARTICIPATION CRITERIA:</p>
<p>The U.S. Census bureau is interested in receiving responses to this RFI from contractor companies (businesses) that meet the following suitability criteria for this partnership:</p>
<p><br />1. Continuously update, maintain and create products from a nationwide geospatial database that is used in a commercial capacity. At a minimum the database must contain linear features that represent all street features within the United States. Ideally, the database contains other linear and aerial features such as railroads, hydrography and legal boundaries.</p>
<p><br />2. Possess well established quality assurance and quality control processes to ensure that the quality of the data in the database maintained. This includes processes to validate/verify that data going into, contained within, and coming out of the database adhere to established quality standards for both accuracy and completeness.</p>
<p><br />3. Have demonstrated experience with utilizing geospatial data from multiple sources (of varying spatial accuracy, and in multiple formats) to update the features within the database via automated or semi-automated processes. This includes updating the spatial location and attribute data for existing features, as well as the addition of new features they did not previously exist.</p>
<p>INFORMATION REQUESTED<br />Respondents are instructed to provide capability statements that detail how their businesses meet the Suitability for Participation Criteria listed in the prior section of this RFI.</p>
<p><br />In addition, the following information should be provided in response to this RFI:<br />&bull; Name and Address of the Organization;<br />&bull; Point of contact, including name, title, telephone number, and e-mail address;<br />&bull; Brief description of the organization, business size, ownership, and services provided.<br />&bull; DUNS number and NAICS codes under which services are provided.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>Place of Performance<br />While the majority of the work can be conducted via email and teleconference, some site visits (to Census Bureau Headquarters or to partner's place of work) will be required.</p>
<p>Period of Performance<br />The Period of Performance for this project will not exceed nine (9) months from the start of the cooperative effort.</p>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMISSIONS<br />Submissions shall be created using Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF formats with font size no smaller than 12-point pitch. Text shall be presented on 8 &frac12; x 11-inch paper with 1-inch margins. Submitters are asked to limit their responses to no more than 20 pages. Response to this RFI shall be submitted via e-mail to fermaint.rios@census.gov no later than May 12, 2011 by 2:00 PM EST.</p>
<p>*Within the context of this document, the use of the terms "Partner" and "Partnership" is defined as a contractual agreement between the U.S. Census Bureau and a non-governmental entity to collaborate, share and exchange information for the purpose of achieving the objectives stated herein. No other meaning should be inferred.</p>

<DESC>&#61656; SCOPE
<p>A training need exists at USCG Marine Safety Unit (MSU) Port Arthur, on cargo control operations for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) vessel. The use of a simulator that reflects the current cargo control room arrangements, displays and operation is needed to enhance the professional development of this unit's LNG Port State Control Boarding Officers. Training required for four Port State Control Boarding Officers.</p>
<p>&#61656; BACKGROUND</p>
<p>MSU Port Arthur has two LNG terminals with the addition of other cryogenic cargo loading docks within our area of responsibility. The Unit's Boarding Officers are responsible for conducting Port State Control (PSC) examinations on Foreign Flag LNG tankers that visit the port on a frequent basis. Many of these highly sophisticated LNG tankers are making their 1st visit to US waters and have a fully automated cargo system that require familiarization to understand different aspects of the loading/unloading process and safety systems. It is the responsibility of our PSC Boarding Officer to assure cargo operations are safe and that the vessel meets both International Conventions and US regulations.</p>
<p>The LNG tank vessels that discharge and load cargo in this unit's AOR are foreign flag. They are built to International and various Classification standards. It is important that this unit's Boarding Officers have an understanding of these standards and that Recognized classification societies have reviewed and certified the requested course of training. We do not need a course focused on only US vessel cargo operations.</p>
<p><br />&#61656; REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>&bull; Training to be specific to Liquefied Natural Gas ( LNG), <br />Shipboard cargo control operations.</p>
<p>&bull; The training provided to cover in detail the follow items:<br />o Display of cargo temperature.<br />o Display of cargo level.<br />o Display of gas detection.<br />o Display of tank pressure.<br />o Method of controlling cargo temperature.<br />o Method of controlling Cargo level.<br />o Method of controlling tank pressure.<br />o Method of controlling the explosive atmosphere within the cargo tank and surrounding area.<br />o Method of providing inert gas.</p>
<p>&bull; Cargo operations to include:<br />o Sequence of cargo operations.<br />o Cargo transfer procedures.<br />o Automatic quick closing cargo manifold valve operations.<br />o Cargo system cool down procedures.<br />o Ballast operation.<br />o Automated cargo operations.<br />o Re-liquefaction systems.<br />o Cargo pumps<br />o Cargo compressors.<br />o Heat exchangers.<br />o Cargo boil off procedures.<br />o Cargo spill procedures.<br />o Cargo fire fighting procedures.</p>
<p>&bull; Training to be recognized by the International Gas Tanker and Terminal Operators (SIGTTO).<br />&bull; Training to be recognized by members of the International association of classification societies (IACS).<br />&bull; Training to cover programs that are being used on the newest LNG tank vessels.</p>

 Introduction:
This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  The purpose of this RFI is to identify qualified GSA Schedule contractors who are able to meet VA's requirements, understand GSA Schedule pricing and discount practices and other market information readily available.  

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is seeking interested sources (contractors) for a near-future solicitation and procurement for user experience program support Services.  At this time, no solicitation exists.  Therefore, DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION.  

 Background: 
The Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) is undertaking a significant effort to improve the effectiveness and performance of the VA's Human Resources functions.  The Human Capital Investment Plan (HCIP) is a human resource management transformational initiative to develop DVA's workforce.  This initiative includes a focus on investing in people development such as leadership training, and supporting and developing the capabilities of SES employees.  As part of the VA's HCIP, CSEMO is initiating a number of projects that are part of an enterprise-wide transformational initiative designed to develop the VA's human capital into a proactive, forward looking, and professional workforce that will provide improved service to Veterans in the 21st century.  CSEMO is charged to develop and staff a comprehensive and efficient talent management system to best recruit, develop, deploy, and support executives across the Department to achieve VA's missions and support its transformational initiatives:  process analysis and improvement of VA's executive life cycle management.  The talent management will support the reengineering and streamlining of paper processes and procedures into automated systems improving efficiencies and effectiveness. The CSEMO is partnering with the Healthcare Talent Management (HTM) office as it also supports programs, services, products and projects that are a vital component of DVA's human capital plans, strategies and programs.  The HTM office has an employee data warehouse that supports human resource functions across the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA).  The HTM office built the Leadership and Workforce Development system, and creates and maintains national applications integrated with this system.  This system is supported by HTM Knowledge Management (KM) personnel who will complete all information technology aspects of the new Senior Executive (SE) Talent Management System (TMS) implementation  The employee data warehouse requires customization to support this vision of workforce development and succession planning principles within the CSEMO.  The end product will be a model flexible enough to scale to other entities; through professional development of key staff, review of internal CSEMO policies and procedures, improving customer satisfaction with services and processes provided by HR and utilizing the existing HTM Project Management Body of Knowledge to manage project scope, schedule, and budget for the SES TMS.  The CSEMO and HTM offices are requesting guidance and expertise from a contractor with experience in large scale human resource transition in a government setting.  The expectation is that the contractor will have experience with a government entity similar in size, complexity and scope as the DVA.  The purpose of this solicitation is to seek knowledge, expertise, training and consultative services to guide the HTM office in the creation, administration and implementation of the DVA's SES TMS.

The CSEMO and HTM offices need assistance in creating several major SE TMS modules.  The modules shall:

"	Identify duties, responsibilities, operational characteristics, and selective placement factors of each executive position.
"	Provide real-time snapshots of VA's senior bench strength and senior executive demographics.  In other words, create a comprehensive organizational interface to project executive personnel and position data for workforce and succession planning;.
"	Provide visibility to trends, gaps, and opportunities across the leadership pool;
"	Track training of executives;
"	Create Individual Development Plans (IDP) for senior executive positions that outline position specific skills, leadership core competencies, and align with assessment tools and core business acumen proficiencies;
"	Track the SES nomination process and generate statistical data and performance metrics;

The technical architecture of the SE TMS shall allow for integration.  All SE TMS data is intended to support the overall management of the DVA's executive talent.

The employee data warehouse is currently online supporting the DVA.  The data warehouse is being used to sustain a multitude of national applications that extend across DVA's organizational entities.  Contract consultative service is needed to guide the CSEMO and HTM offices in the customization of the data warehouse to support the execution of an enterprise-wide SE TMS solution that will align with the Human Capital Investment Plan (HCIP).

CSEMO will employ leadership and workforce development and succession planning principles within the Office, with the intent to have a model flexible enough to scale to other entities, through professional development of key staff, review of internal CSEMO policies and procedures, improving customer satisfaction with services and processes provided by HR and utilizing the HTM existing Project Management Body of Knowledge to manage project scope, timelines and completion, and cost for the SES TMS.  CSEMO is the primary stakeholder of the SES TMS.

The expected return for making this commitment will be enhanced usage of program and project resources, improved monitoring and forecasting of the SES succession pipeline, managing training and development at the SES level, and conformance to quality requirements, while ensuring continued improvement of customer satisfaction.

<DESC>Request for Proposal (RFP) W52P1J-11-R-0063 is for the operation, maintenance, and modernization of Lake City Army Ammunition Plant (LCAAP) and companion small caliber rifle ammunition.  LCAAP is located in Independence, MO, and is a Government-owned, Contractor-operated (GOCO) facility for the manufacture, delivery and related services of small caliber rifle ammunition, such as: 5.56mm; 7.62mm; Cal .50; Cal .30, and, Cal .22 in various packaging configurations.  In consideration for exclusive use of the facilities, the operating contractor will provide facilities support (direct and indirect) in accordance with performance work statements (PWSs).  <br><br>This acquisition will be a best value source selection with full and open competition resulting in two contracts, a Facilities contract and a Production contract.  The Production contract will contain a hybrid of Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) and Requirements Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs).  The IDIQ CLINs will be for the following cartridges which are currently being competed under the small caliber second source acquisition: DODICs A059 (5.56mm M855 Ball, 10-Round Clip), A062 (5.56mm M855 Ball with M27 link (SAW)), A064 (5.56mm (4) M855 Ball: (1) M856 Tracer with M27 link), A080 (5.56mm M200 Blank, 20-Round Carton), AA33 (5.56mm M855 Ball, 10-Round Clip), AB56 (5.56mm M855A1 Ball, linked), AB57 (5.56mm M855A1 Ball, 10-Round Clip), AB58 (5.56mm M855A1 Ball, 10-Round Clip), A131 (7.62mm (4) M80 Ball: (1) M62 Tracer with M13 link), A143 (7.62mm M80 Ball with M13 link), A555 (.50 Cal M33 Ball, linked), and A557 (.50 Cal (4) M33 Ball: (1) M17 Tracer, linked).  The Requirements CLINS will include all 5.56mm, 7.62mm, Cal .50, Cal .30 and Cal .22 families of rifle ammunition awarded by the Army Contracting Command - Rock Island (ACC-RI) with the exception of the items covered by the aforementioned IDIQ CLINs, as well as pistol ammunition (9mm M882, .45 caliber, .38 caliber, etc.), shotgun ammunition (10- and 12-gauge shot shells, etc.), and .300 Winchester Magnum.  The Government reserves the right not to award any item(s) introduced during the contract which LCAAP does not have the current capability to produce or cannot produce without facilitization (perishable tooling excluded).  Firm Fixed Price (FFP) delivery orders and delivery order modifications will be utilized to place requirements for small caliber rifle ammunition on the resulting production contract (for both Requirement and IDIQ CLINs).  Award quantities will vary given funding requirements.<br><br>The resultant contracts will have a base period of five years (FY13 - FY17) and two options for a two-year and three-year period (for FY18- FY19 and FY20-FY22 respectively).  Anticipated award date is 1 October 2012.  <br><br>Technical Data Packages (TDPs) for this effort will be available electronically on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO); CD-ROMs will not be available.

<DESC>The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has a requirement for maintenance renewal of software licenses for a suite of software by Computer Application Services, Inc. (CASI). The suite of software (JES2FTP and RTP) provides reports generated on the mainframe and converts the business reports to PDF (Portable Document Format) which can be viewed by Windows users with ADOBE Acrobat Reader. OPM intends to issue a non-competitive award that will result in a contract to CASI, for a period of one year. CASI is the manufacturer of the software products and is the only known license vendor authorized to sell and provide maintenance for this suite of software. This requirement is conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12, Commercial Items. The authority for this award is FAR 13.106(b), soliciting from a single source; Purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available.
<p>All parties interested in this procurement must submit a capability statement within three calendar days from the date of this notice. Submissions after that date will not be considered. No solicitation will be issued, therefore, any requests for the solicitation will not be considered. Interested parties wishing to submit their questions, interest, and capabilities must do so in writing via email. Oral and facsimile requests for information will not be considered. Verification of receipt of electronic transmission is the sole responsibility of the contractor. A determination not to compete this action based upon responses received is at the sole discretion of the Government. Central Contractor Registration (CCR) is required prior to execution of award. A detailed capability statement must be submitted to Sher&oacute;n Spann at sheron.spann@opm.gov.</p>

<SUBJECT>Satellite Based Broadband Communications Services
<SOLNBR>NSF_SATCOM_RFI_2011
<RESPDATE>061011
<ARCHDATE>08312011
<CONTACT>Pamela Franzel, Contracting Officer, Email pfranzel@nsf.gov
<DESC>W.L. Pritchard &amp; Co., L.C. (WLPCO) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) as a means of conducting market research to identify industry recommendations for means to obtain satellite-based broadband communications services between the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station located at the geographic South Pole (90&deg;S latitude) and the continental United States.
<p>WLPCO presently provides support to the National Science Foundation (NSF), an Executive Branch independent agency of the United States Government. On behalf of the NSF, WLPCO is seeking information on approaches to meet the Government's long term broadband communications needs anticipated for U.S. Antarctic Program science research and mission operations conducted at or near Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station during the 2017-2030+ time frame.</p>
<p>NSF will use information received as part of its strategic planning efforts to identify and characterize a range of communication services options for supporting U.S. activities in Antarctica.</p>
<p>Of particular interest are commercial approaches that would allow the NSF to enter into a long term lease of communications services from a service provider. Approaches that leverage other prospective government and/or private sector interests to buttress a business case for construction/launch of new resources are also of interest.</p>
<p>This RFI provides a broad statement of the Government's needs and seeks industry suggested approaches to satisfy those needs and provide insight into the associated technology and risk.</p>
<p>Responses to this RFI will be treated as information only and will be considered as part of the Government's market research efforts.</p>
<p>Background:<br />The National Science Foundation funds and manages the U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP). Refer to http://www.nsf.gov/od/opp/sitemap.jsp for information on the Office of Polar Programs, and http://www.nsf.gov/od/opp/support/stations.jsp for information on research stations in Antarctica. Refer to http://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/livingsouthpole/station_new.jsp for information on South Pole Station.</p>
<p>Description of Services:<br />South Pole Station is the only NSF research station in Antarctica that cannot be served by conventional North-South station-kept geostationary satellites. It is beyond the coverage of geostationary satellites with less than nine degrees inclination. The station currently accesses GOES-3 (launched in 1978), and NASA TDRS F4, F5 and F6. Given the orbit characteristics of these satellites, communications capability at present is not full-time. The station also uses Iridium service to provide thin network coverage during daily gaps in broadband services provided by GOES and TDRS. Additional information about current South Pole Station satellite communications may be found here: http://www.usap.gov/usapgov/technology/contentHandler.cfm?id=1935</p>
<p>A summary of NSF communications mission needs in support of USAP operations can be found in the file "Attachment 1 - USAP Satellite Communications Mission Needs." This document summarizes the full scope of anticipated communications across the entire Antarctic region, segregated by geographic regions of interest. Each region is given a relative ranking to discriminate in the relative level of emphasis. This depiction is provided to assist communications planners with evaluating the potential for a single space-based solution meeting a broader suite of mission needs than South Pole only, while providing a basis for making trade-offs in capability v. cost and complexity. However, approaches that do not provide some South Pole service are not of direct interest.</p>
<p>Information Requested:<br />To maximize the Government's understanding, respondents should consider the information requested in the list appended to this RFI, titled "Attachment 2 - South Pole Broadband RFI Information Needs."</p>
<p>Submission of Responses:<br />Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI in Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, Power Point)&reg; as the preferred format. RFI responses are limited to a maximum of 20 pages, including cover and administrative pages. Responses may contain a mixture of text, numerical data, figures or graphics. CD-ROM submissions are requested in lieu of printed materials.</p>
<p>Responses are to be submitted to W.L. Pritchard &amp; Co. L.C. at the address noted below.<br /><br />Management of Information:<br />Submissions that voluntarily contain proprietary information will be managed in accord with FAR 9.505-4, "Obtaining access to proprietary information".</p>
<p>Any proprietary information submitted in response to this RFI must be clearly identified via a general declaration on the cover page and on any subsequent page where proprietary information occurs. The Government intends to utilize contractor resources to prepare analytical studies and digests utilizing submissions to the RFI for future planning efforts. Respondents who will require a Proprietary Data Protection Agreement (PDPA) should submit a draft of the necessary permissions protocol prior to submitting any proprietary information. The PDPA will not be counted towards the maximum RFI page count. Any information submitted that is not protected via PDPA shall be subject to full disclosure/release.</p>
<p>Please be advised that submissions will not be returned.</p>
<p>The support contractors listed below will be reviewing responses to this RFI. It is the respondent's responsibility to execute PDPA with these support contractors, if deemed necessary, by the date of your submission. All correspondence regarding the execution of a PDPA must be directed to the support contractors below. Note that the PDPA must allow the contractors to report to NSF.</p>

<DESC>Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition
Identifications: National Park Service, Yellowstone National Park
Description of the action: This action is for the required replacement of internet credit card transaction processing modems, at park entrance stations, due to change in the credit card processing platform that requires replacement of existing equipment.	 	 Description of supplies and services:  Yellowstone has 5 entrance stations that need modem replacement due to the following:  Fifth Third Bank (current contract credit card processor) has notified us that our entrance station Datacap credit card processing locations are accessing a legacy SSL/TLS platform which will no longer be supported beyond August 1, 2011.  Datacap built their product with a hardcoded SSL/TLS URL, which does not allow for changes by the user.  Datacap has informed us that they will not change the hard coded URL. The only alternative to not paying the upgrade fee or purchasing replacement devices is to go back to dial up which would significantly slow credit card transaction processing time at the entrance stations. 
The new modems and associated programming must interface with our existing Comm 2000 POS software and function with existing Datasym Merlin 6670 cash registers which are proprietary products of Intermountain Cash Register, they cannot be purchased on the open market.  Intermountain Cash Register is a licensed Datasym dealer and the closest dealer to Yellowstone in this region. 
Authority:
41 U.S.C.253(c)(1): Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.FAR Part 11.105: The Brand Name products are essential to the Government's requirements, and market research indicates other companies' similar products do not meet and cannot be modified to meet the agency's needs.FAR 13.106(b):  For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand name or industrial mobilization).
Reason for authority cited: This is a very specific modem upgrade to support credit card processing at park entrance stations.
Other facts supporting other than full & open competition: Fifth Third Bank (current contract credit card processor) has notified us that our entrance station Datacap credit card processing locations are accessing a legacy SSL/TLS platform which will no longer be supported beyond August 1, 2011.  Datacap built their product with a hardcoded SSL/TLS URL, which does not allow for changes by the user.  Datacap has informed us that they will not change the hard coded URL. The only alternative to not paying the upgrade fee or purchasing replacement devices is to go back to dial up which would significantly slow credit card transaction processing time at the entrance stations. 
The new modems and associated programming must interface with our existing Comm 2000 POS software and function with existing Datasym Merlin 6670 cash registers which are proprietary products of Intermountain Cash Register, they cannot be purchased on the open market.  Intermountain Cash Register is a licensed Datasym dealer and the closest dealer to Yellowstone in this region.

<DESC>This is a SPECIAL NOTICE. No proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis. The US Army, Corps of Engineers - Mobile District, is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLA) for large scale construction projects (exceeding $40,000,000) within the city of Homestead, FL and surrounding areas. A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy: (a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects. (b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will (1) Advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and (2) Be consistent with law. Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.<br><br>The construction community is requested to respond to this Special Notice with the following information: <br><br>(1) Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts in the city of Homestead, FL and surrounding areas?<br>(2) Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor?<br>(3) Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?<br>(4) What type of project should not be considered for PLA clauses?<br>(5) What is the time impact to the completion of the contract due to a PLA?<br>(6) What is the cost impact to the bid due to a PLA?<br>(7) What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a<br>Mobile Engineer District contract?<br><br>Interested Offerors shall respond to this Special Notice no later than 09 May 2011 via electronic mail to Mr. Brett A.

<p>The contractor shall provide a quote that shall include the following:</p>
<p>Price. All interested offerors must complete the Pricing Schedule tab of the Attachment.

 VA INFORMATION AND INFORMATION SYSTEM SECURITY/PRIVACY LANGUAGE 
1. GENERAL
Contractors, contractor personnel, subcontractors, and subcontractor personnel shall be subject to the same Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks as VA and VA personnel regarding information and information system security.
2. ACCESS TO VA INFORMATION AND VA INFORMATION SYSTEMS
     a. A contractor/subcontractor shall request logical (technical) or physical access to VA information and VA information systems for their employees, subcontractors, and affiliates only to the extent necessary to perform the services specified in the contract, agreement, or task order.
     b. All contractors, subcontractors, and third-party servicers and associates working with VA information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of VA appointees or employees who have access to the same types of information. The level and process of background security investigations for contractors must be in accordance with VA Directive and Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program. The Office for Operations, Security, and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures.
     c. Custom software development and outsourced operations must be located in the U.S. to the maximum extent practical. If such services are proposed to be performed abroad and are not disallowed by other VA policy or mandates, the contractor/subcontractor must state where all non-U.S. services are provided and detail a security plan, deemed to be acceptable by VA, specifically to address mitigation of the resulting problems of communication, control, data protection, and so forth. Location within the U.S. may be an evaluation factor.
     d. The contractor or subcontractor must notify the Contracting Officer immediately when an employee working on a VA system or with access to VA information is reassigned or leaves the contractor or subcontractor's employ. The Contracting Officer must also be notified immediately by the contractor or subcontractor prior to an unfriendly termination.
3. VA INFORMATION CUSTODIAL LANGUAGE
     a. Information made available to the contractor or subcontractor by VA for the performance or administration of this contract or information developed by the contractor/subcontractor in performance or administration of the contract shall be used only for those purposes and shall not be used in any other way without the prior written agreement of the VA. This clause expressly limits the contractor/subcontractor's rights to use data as described in Rights in Data - General, FAR 52.227-14(d) (1).     b. VA information should not be co-mingled, if possible, with any other data on the contractors/subcontractor's information systems or media storage systems in order to ensure VA requirements related to data protection and media sanitization can be met. If co-mingling must be allowed to meet the requirements of the business need, the contractor must ensure that VA's information is returned to the VA or destroyed in accordance with VA's sanitization requirements. VA reserves the right to conduct on site inspections of contractor and subcontractor IT resources to ensure data security controls, separation of data and job duties, and destruction/media sanitization procedures are in compliance with VA directive requirements.
     c. Prior to termination or completion of this contract, contractor/subcontractor must not destroy information received from VA, or gathered/created by the contractor in the course of performing this contract without prior written approval by the VA. Any data destruction done on behalf of VA by a contractor/subcontractor must be done in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requirements as outlined in VA Directive 6300, Records and Information Management and its Handbook 6300.1 Records Management Procedures, applicable VA Records Control Schedules, and VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization. Self-certification by the contractor that the data destruction requirements above have been met must be sent to the VA Contracting Officer within 30 days of termination of the contract. 
     d. The contractor/subcontractor must receive, gather, store, back up, maintain, use, disclose and dispose of VA information only in compliance with the terms of the contract and applicable Federal and VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies. If Federal or VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies become applicable to the VA information or information systems after execution of the contract, or if NIST issues or updates applicable FIPS or Special Publications (SP) after execution of this contract, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to implement the information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies in this contract.     
     e. The contractor/subcontractor shall not make copies of VA information except as authorized and necessary to perform the terms of the agreement or to preserve electronic information stored on contractor/subcontractor electronic storage media for restoration in case any electronic equipment or data used by the contractor/subcontractor needs to be restored to an operating state. If copies are made for restoration purposes, after the restoration is complete, the copies must be appropriately destroyed.
     f. If VA determines that the contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality, privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold payment to the contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12.
     g. If a VHA contract is terminated for cause, the associated BAA must also be terminated and appropriate actions taken in accordance with VHA Handbook 1600.01, Business Associate Agreements. Absent an agreement to use or disclose protected health information, there is no business associate relationship.
     h. The contractor/subcontractor must store, transport, or transmit VA sensitive information in an encrypted form, using VA-approved encryption tools that are, at a minimum, FIPS 140-2 validated.
     i. The contractor/subcontractor's firewall and Web services security controls, if applicable, shall meet or exceed VA's minimum requirements. VA Configuration Guidelines are available upon request.
     j. Except for uses and disclosures of VA information authorized by this contract for performance of the contract, the contractor/subcontractor may use and disclose VA information only in two other situations: (i) in response to a qualifying order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) with VA's prior written approval. The contractor/subcontractor must refer all requests for, demands for production of, or inquiries about, VA information and information systems to the VA contracting officer for response.
     k. Notwithstanding the provision above, the contractor/subcontractor shall not release VA records protected by Title 38 U.S.C. 5705, confidentiality of medical quality assurance records and/or Title 38 U.S.C. 7332, confidentiality of certain health records pertaining to drug addiction, sickle cell anemia, alcoholism or alcohol abuse, or infection with human immunodeficiency virus. If the contractor/subcontractor is in receipt of a court order or other requests for the above mentioned information, that contractor/subcontractor shall immediately refer such court orders or other requests to the VA contracting officer for response.
4. SECURITY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION
     a. The term "security incident" means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures. The contractor/subcontractor shall immediately notify the COTR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor/subcontractor has access.
     b. To the extent known by the contractor/subcontractor, the contractor/subcontractor's notice to VA shall identify the information involved, the circumstances surrounding the incident (including to whom, how, when, and where the VA information or assets were placed at risk or compromised), and any other information that the contractor/subcontractor considers relevant.
     c. In instances of theft or break-in or other criminal activity, the contractor/subcontractor must concurrently report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement entity (or entities) of jurisdiction, including the VA OIG and Security and Law Enforcement. The contractor, its employees, and its subcontractors and their employees shall cooperate with VA and any law enforcement authority responsible for the investigation and prosecution of any possible criminal law violation(s) associated with any incident. The contractor/subcontractor shall cooperate with VA in any civil litigation to recover VA information, obtain monetary or other compensation from a third party for damages arising from any incident, or obtain injunctive relief against any third party arising from, or related to, the incident.

5. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR DATA BREACH
     a. Consistent with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 5725, a contract may require access to sensitive personal information. If so, the contractor is liable to VA for liquidated damages in the event of a data breach or privacy incident involving any SPI the contractor/subcontractor processes or maintains under this contract.
     b. The contractor/subcontractor shall provide notice to VA of a "security incident" as set forth in the Security Incident Investigation section above. Upon such notification, VA must secure from a non-Department entity or the VA Office of Inspector General an independent risk analysis of the data breach to determine the level of risk associated with the data breach for the potential misuse of any sensitive personal information involved in the data breach. The term 'data breach' means the loss, theft, or other unauthorized access, or any access other than that incidental to the scope of employment, to data containing sensitive personal information, in electronic or printed form, that results in the potential compromise of the confidentiality or integrity of the data. Contractor shall fully cooperate with the entity performing the risk analysis. Failure to cooperate may be deemed a material breach and grounds for contract termination.
     c. Each risk analysis shall address all relevant information concerning the data breach, including the following:
    (1) Nature of the event (loss, theft, unauthorized access);
    (2) Description of the event, including:
     (a) date of occurrence;
     (b) data elements involved, including any PII, such as full name, social security number, date of birth, home address, account number, disability code;
    (3) Number of individuals affected or potentially affected;
    (4) Names of individuals or groups affected or potentially affected;
    (5) Ease of logical data access to the lost, stolen or improperly accessed data in light of the degree of protection for the data, e.g., unencrypted, plain text;
    (6) Amount of time the data has been out of VA control;
    (7) The likelihood that the sensitive personal information will or has been compromised (made accessible to and usable by unauthorized persons);
    (8) Known misuses of data containing sensitive personal information, if any;
    (9) Assessment of the potential harm to the affected individuals;

    (10) Data breach analysis as outlined in 6500.2 Handbook, Management of Security and Privacy Incidents, as appropriate; and
    (11) Whether credit protection services may assist record subjects in avoiding or mitigating the results of identity theft based on the sensitive personal information that may have been compromised.
     d. Based on the determinations of the independent risk analysis, the contractor shall be responsible for paying to the VA liquidated damages in the amount of $______ per affected individual to cover the cost of providing credit protection services to affected individuals consisting of the following:
    (1) Notification;
    (2) One year of credit monitoring services consisting of automatic daily monitoring of at least 3 relevant credit bureau reports;
    (3) Data breach analysis;
    (4) Fraud resolution services, including writing dispute letters, initiating fraud alerts and credit freezes, to assist affected individuals to bring matters to resolution;
    (5) One year of identity theft insurance with $20,000.00 coverage at $0 deductible; and
    (6) Necessary legal expenses the subjects may incur to repair falsified or damaged credit records, histories, or financial affairs.
6. SECURITY CONTROLS COMPLIANCE TESTING
On a periodic basis, VA, including the Office of Inspector General, reserves the right to evaluate any or all of the security controls and privacy practices implemented by the contractor under the clauses contained within the contract. With 10 working-day's notice, at the request of the government, the contractor must fully cooperate and assist in a government-sponsored security controls assessment at each location wherein VA information is processed or stored, or information systems are developed, operated, maintained, or used on behalf of VA, including those initiated by the Office of Inspector General. The government may conduct a security control assessment on shorter notice (to include unannounced assessments) as determined by VA in the event of a security incident or at any other time.

<p>17.0 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST</p>
<p>Purpose: The purpose of this article is to ensure that the Contractor (1) is not biased because of its financial, contractual, organizational, or other interest which relate to the work under this Agreement, and (2) does not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of its performance of this Agreement.</p>
<p>Scope: The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the Consultant and any of its affiliates or their successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "Contractor") in activities covered by this article as a prime contractor, subcontractor, cosponsor, joint venture, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this article, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.</p>
<p>"Organizational conflict of interest" means that because of other activities or relationships with other persons, a person is unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the Government, or the person's objectivity in performing the contract work is or might be otherwise impaired, or a person has an unfair competitive advantage (FAR 9.501).</p>
<p>An organizational conflict of interest may result when factors create an actual or potential conflict of interest on an instant contract, or when the nature of the work to be performed on the instant contract creates an actual or potential conflict of interest on a future acquisition (FAR 9.502(c)).</p>
<p>Because of the unusual nature of the work performed under this Agreement, and the fact that the Consultant will have access from time to time to sensitive Government information, and because some of the work will be performed in Government facilities, the Government must maintain a special, close relationship with the Consultant in various important areas.</p>
<p>The Consultant shall not use this privileged information or access to facilities to compete with the private sector.</p>
<p>The Consultant is required to conduct its business in a manner befitting its special relationship with the Government, to operate in the public interest with objectivity and independence, to be free from organizational conflicts of interest, and to have full disclosure of its affairs to the sponsoring agency.</p>
<p>If, under this Agreement, the Consultant prepares a complete or essentially complete statement of work or specifications to be used in competitive acquisitions, the Consultant shall be ineligible to perform or participate in any capacity in any contractual effort that is based on such statement of work or specifications. The Consultant shall not incorporate its products or services in such statement of work or specifications unless approved in writing by the Contracting Officer, in which case the restriction in this subparagraph shall not apply.</p>
<p>It is imperative that the Consultant be proactive in order to avoid organizational conflicts of interest. The Consultant shall take all reasonable measures to assure that organizational conflicts of interest do not occur. As part of the Consultant's efforts to avoid organizational conflict of interest situations, the Consultant shall inform the Government of any actual, potential, or apparent conflicts of interest. The Consultant is responsible for providing a detailed written report of actual, potential, or apparent organizational conflicts of interest to the Contracting Officer as soon as the circumstance is known, describing the conflict and how the Consultant plans to resolve the problem.</p>
<p>Subcontracts: The Consultant shall include an article, substantially similar to this article, in subcontracts involving the performance of advisory and assistance services as that term is defined at FAR 37.201. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "contracting officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.</p>
<p>18.0 REFERENCE TO ATTACHMENTS</p>
<p>The successful offeror will be required to submit the following information upon award:</p>
<p>&bull; Commitment to Protect Non-Public Information - Contractor Employee Agreement<br />&bull; Contractor Employee Separation Checklist</p>
<p>19.0 TECHNICAL EVALUATION FACTOR</p>
<p>Technical factors are of paramount consideration in the award of the task order; however, price is also important to the overall award decision. All evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are significantly more important than price. The Government can make tradeoffs among price and technical factors in determining which Quoter offers the best value by awarding to other than the lowest price Quoter or other than the highest technically rated Quoter. Quoters are advised that award will be made to that Quoter whose quote provides the best overall value to the Government.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA<br />In determining which quote represents the best value and results in the lowest overall price alternative (considering price, special features, administrative costs, etc.) to meet the Government's needs, the Government shall evaluate quotes using the following technical evaluation criteria, which are listed in the order of relative importance with weights assigned for evaluation purposes:</p>
<p>1. Personnel/Staff Qualifications (50 Points)<br />Demonstrated senior-level subject matter expert knowledge and experience of the contractor's project manager in providing intricate logistical support, knowledge of the art of charitable fundraising, and an adept understanding of conducting a fundraising campaign in a Federal agency. Demonstrated knowledge and experience in coordinating a fundraising campaign in a Federal agency having a biomedical research environment such as the National Institutes of Health will be most desirable.</p>
<p>2. Organizational Capabilities, Experience and Commitment (30 Points)<br />Corporate capabilities and past performance in accomplishing similar Federal fundraising projects of comparable magnitude.</p>
<p>3. Understanding the Requirements/Technical Approach (20 Points)<br />Technical and management approach describing how the contractor proposes to plan, manage, control and provide the support services specified in the Statement of Work.</p>

It is imperative that the completed, serviced unit is a completely compatible and similar unit to the existing item, for considerations of efficiency and consistency in data collection, operating procedures, and lab analysis. PGT is the only known manufacturer to offer a complete thru-hole configuration crystal.  Duration of purchase order:  Date of Award 5/15/11 (est) with final delivery 7/15/2011 (est).  NAICS Code:  334519.  No solicitation documents will be issued.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the Agency.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

Offerors are encouraged to use Standard Form 1449, Solicitation/Contract/Order for Commercial Items form found at http://www.gsa.gov/forms/pdf_file and submit a proposal.
 All qualified responsible business sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.

Proposals received without the completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 may be considered non-compliant. Beginning January 1, 2005, the FAR requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.
 ORCA also allows Government personnel to access your information online, thus eliminating the need for you to submit representations and certifications with each offer. To register in ORCA you will need an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your companys ID and password into ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses.
 The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov/help.aspx . Full text of FAR and DFARS provisions and clauses may be accessed at http://www.farsite.hill.af.mil/vffara.htm and http://farsite.hill.af.mil/VFDFARA.HTM , respectively.

<DESC><p>***PLEASE SEE BELOW FOR VENDOR QUESTIONS AND CUSTOMER RESPONSES***</p>
<p><br />1. It is our understanding that the Creech Air Force Base (CAFB) will provide us with CAD files for the fire sprinkler drawings as well as the structural and HVAC drawings.</p>
<p>820 RHS REPLY: HVAC drawings and structural drawings were provided to 99 CONS for posting.</p>
<p>2. CAFB will provide us with the flow test and a drawing showing and identifying the hydrants used for the flow test labeled with "flow" &amp; "test". Also this drawing will show the underground supply to the main building.</p>
<p>820 RHS REPLY: Flow test data is attached for posting.</p>
<p>3. We discussed the possibility of tie-in the ends of the branch lines to a single drain. Per FP-6 this will not be required since the branch lines run the length of the building and not along the slope of the roof. FP-6 also shows an auxiliary drain for the main.</p>
<p>820 RHS REPLY: Concur. Per original design drawings tie-in at ends of branch lines not required. Vendor may provide this as an option providing that alternate designs must be wet stamped by a registered fire protection engineer and include the hydraulic calculations for the alternate design.</p>
<p>4. We are to provide two bid proposals; One per the bid set drawings and the other for an alternate design to reduce the field labor hours and the possibilities of reducing the pipe sizing.</p>
<p>820 RHS REPLY: Concur. Any alternate designs must be wet stamped by a registered fire protection engineer and include the hydraulic calculations for the alternate design.</p>
<p>5. All the upright sprinkler heads in the high bay area will require 1"<br />sprigs in order to have the sprinkler deflector to be 12" below the deck/insulation.</p>
<p>820 RHS REPLY: With regards to the original design, vendor may include the 1" sprigs in the material listing.</p>
<p>6. Is the ceiling elevation 9'-0"?</p>
<p>820 RHS REPLY: The suspended ceiling will be 8'-0" from the finished floor.<br />On sheet FP-6 the plans are annotated that the drop nipples are 1'-0". The drop nipples are typical of each drop in that section of the facility.<br />Please see the end of each branch line in the admin section of the facility (left side of the sheet).</p>
<p>7. Due to space limitation and obstruction in the riser room, to install the FDC outside the riser room the 2'-6" elevation shown on FP-3 will not be accomplished. Will the AHJ (CAFB) allow a variance to be higher? Otherwise CAFB will have to provide us with a new location of the FDC.</p>
<p>820 RHS REPLY: FDC may be moved to a location conducive to firefighting operations and ease of installation as long as the FDC conforms to UFC<br />3-600-01 and NFPA 13-2010 requirements. FDC must be within</p>
<p>8. Provide the AMES 300 Double Check Backflow preventer with OS&amp;Y and not with Butterfly valve.</p>
<p>820 RHS REPLY: Butterfly valve may be used. This was cleared through the Creech AFB fire department on 21 April 2011 after the site visit.</p>
<p>9. The drawings do not show it, will a top-beam bracket be acceptable as a hanger for both the mains and branch lines?</p>
<p>820 RHS REPLY: Yes, as long as the brackets conform to UFC 3-600-01 and NFPA 13-2010.</p>
<p>10. Submit the base bid with the material shown on the FP drawings.<br />Provide a separate line item for material substitution.</p>
<p>11. CAFB will provide us with a response to all our field questions.</p>
<p>12. In order to use the current design it will be more effective and more economical if they were to use Trapeze hangers in-between the Z-purlins in lieu of lateral bracings of the branch lines. In order for us to price it right the Fire Sprinkler drawings will need to be revised to identify the locations (quantity) and show the Trapeze hanger details. Currently the drawings do not show the location and type of hangers to use.</p>
<p>820 RHS REPLY: Vendor may include trapeze hangers as part of the proposed material listing for the original bid drawings. Hanger spacing must be in accordance with and NFPA 13-2010 requirements.</p>

It is amended to read: <strong>Submit signed and dated offer to 97 CONS/LGCA, 308 N. 1st St., Suite 2301, Altus AFB, OK 73523-5003 at or before 1200 (12:00 P.M) CST,&nbsp;9 May 2011.

Michael Sherlock, 308 N. 1st St, Suite 2301, Altus AFB, OK 73523-5003 at offeror's cost; the government will not reimburse sample cost or costs of shipping the sample(s).<br /><br /></strong>FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers IAW FAR 13.106-2-Evaluation of Quotations or Offers:<br /><br /><strong>Price-<br /></strong>(1) The Government will evaluate offers for award based on the realism and reasonableness of total price proposed for the solicitation.</p>
<p>(2) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussion. Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best price, terms, and conditions.</p>
<p>(3) Realism-Offerors are advised that unrealistically proposed prices, initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that the offer does not understand the requirement or has made an unrealistic proposal. Realism accesses whether the proposed price is compatible with the proposal scope of effort and the requirements of solicitation.</p>
<p>(4) Reasonable is defined as a price that provides best value to the Government when considering current market prices, wage determinations included in the solicitation and technical capabilities of the offerors. Also, a fair price should ensure the offer a reasonable profit commensurate with performance.</p>
<p><strong>Technical-<br /></strong>The proposal will be determined technically acceptable if quote is composed of the items listed in the SOW. If an equal is being proposed, please provide the specifications for any items that are substituted. Clearly indicated the substitutions.</p>
<p><strong>Past Performance-<br /></strong>Submit at least two (2) contracts performed in the last three to five years, comparable in value and requirements. Include name of company/agency, contract number, point of contact (name and phone number), and total dollar value.</p>
<p>Past Performance will be given an overall general assessment risk rating. Performance risk relates to the assessment of an offeror's present and past work record to assess confidence in the offeror's ability to successfully perform the requirements.</p>
<p><br />The following definitions will be used in assessing performance risks:</p>
<p><strong>High</strong>-Significant doubt exists, based on the offeror's performance record that the offeror can perform the proposed effort.</p>
<p><strong>Moderate</strong> - Some doubt exists, based on the offeror's performance record that the offeror can perform the proposed efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Low</strong> - Little doubt exists, based on the offeror's performance record that the offeror can perform the proposed efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Not Applicable</strong> - No significant performance record is identifiable.</p>
<p>Past performance is equal to price. Offer must be found technically acceptable.<br /><br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br /><br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br /><br />FAR 52.203-3 Gratuities (Apr 1984),<br /><br />FAR 52.203-12 Limitation on Payments to Influence Certain Federal Transactions (Oct 2010),<br /><br />FAR 52.204-4 Printed or Copied Double-Sided on Recycled Paper (Aug 2000),<br /><br />FAR 52.204-6, Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number (Apr 2008), If a copy of the provisions are needed, the can be found on arnet.gov/far,<br /><br />FAR 52.211-6, Brand Name or Equal (Aug 1999),<br /><br />Each offeror shall complete paragraphs (c) through (o) of the provision at FAR clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (APR 2011) if offeror has not completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov.

The government will award a contract to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal, conforming to the RFP, will be most advantageous to the Government considering price and technical factors stated in this RFP.  Failure to propose a price for all CLINs will render the proposal unacceptable and the proposal will be rejected.<br><br>     2.  Evaluation factors upon which award will be based, are set forth below.<br><br>(b)  Evaluation Approach<br><br>     1.  The Government will evaluate each proposal by employing the lowest price technically acceptable method.  The written proposal, in conjunction with the on-site evaluation, will be used to assess evaluation factor ratings.<br><br>     2.  All proposals will be subjected to an initial screening by the Contracting Officer to determine whether proposals are complete before being evaluated as detailed below.  Proposals that are considered substantively incomplete after initial screening shall be rejected and offerors will be notified they are no longer eligible for further consideration.  Offerors are advised that unsupported promises to comply with contractual requirements will not be sufficient.  Additionally, a proposal that is unreasonable or incomplete in terms of price will not be considered for award.<br><br>     3.  The Government intends to award without discussions.  Offerors shall ensure their initial proposal contains its best terms from a technical and price standpoint.  However, the Contracting Officer reserves the right to hold discussions if necessary.

Proposals submitted in response to the solicitation will be evaluated based upon the following factors:  Price, Past performance, and Mission Capability.  The Mission Capability and Past Performance factors are equal in importance and when combined are less important than the Price factor.  <br><br>1.  Mission Capability.  Under Mission Capability the following elements will be evaluated: Expert knowledge of JEFTS/ECS2 systems and the timeline for completion of tasks 1-7.  These elements will be evaluated together for acceptability in the Mission Capability area.  The Mission Capability factor will receive one of the following adjectival ratings:<br><br>	ACCEPTABLE  -  Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation (See Note below).<br><br>	UNACCEPTABLE  - Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.<br><br>NOTE:  Expert knowledge of JFETS/ECS2 systems will be a key factor in the selection consideration process. A proposal receiving an Unacceptable rating in this area will NOT be eligible for award.<br><br>	2.  Past Performance. Under Past Performance the following elements will be evaluated:  Experience working in JFETS/ECS2 environment.  The Past Performance Factor will receive one of the adjectival ratings:<br><br>ACCEPTABLE  -  Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown (See Note below). <br><br>	UNACCEPTABLE  - Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.<br><br>NOTE:  No record of past performance will result in an acceptable rating.  Offerors shall submit only past performance relevant to the requirements set forth in this solicitation.  A proposal receiving an Unacceptable rating in this area will NOT be eligible for award.		<br><br>	3.  Price.  Price will be evaluated for reasonableness IAW FAR 15.403-1(c)(1).

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis /solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is HSCEMD-11-Q-00002 and is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) under FAR 13.5. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-49. This procurement is a Total SBA certified-HUBZone Small-Business set-aside. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541690. The size standard is _7 million.</p>
<p>The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), has a requirement for watch officer support for the Joint Intelligence Operations Center (JIOC) in Washington DC in accordance with the attached Performance Work Statement (PWS). The current estimated period of performance is for a 12 month base year and a 12 month option year period. The government intends to transition these positions to federal employees through insourcing and will notify contractor in writing prior to occurrence.</p>
<p>Provisions<br />The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items applies to this acquisition.</p>
<p>Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999)<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors in descending order of importance shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>(1) Technical Capability<br />(2) Past Performance;<br />(3) Price</p>
<p>Technical Capability and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>Instructions<br />The provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition with the following ADDENDUM:</p>
<p>All responses shall include two separate volumes:<br />Volume 1 - Technical Quotation<br />Volume 2 - Price Quotation</p>
<p>Volume 1 Page Limitation:<br />Excluding cover pages, the key personnel resume, any certificates and quality recognitions/awards; the technical quote is limited to __30__ one-sided pages with a maximum of three pages of tables included. A front and back side of a page will count as two pages. Quotation contents that exceed the stated page limitation will be removed from the quote by the Contracting Officer prior to turning the quote over to the Government evaluation team and will not be considered in the evaluation. Volume 2 does not have a page limitation.</p>
<p>Volume 1<br />Technical Capability<br />Offerors are required to describe their approach or plan to accomplish the Performance Work Statement (PWS). The plan should describe existing capability to meet the PWS task requirements and describe how the offeror will manage and implement effectively the tasks required to accomplish the PWS. Include an overview of the corporate organizational structure in the description and describe roles/responsibilities if any team members or subcontractors are included. Describe the corporate quality control plan and performance measurement approach to cover how performance standards will be monitored, evaluated, and reported. A draft QASP is provided with the solicitation recognizing that the successful Offeror's quality control plan may impact the Government's QASP. The QASP will be finalized within 30 days after award.</p>
<p>Provide a staffing plan describing how the staffing required under the PWS will be filled. The staffing plan should include the timeline from receipt of order to the fill of all positions. The contractor shall describe the education and experience qualifications on the proposed personnel in relation to the personnel requirements in the PWS. Include a resume for the On-site Contract Project Manager (CPM), which is considered a key personnel position. The resume should reflect the ability to perform the complexity of the work required in the PWS. The personnel will be evaluated according to the relevant work experience and qualifications to accomplish the PWS.</p>
<p>The offered capability must present sufficient information to reflect a thorough understanding of the work requirements and a detailed plan for achieving the PWS with minimal risk to the Government. Lack of specificity or a general offer to perform the PWS may result in a quote being considered unacceptable and eliminated from further consideration for award. Offers are evaluated on the feasibility and completeness of the technical capability to integrate tasking and achieve the PWS with minimal risk to the Government.</p>
<p>Past Performance<br />Offeror's quote shall provide a summary of at least three current or past contracts for the same or similar services, within the last three years. This information should demonstrate how the Offeror has successfully performed work similar to what is described in the PWS. This summary shall also contain sufficient information for the Government to verify contractor past performance and customer satisfaction as follows. <br /><br />1. project title and contract number <br />2. start and end dates <br />3. contract value <br />4. any awards or quality demonstrators of performance achieved<br />5. respective primary Point of Contact for the customer (name, agency or firm affiliation, city and state, phone number and e-mail)</p>
<p>Successful completion of work activities similar in terms of size, complexity, type of work, as well as receipt of awards/recognition and lack of adverse contractual actions, will result in a higher rating than more narrow experience. If an Offeror has no record of relevant past performance or information on performance is not available, the Offeror will receive a "Neutral" rating, which is neither favorable nor unfavorable.</p>
<p>The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has past performance that will enhance its technical capability to perform and whether the offeror consistently delivers quality services in a timely manner. In evaluating past performance, the Government may supplement the information Offerors provide with performance information it may obtain from any source including its own experience with the Offeror and government agency databases.<br /><br />The contractor shall, as part of its proposal, present a high-level transition plan (no more than two pages long) including major milestones for adding resources and transitioning support responsibilities.</p>
<p>Volume 2<br />Price<br />Offerors shall quote a Time and Materials (T&amp;M) or labor hour type of pricing structure. Travel will be funded as a NTE CLIN (currently est. @ $25,000). The Government will add the est. $25,000 per year to each proposal for total price evaluation purposes. Travel requirements must be preapproved prior to being taken. The offer must submit proposed price by year and include a summary for the base period and the option period. For evaluation purposes, the following anticipated distribution of labor hours by labor categories shall be used by offerors in preparing their price quote. <br /><br /><br />BASE YEAR (12 Months)</p>

<DESC><p>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions posed by a potential quoter.<br /><br />Question 1:&nbsp; Is it contemplated that spent and contaminated solvent is to be recycled in the tool and furthermore that such contamination is considered acceptable? As solvent is there to dissolve material such material cannot be filtered out as it is in solution.<br /><br />Answer 1:&nbsp; Yes, as stated in the specification, each solvent will be recirculated back to its respective supply tank.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Question 2:&nbsp; Is it contemplated that the various solvents to be employed can acceptably contaminate each other or must the be scrupulously separated in the drain system, what level of cross contamination is considered acceptable?<br /><br />Answer 2:&nbsp; Yes, we understand that there will be some level of cross contamination between solvents. We have not stated a level of cross contamination in the specification however it is expected that recipe steps will minimize this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Question 3:&nbsp; Is it contemplated that the solvent process be done to completion before the DIW process is employed to avoid any cross contamination?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Answer 3:&nbsp; Yes, all solvent processing should be complete before the DI water rinse.</p>

<p>Item Description QTY Due Date Deliver To Reference</p>
<p>*A complete list of deliverables is included in the Statement of Work.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>12. CAR 1352.271-72 Additional Item Requirements (AIRs) - Growth Work (APR 2010)<br />(a) This clause applies to Additional Item Requirements (AIR), also known as growth and emergent work ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Changes - Ship Repair clause or mutually agreed upon by the parties. The contractor shall perform AIR at the labor billing rates designated in the Schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.</p>
<p>(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule: <br />(1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance. <br />(2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance. <br />(3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.</p>
<p>(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include: <br />(1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging. <br />(2) Non-production labor hours (whether charged directly or indirectly by contractor's accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).</p>
<p>(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.</p>
<p>(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.</p>
<p>(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals: <br />(1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.<br />(2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced. When requested by the Contracting Officer, material quotes shall be provided. <br />(3) Subcontractor estimates, individually broken out and priced along with the actual subcontractor quotes. The requirement to submit subcontractor quotes may be waived if deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer. <br />(4) Material/subcontractor handling fee and the basis for the fee.</p>
<p>(g) The contractor shall not be entitled to payment for any hours ordered pursuant to this clause until such time as a written contract modification is executed.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>END OF ADDENDUM TO FAR 52.212-4, CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JUN 2008)</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<DESC>Q4:&nbsp; I want to clarify that NOAA is supplying all components for the assemblies except for the bare boards, correct? Also, can we request an extension on the closing date? We do not manufacture bare boards, only populate so I will have to send out these files to our fab houses for a quote.
<p>Answer:&nbsp; NDBC will be supplying all the components to populate the printed circuit boards. Some components such as the compass and potentially the GPS module will be installed on the PCB by NDBC at our own facility on an as needed basis per the required board stack configuration. However, these parts are listed in the bill of materials that was provided in the event there are any issues on the printed circuit board production.</p>
<p>Q5:&nbsp; What type of delivery schedule are you interested in? <br /><br />And are we to assume that the parts to be supplied are production ready for automated processes? So tape and reeled components?<br /><br />Answer:&nbsp; As far as delivery dates whatever is reasonable. The one slight hiccup maybe how long we get to identify any fabrication issues. The engineer can not test the boards individually, they must be tested in stacks. For example if you deliver all the analog board first I have now way to identify if something is not working correctly without the controller board, the stacker boards, power boards and the controller board. So, if we break up the delivery we need to specify that complete stacks be delivered. We are not opposed to staggering the delivery of the stacks. In fact that would allow us time to test and verify their operation in the warranty period.</p>

The requested information is for planning purposes and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that the anticipated procurement will be issued.<br />&nbsp;<br />Interested offerors are requested to submit a statement of interest and a&nbsp;summary of their capability to meet complete C-130J AN/ALR-56M Automatic Test Set production program requirements.&nbsp; In response to this synopsis, parties shall provide information to substantiate they are a responsible and qualified source to produce the complete C-130J AN/ALR-56M Automatic Test Set capability.&nbsp; The offeror's summary shall not exceed&nbsp;25 pages (reports and substantiating documents are not included in this page count).&nbsp; Responses must be received no later than&nbsp;10 calendar days after the initial posting of this announcement and are to be mailed as follows, ATTN: Casey Murphy, 2275 D Street, Building 16, Room 149, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7222.<br /><br />SECURITY CLASSIFICATION: This announcement is UNCLASSIFIED. <br /><strong><br />C-130J AN/ALR-56M RWR Automatic Test Set Program Overview:<br /></strong>The C-130J AN/ALR-56M Automatic Test Set provides an end-to-end (ETE) functional testing capability to determine the status of the installed AN/ALR-56M RWR on operational C-130J aircraft.&nbsp; It automatically determines Go/No-Go status of the installed AN/ALR-56M RWR with minimal technician interaction.&nbsp; In cases where the installed AN/ALR-56M RWR has a critical fault, the C-130J AN/ALR-56M Automatic Test Set detects the failure by identifying the ETE test that failed and providing the diagnostics to isolate the failed aircraft transmission line path/component or Line Replaceable Unit.&nbsp; The C-130J AN/ALR-56M Automatic Test Set can be operated in an automatic or manual mode to provide the identification and isolation of failed AN/ALR-56M RWR components or capabilities and/or associated C-130J aircraft wiring and/or components.&nbsp; The manual mode can be used when the built-in test of the installed AN/ALR-56M RWR, the automatic mode of the C-130J AN/ALR-56M Automatic Test Set, and other organizational-level support equipment, cannot determine the cause of the failure.&nbsp; The estimated period of performance for the production program is 2010 - 2011 and may include two (2) one-year priced options.&nbsp; During this period, an estimated six (6) complete production qualified C-130J AN/ALR-56M Automatic Test Sets and required support may be procured.&nbsp; The USG is seeking a best value solution balancing performance with capability availability.&nbsp; To support user requirements, the complete production qualified C-130J AN/ALR-56M Automatic Test Set capability must be available not later than 30 September 2011.&nbsp; Accordingly, production costs, schedule, and performance will be important considerations. <br /><strong><br />C-130J AN/ALR-56M RWR Automatic Test Set Capability Program Information Requirements:<br /></strong>The "complete C-130J AN/ALR-56M Automatic Test Set capability" shall minimally include the following;

<DESC>This Is A Request For Information Announcement For Purposes Of Conducting Market Research Only. There Is No Solicitation Available At This Time. Requests For A Solicitation Will Not Receive A Response. <br><br>The U. S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC) is conducting market research to identify fabric materials with protection capabilities that would be suitable for use in a duty uniform for state and local law enforcement. The National Protection Center (NPC), NSRDEC, is conducting this effort on behalf of the National Institute of Justice (NIJ). The objective of this program is to identify textile materials that will improve the current level of protection of law enforcement officers while maintaining the current levels of comfort, appearance, and durability. Current law enforcement duty uniforms provide minimum levels of protection. This information will be used by state and local law enforcement to select a uniform material with improved protection capabilities for their specific operational requirements. <br><br>Candidate materials will be classified by weight per Section I below. Three mandatory categories (comfort, appearance & durability) of material characteristics are defined below in Section II. All material candidates should meet the required criteria for comfort, appearance and durability, however, material candidates that do not meet the required criteria will be considered if technical data for all criteria is provided. Desired protection capabilities are defined below in Section III. A candidate material does not need to provide all of the desired protection capabilities as the specific requirement for material protection capability varies across the spectrum of law enforcement agencies. Consequently, multiple material candidates, with different types or levels of protection capability, may be submitted. <br><br>I. Candidate materials will be assigned to one of two weight classes, based on weight: <br>1. Class I: Lightweight - Materials weighing less than 5.75 oz/yd2 2. Class II: Midweight/heavyweight - Materials weighing 5.75 oz/yd2 or more. <br><br>II. All materials should meet the following levels of comfort, appearance and durability, as determined by the following test methods:<br>1. Comfort -<br>a. Air permeability, per ASTM D 737-04. Class I - 50.0 ft3/min/ft2, Class II - 10.0 ft3/min/ft2 2. Appearance a. Material appearance, per AATCC 143-2006 b. Colorfastness, per AATCC 8-2005, 16-2004, 61-2006, and 15-2002 3. Durability a. Abrasion resistance, per ASTM D 3884-07. Class I - 300 cycles without failure, Class II - 500 cycles without failure.<br>b. Burst strength, per ASTM D 3787-07 (applies to knit materials only). Class I & II - 50 lbf.<br>c. Tear strength, per ASTM D 1424-07a (applies to woven & non-woven only). Class I - Warp: 6 lbf (woven & non-woven), Fill: 4 lbf (woven only). Class II - Warp: 9 lbf (woven & non-woven), Fill: 6 lbf (woven only). <br>d. Material breaking strength, per ASTM D 5034-95 (2001) (woven & non-woven only). Class I & II - Warp: 160 lbf (woven), Fill: 80 lbf (woven), 160 lbf (nonwoven only). <br>e. Seam/closure breaking strength, ASTM D 5034-95 (2001). Class I - 45 lbf, Class II - 55 lbf f. Dimensional stability, per AATCC 135-2003 Technical testing data for the above criteria must be included in your response. Data should include the test results, who performed the testing and when it was performed. Complete testing reports are not required. Materials that do not meet some of the above criteria will still be considered, if technical data is supplied identifying the level of the shortcoming.<br><br>III. A candidate material shall meet one or more of the following protection capabilities. The material protection capabilities will be defined by the following test methods:<br>1. Blood borne pathogen resistance, per ASTM F 1671-3.<br>2. Cut resistance, per ASTM F 1790-05. <br>3. Flame resistance, per ASTM D 6413-99. <br>4. Puncture resistance, per ASTM F 1342-05. <br>5. Water repellency, per AATCC 22. <br>6. Ultra Violet (UV) resistance, per AATCC 183-2004.<br>Responses must identify the protection capability(s) claimed. Technical testing data that validates a protection capability must be included in your response. Materials that do not meet the above criteria for a protection capability will still be considered, if technical data is supplied identifying the level of the protection shortcoming. <br><br>The information provided in response to this announcement will be evaluated by the program office. Based on the technical data provided by each respondent, the program office will determine which materials may require additional test and evaluation. The testing will characterize and verify the levels of comfort, appearance and durability as well as any protection performance capabilities. The results of this program will be used by law enforcement to make informed decisions regarding the selection of materials for next generation duty uniforms. <br><br>Because this material is not intended for a Department of Defense or a Department of Homeland Security application nor is the procurement of a law enforcement duty uniform subject to FEMA grant funding, this survey is open to all sources of textile material, both foreign and domestic, to include small businesses. However, local agencies may or may not have procurement rules or regulations pertaining to sourcing of materials. Consequently, sourcing of material will need to be identified in order to meet that possible requirement.<br><br>Respondents to this request for information shall submit: <br>1. A physical description of the material, including weight per square yard, and identify which protection capabilities are offered by this material.<br>2. Test data, in accordance with the criteria mentioned above, to characterize the comfort, durability and appearance of the material. <br>3. Test data, in accordance with the criteria mentioned above, to characterize the protection performance of the material.<br>4. Indicate whether additional material is available for purchase and the lead time required for purchase. <br>5. Identify the sourcing (foreign or domestic) of the material.<br>6. Identify the cost of the material ($ USD/square yard).<br>7. Any information of prior use of this material in another uniform application.<br>8. Any attachments shall be in Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) format.<br><br>The Government will not reimburse any business concern for any information submitted in response to this sources sought request. Submission of information or samples is voluntary. Any proprietary information will be held confidential. Business concerns submitting responses should indicate whether they are large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone or service disabled veteran owned small business. Large business concerns are not prohibited from responding to this announcement. <br><br>This program is a research and development program only. There is no planned procurement action that will accompany this program. Should a procurement of any material evaluated by this program eventually occur, this solicitation will not be conducted by the Army. <br><br>All interested business concerns are required to respond to this request for information announcement via email no later than Friday, 27 May 2011, 3:00 p.m. EDT. Responses must include company point of contact, email address, telephone and fax numbers. All interested business concerns responding to this announcement shall send their submission to Fred Chan via email at fred.chan@us.army.mil.

The project site is located approximately 0.75 miles past the county line on FS Road #90.</p>
<p>The estimated cost of construction for this project is between $25,000 and $100,000. A solicitation for this project work, following the procedures of FAR Part 13 for Simplified Acquisition, will be made available on this web site on or about May 13,2011.

<DESC>This Request for Quote (RFQ) is being posted FedBizOpps, under the Franchise Authority of the Department of the Interior, National Business Center, Acquisition Services Directorate (AQD) on behalf of the Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
AQD is procuring an 8-inch rain gauge (non-recording) and a snow cutter adapter (consisting of the gauge, stand, measuring stick) and looking to gain an understanding of potential vendors that offer the aforementioned products.  The 8-Inch Rain Gauge measures precipitation collected over an area 8-inches in diameter and about 5 feet high prior to field implacement.  The rainfall is funneled into a measuring tube having a diameter such that 1-inch of actual rainfall fills the measuring tube to a height of 10 inches and is made of corrosion resistant steel, anodized aluminum, and a durable polycarbonate plastic.  The special measuring stick is calibrated so that attending personnel may record the actual rainfall directly from the scale reading.  An additional capability for measuring the water equivalence of fallen snow is provided by attaching the Snow Cutter Adapter and handle to the overflow container (funnel cap and measuring tube removed) which is made of corrosion resistant steel.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), intends to compete its requirement for a Shoe Scanning Device (SSD) System. The SSD system will be capable of detecting threat objects concealed in footwear without requiring passengers to remove their footwear as they pass through a security checkpoint. These threat objects include a wide variety of military, commercial, and homemade explosives or explosives devices. Further background information regarding the SSD program is provided at the bottom of this announcement.
<p>The estimated release date for the solicitation is in&nbsp;the week of 01 May, 2011. The Request for Proposals (RFP) will be issued on this same FedBizOps webpage, with the exception of RFP attachments which are considered either Sensitive Security Information (SSI) or Classified National Security Information (CNSI), respectively. In order to be approved to view to these documents upon RFP release, a contractor must meet the requirements and complete the steps listed below prior to 04 April 2011. Non-compliance will not render a contractor ineligible to submit a proposal, however, SSI and/or CNSI cannot be provided otherwise.</p>
<p>SSI:<br />1. Provide the CAGE code of the Contractor's facility that will manage the proposal.<br />2. Designate a Senior Corporate Official, who is responsible for serving as the single point of contact for SSI and certifying to the Contracting Officer every 60 days that all appropriate protections have been followed, only authorized individuals have access to the sensitive information, and that those individuals with access adequately understand their responsibilities to protect the information.<br />3. Provide the following information for all individuals who need to view SSI; provide this information via email in one password protected Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, and send the password in a separate email:<br />a. Contractor/Subcontractor name<br />b. Employee Full Name<br />c. Employee Gender<br />d. Employee Birth Date<br />e. Employee Citizenship<br />f. Employee Social Security Number <br />4. Provide a fully completed and witnessed non-disclosure agreement for all employees who need to view SSI. Use the attached form entitled "Non-Disclosure Agreement."<br />5. Contractors are limited to 35 individuals (inclusive of any subcontractors) who can have access to SSI.<br />6. Only one list of individuals may be submitted. No revisions will be permitted.</p>
<p>CNSI:<br />1. Contractors must have a facility clearance (FCL) at the Secret level and receive a DD-254 from the Government. <br />2. As applicable, contractors must provide information requested by the Government in order to complete any required DD-254, and must follow any instructions contained therein after issuance.<br />3. The Government will use the contractor's CAGE code (provided per the above SSI instructions) to determine the contractor's FCL status.</p>
<p>All information must be emailed to Minh-Ha.Do@dhs.gov and Lance.Nyman@dhs.gov.</p>
<p>The attached documents entitled "Synopsis - SSD - Further Pre-Solicitation SSI Information" and "Synopsis - SSD - Further CNSI Information" contain further information concerning SSI and CNSI, respectively.</p>
<p><br />SSD PROGRAM BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) currently requires that all passenger footwear be removed and scanned by X-ray machines as part of the checkpoint screening process. The removal of footwear takes time, reduces the efficiency of the checkpoint, creates safety concerns with footwear removal and contributes to passenger dissatisfaction. In addition, scanning footwear through the X-ray machine increases the volume of items that the Transportation Security Officers (TSO) at the X-ray machine must visually screen.</p>
<p>Currently 98% of passengers must remove their footwear for screening in the X-ray machine. The high-level goals of the SSD program include:<br />&bull; Achieving the current level of screening capabilities provided by the current Advanced Technology (AT)-2 X-ray machine baseline;<br />&bull; Reducing the number of passengers required to remove their footwear;<br />&bull; Performing screening without increasing TSO staffing levels. <br />&bull; Improve the TSA's ability to screen passengers by increasing probability of detection, expanding detection capability to the full threat list defined in the Classified Requirement Document and reducing the probability of a false alarm.<br />&bull; Increase overall operational throughput by reducing the system scanning time required to process an individual and design the system for ease of movement of passengers to allow for intuitive operation.<br />&bull; Improve reliability, availability, and maintainability by designing the system for quick access to perform preventative maintenance and unscheduled maintenance without needing to move the system. <br />&bull; Preclude the need for preventative maintenance at an unreasonable level (under seven days) or require custom tools to perform preventative maintenance.<br />&bull; Improve deployability of the system by accommodating adaptation to the varying environmental conditions in airports and storage facilities (e.g., temperature, humidity, altitude, etc.).</p>

<DESC><br />J&amp;A_11_8605 <br />JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL<br />FOR USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
<p>1. Contracting Activity.</p>
<p>Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWC-AD) Patuxent River, MD</p>
<p>2. Description of the Action Being Approved.</p>
<p>This Justification and Approval authorizes and approves on a sole source basis a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contract consisting of a three-month base period and three one-month options. This sole source bridge contract will allow for the continuity of critical aircraft maintenance at Naval Surface Weapons Command-Panama City Division (NSWC-PCD) located in Panama City, Florida.</p>
<p>3. Description of Supplies/Services.</p>
<p>This acquisition is for the placement of a sole source bridge contract for the continuation of Organizational ("O") and Intermediate ("I") level aircraft maintenance and logistic support services for MH60S aircraft and support equipment for which the Naval Surface Weapons Command-Panama City Division has maintenance responsibility. Contract FA8108-09-D-0010, Task Order 0002 was competitively awarded to MacAulay-Brown, Inc. by the Air Force Contracts Office, Tinker AFB, Oklahoma as a Firm Fixed Price type Task Order. The current Task Order (FA8108-09-D-0010-0002) will expire 31 March 2011. This sole source bridge contract is necessary to allow sufficient time to process a competitive procurement while providing uninterrupted aircraft maintenance and modification support services for NSWC-PCD. The functions required by the sole source bridge contract are critical to NSWC-PCD's ability to meet schedules and to fulfill critical mission requirements. The period of performance for this effort will consist of a three-month base period (1 April 2011 to 30 June 2011) and three one-month options, potentially extending performance through 30 September 2011. NAVAIR Contracts is currently processing this effort on a Sole Source basis with an anticipated award date of 31 March 2011. It is crucial that this sole source contract be awarded by 31 March 2011 to prevent a lapse in support until the competitive follow-on contract can be awarded. The anticipated award date for the follow-on contract is 30 June 2011.</p>
<p>4. Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition.</p>
<p>10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p><br />5. Rationale Justifying Use of Cited Statutory Authority.</p>
<p>The Air Force Contract Fielding Team (CFT) competitively awarded the existing Task Order for RDT&amp;E Aircraft Maintenance and Modification Support Services to MacAulay-Brown Inc. under Contract FA8108-09-D-0010, Task Order 0002. The incumbent, MacAulay-Brown, Inc., has successfully provided aircraft maintenance and modification services under the current Air Force Task Order for the past two years. Performance by MacAulay-Brown, Inc. during this six month bridge will be seamless and without delay. Subsequently, MacAulay-Brown, Inc. is the only company capable of supplying the short term support within the timeframe allotted. MacAulay-Brown, Inc. has the available resources in place and is ready to continue program execution through 30 September 2011, which will also allow sufficient time for a reasonable transition period, if necessary. Additionally, awarding a bridge contract to other than the incumbent would create a delay of more than 12 months. This delay estimate was determined by the time required to acquire necessary approvals, issue a competitive Request for Proposal and award a new competitive contract. Furthermore, the delay would result in NSWC-PCD not having the required MH60S aircraft support services in place to provide critical aircraft maintenance, logistics and support equipment in direct support of the war fighter. Aircraft maintenance and modification support services are crucial in supporting the test and evaluation environment. A delay or gap in support would be detrimental to mitigating the risk of fatalities during test and evaluation phases.</p>
<p>6. Description of Efforts Made to Solicit Offers from as Many Offerors as Practicable.</p>
<p>A synopsis was posted in FedBizOpps on 25 February 2011 and closed 14 March 2011. The technical team performed market research and determined that indeed there are other vendors capable of providing the required services; however, MacAulay-Brown, Inc. is the only source capable of providing the seamless support necessary to preserve continuity of operations required by NSWC-PCD for this interim bridge effort. MacAulay-Brown, Inc. has the necessary skills, organizational knowledge, and experience to complete tasking requirements in a timely and cost effective manner for this short time period. Additionally, the bridge contract must be in place by 31 March 2011. A sole-source bridge is within the Government's best interest because it is a logical follow-on to a previously competed order issued by the Air Force (FA8108-09-D-0010-0002).</p>
<p>7. Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 15.404, the Contracting Officer will obtain audit/field reports generated by the cognizant Defense Contract Audit Agency, perform price analysis, and obtain adequate information to determine fair and reasonable prices prior to award of any contract.</p>
<p>8. Actions to Remove Barriers to Future Competition.</p>
<p>The follow-on for this requirement is currently being competed and is expected to be awarded before 30 June 2011. This one-time action will prevent a lapse of the critical services required by NSWC-PCD.</p>

THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER: GS-23f-0020U<br><br>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because there is an unusual and compelling urgency and a delay in award would result in serious injury, financial or other, to the Government (FAR 6.302-2). See posted J&A for further information.<br><br>AUTOMATED VALUATION MODEL REPORTS - The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 expanded the Homeowners Assistance Program (HAP) to provide assistance to the following groups of homeowners: wounded warriors, surviving spouses of fallen warriors, permanently relocating service members during the home mortgage crises, and service members and civilian employees impacted by the BRAC 05 announcement.  This expansion of HAP will require the processing of over 17,000 applicants over a three year period, a volume equal to that experienced during throughout the BRAC programs of the 90s.  The ARRA expansion of HAP demands rapid applicant processing and payment.  It also demands accurate valuation estimates of homes within applicants' communities, community value trends over periods of up to four years, and present day values of applicant homes.  In order to meet ARRA goals and objectives, USACE field offices must process applications and pay benefits more quickly than ever before.  The DoD decided that one way to speed applicant processing is to avoid the requirement to use appraisals for home valuations.  Therefore, USACE will use an accurate Automated Valuation Model (AVM) to establish expanded HAP value trends and current values.

<DESC>Analytical Chemistry Wing  (11,500 SF) and Administrative Area Addition (14,500 SF) to the Advanced Chemical Laboratory, Edgewood Area, Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG), MD.  Construct a state-of-the-art advanced analytical chemistry wing for work with supertoxic chemical agents and toxins with associated data reduction space and administrative space. Construction will be phased to keep the existing labs, which contain supertoxic chemical agents, operational.  The contractor will be required to work around these labs during construction. Heating, ventilation and air conditioning system is provided from a central plant. Supporting facilities include utilities; electric service; paving, walks, curbs, and gutters; storm drainage; information systems; and site improvements. APG needs to construct an Advanced Chemistry Lab to meet its current mission. Current facilities are inadequate and now require impermeable surfaces, special chemical hoods with ultra-efficient carbon filtration, and extensive electrical backup systems. Safety and environmental controls are paramount to ensure that personnel and the environment are protected against these supertoxic and lethal materials.  Design analysis prepared for this project indicates that significant experience with highly toxic and surety laboratory construction is necessary to support the successful completion of construction of this project within the established constraints.  Additionally, the project includes significant renovation of existing laboratory and administrative spaces while maintaining daily function and mission requirements within the facility.
