<CONTACT>Nancy Robuck Contract Specialist 3039692229 Nancy_Robuck@nps.gov;
<DESC>THIS IS A TOTAL 8(a)SET-ASIDE. The National Park Service (NPS), Denver Service Center, 12795 West Alameda Parkway, Denver, Colorado, 80225, on behalf of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Division of Engineering, is seeking qualified firm(s) or organization(s) to provide Multi-Disciplinary Architect-Engineer Design Services for a variety of bridge inspection projects at U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service locations throughout United States. BACKGROUND: The U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) owns over 700 bridges on national wildlife refuges, fish hatcheries, and other facilities associated with fish and wildlife conservation.  Many of these bridges serve essential administrative functions or provide visitor access.  The Service bridge safety program was initiated in 1992 to ensure the safety and integrity of the Service's bridges through an inventory and inspection program. Inspections are conducted in accordance with National Bridge Inspection Standards (NBIS) and Service Bridge Safety Program guidelines.  Safety deficiencies are identified and safe load limits calculated.  Maintenance, repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction needs are identified, and preliminary level cost estimates are developed for use by Service managers in setting priorities and to assist in preparing budget proposals.  Data required for submittal to the National Bridge Inventory (NBI) is produced. CONTRACT OBJECTIVE: The objective of this contract is to provide expert technical support for the Service bridge safety program, primarily through bridge inspections and reports. CONTRACT: The base contract period will be for one year with options to extend for four additional one-year periods. Work will be ordered by issuance of firm fixed price or not-to-exceed type task orders.  The maximum ordering limitation for each contract period will be $700,000.00. The guaranteed minimum for each contract period is $20,000.00. SUSTAINABLE DESIGN: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service employs sustainable design principles in all planning and development.  By definition, this means meeting present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.  In practice, sustainable design conserves global resources, utilizes energy efficiently, recycles materials and waste, and specifies ecologically responsible methods, practices, and materials in the construction, maintenance and operation of Government facilities. The Government will not indemnify the firm selected against liability involving asbestos or other hazardous materials; that is, a clause holding the firm harmless will not be included in the contract.  PRIMARY SERVICES REQUIRED: The Contractor shall be required to furnish Title I, II, or III Services to the Fish and Wildlife Service for facilities in various locations nationwide.  Typical services include inspection and evaluation of bridges with regard to condition, safety, and serviceability, including review of any existing information or previous inspection reports, determining maintenance, repair, rehabilitation, and new construction needs, calculating new or verifying previous load ratings, cost estimates for needed work, report preparation, and  sketch level drawings of the bridges. Contractor to utilize web-based database which resides within the Service's Engineering Facilities Management Information System (EFMIS) to perform data-entry of bridge safety inspection reports.  This will include, but is not limited to entry of the National Bridge Inventory reporting requirements, entry of bridge inspection finding data, uploading of bridge photos (digital color 35 mm photographs of the inspections will usually be required).  Presentation of inspection results to Service regional  personnel may also be required.  Most of the inspections will be reinspection of bridges inspected in previous cycles, however, some may be initial inspection of newly constructed or newly acquired bridges not previously inspected. The services to be performed will require travel nationwide for the inspections, and to the regional offices when required. This contract is issued primarily for inspection of Fish and Wildlife Service bridges. However, while not currently planned, this does not exclude the inspection of bridges owned by other agencies of the Department of Interior under this contract if desired and within the capability of the contractor to perform such inspections.  Such inspections would be accomplished within the dollar limits included in the contract.  In the course of doing business with Architect/Engineering firms under contract with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Service occasionally needs to obtain specialized services from subconsultants under the prime contract.  In these instances, the majority of the work may be performed solely by the subconsultant with little involvement of the prime.  Even though the work is performed primarily by the subconsultant, the Service will ensure that the prime contractor is involved in all discussions and all correspondence is routed through the prime contractor.  Prime contractors have indicated concerns with the monetary ceiling amounts and the effect of "pass-throughs". This has been taken into consideration in establishing the maximum contract amount for this solicitation and the resultant contract.  Prime contractors submitting statements of qualifications are advised that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will continue to acquire such specialized services in this manner.   The A/E will need to have direct contact with Federal, State or local regulatory agencies to assure compliance with regulations, codes and policies. REQUIRED DISCIPLINES: Bridge engineering, Structural engineering, Hydraulic engineering, and Geotechnical engineering.  Incidental services, e.g. sketch drafting, report generation (data-entry/printing), word processing, cost estimating, etc., may be required in the performance of specific task order requirements.  TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA: Statements of Qualification will be evaluated by a selection committee of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service personnel based upon the following primary criteria, listed in descending order of importance: Evaluation Criteria: Item number 1 is highest in value; item numbers 2, 3, and 4 are approximately equal in value.)1. Past performance on contracts with Fish and Wildlife Service and/or other government agencies and private industry in the areas of quality of work, compliance with performance schedules, and cost control.  Familiarity with Fish and Wildlife Service facilities, procedures, bridge safety program and manual.  2. Specialized experience, technical competence, education, training, and applicable professional registration of proposed project personnel, including subcontractors, in the type of work required, which consists of bridge safety inspections, condition evaluation, determining maintenance, repair, rehabilitation, and new construction needs, load ratings, and cost estimates for needed work.  Also report preparation and computerized data base operation. 3. Professional qualifications of the firm, which consists of experience and technical competence of the firm in comparable work, project management, and proposed project organization including experience in working together as a team. 4. Adequacy of resources and priority and commitment of the firm and proposed subcontractors within present workload to perform this contract, including nationwide travel and having vehicular resources and equipment for field inspections. When responding to this announcement, firms should fully address their capability, capacity and qualifications with regard to each of the foregoing evaluation factors. SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: This contract is reserved exclusively for firms that are certified by the Small Business Administration as 8(a) firms.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This requirement will be satisfied using commercial acquisition procedures specified in FAR Parts 12 and 13.5.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; firm-fixed-priced proposals for procurement of the following items are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number DTCG38-02-R-H00004 is being assigned to this procurement for tracking purposes only and this synopsis/solicitation is being issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The incorporated clauses and provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-07.  This requirement is unrestricted, the North American Industry Classification Code is 421860 and the size standard is 500 employees.  The Coast Guard seeks to award one contract for the procurement of the following items and the corresponding quantities.  Firm-fixed prices are required for these items and orders will be issued on an ?as-required? basis.  The anticipated contract term shall be for a one-year basic period beginning at the date of award with four (4) one-year option periods, renewable annually.  The Coast Guard reserves the right to award one contract for the entire quantity specified by this announcement.  If it determined to be in the best interest of the government and if funds are available, the Coast Guard may issue one delivery order for the entire contract quantity and a staggered delivery schedule will be negotiated.  At this time, the estimated quantities required are thirty (30) starters for each contractual period for a contract total quantity of 150 starters.  Offerors should submit two proposals; (1) Firm-fixed prices for thirty (30) starters for the base period and each of the four (4) option periods; and (2) Firm-fixed prices for a one-time order of 150 starters with a staggered delivery schedule.  There are no minimum or maximum quantities; however, price reductions for larger quantities will be favorably considered.  The Air Turbine Starter must be compatible with the HC-130 aircraft and the Rolls Royce T56A-15 engine.  Offerors must forward maintenance/overhaul manuals and any subsequent revisions to those manuals as Not Separately Priced Items for the life of the resulting contract.  Revisions to specifications needed after contract expiration may be purchased upon notification by the contractor of availability.  The maintenance/overhaul manuals are required for U.S. Coast Guard use only.  The Air Turbine Starter submitted must be an established starter for the HC-130 Aircraft and the Rolls Royce T56-15 engine.  The Coast Guard will not evaluate First Article Test specimens.  This requirement will be satisfied as a ?Best Value? procurement; the technical factors listed herein are considered to be significantly more important than offered price.  However, as technical evaluations become more equal among competitors, price will become the deciding factor for award.  The technical evaluation factors are listed in descending order of importance.  More credit will be given for more relevant information and more credit will be given for most recent information.  Offerors are required to submit a listing of users of the Air Turbine Starter submitted for consideration, with a point of contact, telephone number, company or agency, and email address.  Offerors must submit data pertinent to average Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF); maintainability to include actual time required to remove the starter from the aircraft and ease of reinstallation; authorized maintenance facilities; average cost of overhaul; and availability of replacement parts.  
 
Offeror?s are required to submit data relevant to delivery performance and number of Quality-Related Failures, either for the manufacture or overhaul for the Air Turbine Starter submitted for consideration.  A twelve (12) month warranty from date of installation is required for any starter submitted for consideration; warranties offered that exceed the 12-month required warranty will be given extra credit.  Inspection and acceptance shall be performed by Defense Contract Management Command at the contractor?s facility.  Additionally, a Certificate of Conformance in accordance with FAR 52.246-15(b) is required with each component shipped.  Offerors are invited on either an F.o.b. destination or origin basis.  Proposals submitted on an F.o.b. origin basis will be assessed estimated shipping costs in order to evaluate total proposal cost.  Offerors? proposals must include a delivery schedule; however, delivery is required no later than ninety days after receipt of delivery order.  Earlier deliveries are acceptable and desired at no additional cost to the Coast Guard.  Upon contract award, if a one-time order of the total starter requirement is not issued, the successful offeror can expect an immediate delivery order for a quantity of thirty starters, but not to exceed 60 starters and may submit a staggered delivery schedule for orders exceeding thirty (30) starters.  Items shall be shipped to USCG ARSC, Receiving Section, Bldg. 63, Elizabeth City, NC  27909-5001 unless otherwise directed by the delivery orders.  Copies of packing slips and the Certificate of Conformance shall be affixed to the outside of the shipping container.  Packaging of the items for return shipment shall be in accordance with the Contractor?s best commercial practices with the following exceptions.  Each item or unit must individually packed in a separate box, carton, or crate.  Each individual container shall be labeled on the outside with National Stock Number, Part Number, Serial Number, Quantity, Nomenclature, Contract Number, Line Item, and Delivery Order Number. Only Bar Coding of the National Stock Number is necessary.  The internal packaging material shall be sufficient to prevent damage during shipment, handling and storage.  Each unit shall be packaged to protect against electrostatic damage.  Preservation protection must be sufficient to prevent corrosion, deterioration or decay during warehouse storage for a period of one year, but no preservation coating will be applied directly to the component.  Packaging material shall NOT consist of the following material: popcorn, shredded paper, styrofoam of any type, or peanut style packaging.  Offers are required by 3:00 pm EST on 16 August 2002.  Facsimile offers are acceptable and may be forwarded via fax number 252-335-6452.

The Total Gross Area of the Building is 1,085,741 gsf (100,870 gsm).

The building is currently equipped with a Honeywell Delta 1000 software driven Building Automation System.  The Delta 1000 provides security, energy management, automatic sprinkler control and patrol tour, as well as serving as the fire detection and alarm control system. This project will involve the installation of a new addressable, analog fire alarm/voice communication system as a stand-alone system from the existing Delta 1000 system.

The optics Module shall exhibit no more than 1 failure out of any  100 consecutive rangings thereby determining the range to targets under the conditions that the emitter beam shall be parallel to the Optics Module Assembly optical axis,the emitter shall output 2 pulses, one for the start time, one for the stop time, and  the emitter energy output shall correspond to the energy reflected  from a target 9990 meters distant. Laser Module:-The Laser Module consists of several components/assembly that receives high voltage from the Power Supply Module (in the Electronic Module) and charges the storage capacitor, when the Charge Switch is presse d. The Pulse Forming Network(PFN) uses a capacitor to store energy during the Charge cycle. When the capacitor is fully charged, the ready indicator illuminates. The laser, consisting of the flash lamp,laser rod,Q-switch assembly and partial mirror assembl y, produces an output beam. This beam travels through the Output Collimating Telescope, which is made up of a corner cube prism, telescope objective lenses, and the(visible light filter)output window. Electronics Module:- The Electronics Module consists of  several modules/switches. The Power Supply Module,depending on the position of the Mode Switch, supplies; 5Vdc to the specified circuits in the Optics and Laser Modules. 12 Vdc to the Receiver Module circuits in the Optics Module.Switched 24 Vdc. High Vol tage for the laser Module (700 to 850 Vdc.) The Mode Switch connects battery power to the Power Supply Module circuits.The Mode Switch has 4 positions: OFF, FIRST RTN,LAST RTN, TEST (PULL).With the Mode Switch in FIRST RTN or LAST RTN, the charge switch wi ll initiate the charging of the PFN(Pulse Forming Network) capacitor in the Laser Module and,when the capacitor reaches the set voltage level,the ready indicator will illuminate in the display to the left of the range digits. CECOM prefers an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ )type contract to be awarded at the early/Mid of FY 2003.

PROOFS: Provide 2 sets of laminated halftone dot "DuPont Color Versatility" proofs only, stripped to show the full press sheet imposition, including colorbar, showing guide, gripper and ruled-up for all bindery marks of each form, plus 2 dylux proofs, with all elements in proper position, trimmed to final size.  NCI shall retain one complete set.  Laminated proofs shall match the required PMS colors exactly or the contractor can, at their option, provide press proofs for evaluation.  Digital "process build" or stochastic proofs are not acceptable.  PAPER: Covers -100 lb. white premium, dull recycled cover, target brightness of 90. (Strobe, Utopia, Vintage Velvet or an approved equal). Text -80 lb. white #1 Patina matte finish text, target brightness of 90. (Frostbrite, Mountie, Moistrite or an approved equal).  Only those papers listed above as approved #1 sheet equals will be considered.  See the 35th edition ('01-02' issue) of the Competitive Grade Finder.  Both the text stock and cover stocks, when required, must be the same brand name items, and all the leaves within each book must be matching.  American mill brand manufactured papers only, private label and or foreign manufactured papers shall not be acceptable.  INKS: 4/C process, PMS 102 Yellow, PMS 2747 Blue, PMS Rhodamine Red and Black Ink.  Solid inks required, no builds allowed.

<DESC>The Tashkent University of Information Technologies (TUIT) invites submission of Proposals from interested U.S. firms, which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to conduct a feasibility study on establishing a Center for Women's Training in Telecom and IT in Uzbekistan.

Tashkent Electro-technical Institute of Communications, which has been transformed into Tashkent University of Information Technologies ("TUIT"), was founded in 1955. It is now the most prominent higher educational institution in Central Asia in the fields of communications and information systems. More than thirty-five hundred students study at TUIT, an institution that features thirty-one departments, forty-eight educational laboratories, seventeen scientific-research laboratories, a TV center for internal broadcasting, a computer center with local networks, and a library with 380,000 books. Currently, TUIT offers a wide range of undergraduate, graduate, and professional programs, most of which lead to a doctorate for national and international students, TUIT's instructional programs provide education in various specializations: computer technology, radio and automatic telecommunications, military communications, and economics and communications management.

TUIT created a program for the development of post-graduate curriculum in co-operation with a number of international institutions. This Post Academic Degree in Telematics ("PADITEL") Center includes: a curriculum developed according to the latest Western standards and techniques; a modern multimedia laboratory; an established Internet connection, providing a high level of information exchange.

TUIT faculty members and students regularly visit Europe for training on specific technical topics. TUIT's LIBANTA project (Library Antwerp Tashkent), in collaboration with Hogeschool Antwerpen, promotes the use of new information and communication technologies by students and staff of TUIT through TUIT's modern library and information center. TUIT was involved in a United Nations Development Program project on development of distance education system and is now a member of the Regional Union of Communications of the NIS and the International Union of Electro-communications.

TUIT has always been open to innovative joint ventures and partnerships. The current TUIT curriculum needs to be updated to include new business related courses. In addition, TUIT economic and management faculty need to be trained in specifically targeted economic and management programs that will enable these departments to develop new business-related courses.

Within this overall national Uzbek education goal, TUIT since the beginning of 2001, under the authorization of, and funding by, Uzbek Post and Telecommunications (UAPT), began to take a number of innovative educational initiatives including the establishment of the Base System of Distance Learning (BSDL) program for the Republic of Uzbekistan. BSDL is a corporate Intranet network developed and based on technical, programming and information resources of TUIT. BSDL covers all of Uzbekistan. Within the project's framework and in close collaboration with regional branches of UAPT creation of Regional Centers of Distance Learning in each province of the Republic has begun. Pilot Regional Centers of Distance Learning have been established and are successfully working in Tashkent, Samarkand, and Bukhara. These Centers provide public access to remote educational and informational resources of TUIT through corporate Intranet facilities. In the future, the BSDL network will also include small rural districts in the country. It is anticipated that public schools, colleges, institutions of higher education, various organizations and local population will become clients of BSDL. 

Although the Uzbek government has established the development of a national educational system as a priority, inherent difficulties constrain the development of numerous aspects of higher education - including the absence of specific training programs for women and minorities.   There has recently been a decline in enrollment in higher education, and particularly among women because the costs have become unaffordable.  There is also relatively little variety of higher education programs that women can pursue, which puts them at a disadvantage in the job market.

In keeping with TUIT's innovative role in Uzbek higher education, this Study would explore the establishment, at TUIT, the Central Asian Center for Women's Training in Telecommunications and Information Technology (the "Center"). The Center's objectives would include: 

1)	To promote higher educational opportunities for Uzbek (and other Central Asian) women in the telecommunications and information technology sectors;
2)	To promote the professional development of women Faculty members at the Center;
3)	To provide financial resources and scholarship programs that would enable Uzbek (and other Central Asian women) to enroll in the Center;
4)	To establish a long term partnership with an American university that has the ability to provide on-going technical and financial assistance to the Center;
5)	To promote the professional development of women in the Uzbek (and Central Asian) telecommunications and IT sectors; and
6)	To acquire the necessary equipment from U.S. manufacturers to further these objectives.

The U.S. firm selected to conduct this feasibility study will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $187,185 grant to the Tashkent University of Information Technologies from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).
 
A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP) is available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mailroom before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.

Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Tashkent University of Information Technologies reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.   Tashkent University of Information Technologies also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Tashkent University of Information Technologies is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) intend to negotiate under FAR Part 13 - SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITIONS PROCEDURES on sole source basis with the National Association of Social Workers (NASW), 750 First Street, NE, Suite 700, Washington, DC  20002.  This acquisition is to implement activities to assist in meeting the Emergency Medical Services for Children Five-Year Plan objectives; in consultation with the HRSA Office of Communications, communicate emergency medical services (EMS) for children issues through annual meetings, newsletters, and other communication vehicles; participate in meetings of the EMS Partnership for Children (PFC) consortium; and direct and support the process for the revision, implementation, and evaluation of the bereavement practice guidelines training program for social workers in the emergency department (ED).  NASW is the premier organization for the promotion of quality social work practice and provides leadership in the development of social policy.  NASW experience with the development of social policy, provisions of technical assistance and training provides the company with the unique position to revise, implement and evaluate the bereavement practices guidelines training programs for social works in the Emergency Department.  NASW is the sole owner of the database, which contains a national registry of social workers to distribute information to members.  Any other organization that attempts to development this type of database would have to replicate their previous accomplishments.  This replication would be a substantial duplication of cost that would not be recovered through competition.  Therefore, the National Association of Social Workers (NASW) is a responsible source without substantial duplication of cost to the Government under authority 41 U.S.C. 253 ( c ), (1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1 (B) (1).  This is not a solicitation and published for information purposes only.  A copy of the Justification For Other Than Full and Open Competition is on file.

The purpose of this contract would be to enable the DHHS Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) to develop and make available a research and technical assistance capability to assist states interested in replicating or developing new variants of the "cash and counseling" model of consumer-directed home and community-based services.   The contract will establish a research and technical assistance center (RTAC) whose principal purpose will be to diffuse the specialized knowledge and expertise about innovative approaches to consumer-directed services gained through the implementation of the original "Cash and Counseling" Demonstration and Evaluation (CCDE) co-sponsored by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) and ASPE.   Therefore, a major requirement for the contractor is expertise and experience with regard to the planning and implementation of the CCDE. Boston College has, on staff, the project director for the CCDE, who clearly possesses the relevant expertise and experience.   Prior to the award of this contract, the RWJF plans to award a grant of approximately $400,000 to Boston College to seed the development of the RTAC.  In addition, the RWJF has in development a much larger proposed initiative involving grants to states in 2003, in which the RTAC would have a significant role.   Any other contractor proposing to bid on this contract would have to 1) demonstrate expertise and experience with respect to the "Cash and Counseling" Demonstration and Evaluation sufficient to provide extensive technical assistance to states on how to about replicating the "cash and counseling" innovation in their states and 2) provide a source of funds for approximately half the cost of developing a research and technical assistance center to diffuse the innovative approach to consumer-directed services delivery pioneered in the CCDE.  The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether there may be other sources with the requisite qualifications to perform the work described above.  Any organization capable of performing the work should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Government's requirement as described above including a specific statement addressing the second factor listed above (source of additional funding).  No solicitation document is available.  Capability statements should be submitted within 45 days of the publication of this synopsis to the contract point and address given above.  See Note 22.

These tools are used to analyze data obtained from more than 6,500 interviews with executives from Global 3,500 companies and their partners and suppliers, in-depth interviewing with technology vendors and suppliers of related services, and approximately 400,000 custom surveys completed annually by North American and European consumers about their on-line behaviors, attitudes toward technology, life experiences, demographics, etc.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 511210 (Software Publishers) and the small business size standard is $21.0 million.

A request for documentation will not be considered an affirmative response.  If no affirmative written response is received that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all requirements and that it is more advantageous to the Government, we intend to make a sole-source award to Forrester Research, Inc.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Ques:  What is the color of the chassis? Black vs. Gray
Ans:  No color preference

Ques:   Will you accept the 45U cabinet from Tripp Lite?
Ans:  If it holds everything in a single rack, yes. 

Ques:  Do you need the first cooling fan and tray to be installed with the cabinet and the other two as spare parts? 
Ans:  We only need enough fans to fill the rack in whatever configuration it comes in.  Our requirement, however, is that whatever rack is chosen, it has the ability for highly efficient cooling. 
Ques:  Will you accept Samsung 753DF because we cannot locate any 753DP?
Ans:  As long as it is a 17" (or larger) monitor with similar specifications, it should suffice. 
 Ques:   Do you need keyboard and mouse for each of the 16 slave computer?

Ans:  No.  A keyboard and mouse is only required for the master node and for the separate terminal system. 
 
Ques:  Do you have a preference for how many pieces of memory to be installed into Master and Slave Nodes? 
Ans:  4 by 512
Ques:  Do you have a requirement for a specific Hard Drive manufacturer (2-80 GB, 7200 RPM IDE Hard Drive IDE)?  
Ans:  no preference

Ques:  CD Read/Write compact disk drive on Master Node, do you have a requirement for a specific speed?  
Ans:  24X
Ques:   Do you have a requirement for a specific manufacturer?  
Ans:  No preference.
Ques:  For the Workstation, FSB for Intel Pentium 4 2.0 GHz CPU is 400MHz, the next step up is 533MHz.  Is your requirement 400MHz or 533MHz FSB.
Ans:  400MHz is minimum requirement, if cost difference isn?t significant, will consider 533MHz FSB.
Ques:  Which version of Linux do you require on the workstation?  
Ans:  Professional 
Ques:  Tape Drive, which OverLand DLT 8000 Drive do you require? 
Ans:  The requirement is that we have a tape backup system that can store approximately 800GB of (compressed) data and can be set up to be automated.  Ideally, it would be nice to rackmount the drive, but only if the entire system can stay within a single rack.  Otherwise, a table-top model is fine.  There is no particular preference on tape-drive manufacturer.

<DESC>Please note the important Document Security Requirements below. This form is to be completed and returned prior to release of bid documents.
DOCUMENT SECURITY
NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE BIDDERS/OFFERORS

This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information.  SBU documents provided under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only.  In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per the solicitation.

REASONABLE CARE:

1.	Limiting dissemination to authorized users.  Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it.  The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know.  Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA.  This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary in order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contract, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.  

NOTE:  It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records or recipients.  

Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:

	Valid identification for non-Government users.  Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information.  The identification shall be presented and verified for each dissemination.  Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and including item (d), as necessary.

(a)	A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business.  The license at a minimum shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company.  The business must be of the type required to do the work.  A general contractor's license may be substituted for the business license in states that issue such licenses.  In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitter; and   

(b)	Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certifications.  Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun & Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and 

(c)	A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary, 

(d)	A Valid picture state driver's license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents.  Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s) picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents.  SBU documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously or at the time of pickup, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) though (c), above.

2.	Retaining and destroying documents.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term o f the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter as may be necessary.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/'or physically destroying CD's, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

3.	Term of Effectiveness.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of contract and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the Government.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. 

4.	Written agreement of disposal.   For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractor's record copy, at the time of Release of Claims to obtain final payment.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning, or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.

I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

<DESC>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) seeks a qualified firm to provide an automated Time, Attendance and Scheduling system initially for passenger and baggage screeners and Federal Air Marshals (FAMs), and ultimately the entire agency.  The estimated initial workforce is 70,000 individuals located throughout the nation, all fifty (50) States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Guam.  The TSA seeks a firm with a demonstrated history of successful implementations of similar scope and magnitude.  In line with current Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Congressional guidance, the system must be commercial off the shelf software (COTS).  The vendor must provide the full range of Engineering, Hardware, Software, Maintenance, Helpdesk and Training Services.  A variety of time capture mechanisms are required, direct/online entry, for office personnel; remote access via a telephone or similar device; and time clock entry (possibly biometric, card swipe, bar code reader or other similar technology) for screeners.  There is a goal to minimize the amount of ongoing technical support in the field, so the data collected should be verified, corrected (as necessary) and approved via a browser-based or similar technology that reduces the amount of software to be maintained and updated on the supervisors PC or similar device.  As these data will need to be interfaced to the Department of Transportations (DOT) legacy Time and Attendance system, Integrated Payroll Personnel System (IPPS) and accept data inputs from the DOTs legacy personnel, Consolidated Personnel Management Information System (CPMIS) and the payroll systems, Consolidated Uniform Payroll System (CUPS).  A robust and flexible toolset for interface development is required.  

      Interested parties shall submit a qualification statement, not exceeding ten (10) pages that address the following issues.

      a.Identify two (2) installations of similar scope and magnitude that your company performed as prime contractor.  Similar scope and magnitude is defined as national wide implementation of a system covering at least 50,000 employees.  Provide the name of the customer(s), name(s) of the point of contract, with telephone number.  Identify whether it was a Government or commercial entity.
        b.General Corporate capabilities, to include, but not limited to; length of time in business, number of employees, locations nation wide and manufacturing capability.
        c.Identify the work force management and measurement features of the system which track and automatically report schedules, overtime, attendance, and actual vs. schedule variances.

    A Government Team will evaluate the qualification statements received and will determine which submission meets the Governments need/requirement, as stated above.  Any Contractor who fails to meet the requirement may be excluded from any further consideration.

Responses may be submitted via facsimile, to (202) 493-1746, email, to paul.casagrande@tsa.dot.gov or sent to:  Department of Transportation, Transportation Security Administration, Office of Acquisition, Attn:  Paul A Casagrande, 400 7th St. S.W., Washington, DC 20590.  Responses are due by close of business Wednesday, July 31, 2002.

<CONTACT>Mary Bretz Office Assistant 5038086359     Mary_Bretz@or.blm.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management proposes to noncompetitively award a contract to Boies Hall/Renegade Exploration to provide geological work related to the Nicore Project near Cave Junction, Oregon.  The Nicore Project involves a Court-ordered validity examination of 151 placer mining claims covering 4,380 acres in mountainous terrain.  The claim group extends 3.5 miles in a north-south direction and 3.5 miles in an east-west direction with claims falling in 15 different sections.  The claims are allegedly valuable for such minerals as nickel, copper, cobalt, chrome, and iron; they are found in a laterite surface deposit caused by the weathering of the parent rock which enriched the metallic content near the surface.  The deposit has been extensively mapped, sampled, and evaluated by Inspiration Consolidated Copper Company beginning about 1972 and ending about 1984.  The work will consist of data acquisition, data review, geological field work, sampling, and report writing.  Boies Hall/Renegade Exploration  has been selected to provide this work because Boies Hall served as District Geologist and Project Manager over all aspects of geologic mapping, sample site selection, trenching, sampling, and resource characterization during the 12-year period that Inspiration explored the Nicore claims.  He is the only contractor known to possess the ability to verify, reconstruct, and write up technical data that he had personally generated while working for Inspiration.   Any other contractor will need to conduct extensive geologic mapping, excavate hundreds of trackhoe trenches, collect thousands of samples, assay the samples, and analyze the resources on the 151 mining claim group.  Firms who believe they can provide the geological work required should submit their qualifications in writing to the Contracting Officer.   See Numbered Note(s): 1.

<CONTACT>Doris Turner, Purchasing Agent, Phone (303) 497-3872, Fax (303) 497-3163, Email doris.p.turner@noaa.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) requires a custom software interface to a high-speed arbitrary bit stream generator (ABSG) in order to further the aims of the ac Josephson voltage standard.  The ABSG is a custom-built electronics system, which shall output bit streams at 10 Giga bits per second.  These bit streams are stored in high speed DRAM in order to meet the speed requirements of the data output.  The ABSG is controlled by an embedded PC104 computer running the Linux operating system. There is 128 Mbytes of DRAM in which to store patterns.  Any single code (bit stream) must occupy a contiguous section of DRAM. Rudimentary software and hardware exists to load bit streams into memory, and perform all basic hardware operations.  The data to be loaded into DRAM must exist either on a local file system (of limited size), or a networked file system.  NIST requires a software package including graphical user interface (GUI) to be written for the ABSG to enhance the usability of the system. The package must consist of two parts, code for the PC104 computer to manage resources in the ABSG and a GUI for the end user to control the ABSG.  The software system may either be written as custom client/server architecture or as a web-page/web-server system.  Note should be taken of the limited processing power of the PC104 computer.  If a client/server approach is taken, the GUI shall be written in a standard scripting language that is portable across many host platforms.  The GUI should perform the following actions: 1. Load bit streams into DRAM, either from local or networked storage;  2. Delete bit streams from DRAM;  3. Re-arrange patterns in DRAM to maximize availability;  4. Display the loaded patterns; 5. Start/Stop the running of the code; 6. Real-time control over the amplitude, phase, and offset adjustments of the ABSG output;  7.  Connection manager to insure that multiple users are not controlling the ABSG simultaneously;  8.  Because of the limitations in the design, the DRAM will only be written to by the GUI; DRAM reads will not be allowed.   Software developed shall be considered "Open Source," and not subject to copyrights or restrictions. Software should be available to everyone at no cost and NIST will own source codes.  Proposals shall be graded on usability of the interface, the portability over many client platforms, and the ability to meet the technical specifications.  The vendor must be willing to travel to NIST, Boulder Labs as frequently as needed by NIST staff in order to design, implement and debug the design.  Delivery shall be 120 from receipt of order.  Vendors shall be evaluated based on demonstrated direct experience with instrumentation interfacing, knowledge of appropriate languages, and demonstrated on-time delivery. Vendors should submit information and references supporting these criteria. Proposals shall be graded on usability of the proposed interface (interface, the portability over many client platforms, and the ability to meet the technical specifications.  The scoring will be:  Demonstrated experience and references (40%); Technical merit of proposed interface (40 %); Portability of interface (20%).   It is not the intent of the Government to issue a separate solicitation for this requirement.  Interested sources proposing to supply these items must submit a written qualification statement by fax, clearly establishing capability to meet the above requirements.  Faxed quotes are acceptable and should be sent to 303-497-3163.  Quotes are required by August 14, 2002.  No separate solicitation will be issued.  This announcement/solicitation is being issued in accordance with Simplified Acquisition Procedures, FAR Part 13 (NTE $100,000). FAR Clauses in full text are at  http://www.ARNET.gov/far/.

<SUBJECT>99--OPEN FORUM MEETING CONCERNING NASA'S PROCUREMENT POLICIES
<DESC>SUMMARY: NASA will conduct an open forum meeting to solicit questions, views and opinions of interested persons or firms concerning NASA's procurement policies, practices, and initiatives.  The purpose of the meeting is to have an open discussion between NASA's Assistant Administrator for Procurement, industry, and the public.  Note: This is not a meeting about doing business with NASA for new firms, nor does it focus particularly on small businesses or specific contracting opportunities. DATE: Thursday, August 8, 2002, from 10AM to 11:30AM ADDRESS: The meeting will be held at the NASA Ames Research Center, Bldg. 201 Auditorium, Moffett Field, CA 94035. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mike Basta, NASA Ames Research Center, Mail Code 241-1, Moffett Field, CA 94035, (650) 604-4010. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Format: There will be a presentation by the Assistant Administrator for Procurement, followed by a question and answer period.  Procurement issues will be discussed, including NASA newest initiatives used in the award and administration of contracts.  Admittance:  Doors will open at a half-hour prior to the presentation.  Adequate availability of seating is expected; therefore, reservations are not required nor are requests for reservations being accepted.  Questions for the open forum should be presented at the meeting and should not be submitted in advance.  Position papers are not being solicited.  Visitors who do not currently have NASA-ARC badges will be required to obtain visitor badges at the front gate visitor center the morning of the conference; therefore, early arrival is advised for those who need visitor badges.  In order to obtain a visitor badge, at least 3 days' advance notice will be required; proper identification (e.g., valid driver's license) will be need to be presented upon issuance of a visitor badge, which will be available only to U.S. citizens.  Advance notice of the need for a visitor badge must be provided to Carole Wilson, at (650)604-3773; FAX (650)604-4646, no later than 10AM, August  5, 2002. Innovations: In addition to the general discussion mentioned above, NASA invites comments or questions relative to its ongoing Procurement Innovations, some of which include, but are not limited to, the following: Competitive Sourcing.  This initiative is part of the President's Management Agenda.  The process of competition provides a focus on continuous improvement of government functions and can remove roadblocks to better performance and greater efficiency.  At NASA, it includes, but is not limited to, considering exposing government activities to competition with the private sector. Focus on Safety & Health.  This ensures that contractors take all reasonable safety and occupational health measures in performing NASA contracts. Risk-Based Acquisition Management. This initiative seeks to integrate the principles of risk management throughout the acquisition process by purposefully considering the various aspects of risk when developing the acquisition strategy, selecting sources, choosing contract type, structuring fee incentives, and conducting contractor surveillance.   Performance Based Contracting.  This initiative is focused on structuring an acquisition around the purpose of the work to be performed rather than using broad, imprecise statements or prescribing how the work is to be performed. Award Term Initiative.  This initiative will test a non-traditional method of motivating and rewarding contractor performance.  Contractors will receive periodic performance evaluations and scores, which can result in an extension of the term of the contract in return for excellent performance.

<SUBJECT>19 -- Request for Information-Liftboat and Jackup Barge
<DESC>The Investment Programs Office of the 46th Test Wing, Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, is seeking information on the availability of mobile maritime self-elevating vessels to be used as operating platforms for tracking sensors (e.g., radars, photo-optic mounts, laser trackers) in support of Department of Defense armament and munitions test and training operations.  The high-fidelity tracking sensors that will be hosted on the vessels, and the resultant precise track data obtained from them, requires that these sensors be operated from very stable operating platforms.  
This Request for Information (RFI) is intended to solicit information pertaining to two specific types of mobile maritime self-elevating vessels; those that are self-propelled (liftboats) and those that are towed to their operating locations (jackup barges, MODUs, MOPUs, etc.).  Additionally, information regarding any other type of vessel or platform that approximates, meets, or exceeds the operational capabilities criteria described in this RFI is also encouraged.  Thus, it is the intent of this RFI to address three general categories of vessel or platform: 1) liftboats; 2) jackups; and, 3) other.
Due to the intended purpose and desired operating environment of the vessels addressed by this RFI, any vessel considered must meet or exceed the following requirements:  a) be capable of conducting elevated-deck operations in a water depth of at least 150 feet (with a 20-foot air gap); b) be capable of accommodating a maximum deck load (including full consumables) of at least 250,000 pounds; c) have open/usable deck area of at least 2,000 square feet; d) have pad, leg, and hull design/construction suitable for sustained operations on the seabed and in the waters of the Gulf of Mexico (off the coast of Florida); e) have properly functioning primary systems (e.g., engine(s), generator(s), jacking system, sewage treatment system, heating and air conditioning system, navigation and communications equipment, galley, appliances, etc.); f) have accommodations and facilities sufficient to support berthing of at least 12 persons.  
The above listed requirements constitute the minimum acceptable criteria.  Responses pertaining to vessels exceeding these parameters (e.g., larger decks, heavier loads, deeper operating depths) are encouraged.
In responding to this RFI the following information, if available, should be included:  1) list vessel certifications, if any (e.g., USCG 46CFR Subchapter L (unrestricted), ABS Class, Lloyd Class, Loadline Certificate, etc.); 2) hull design/type; 3) pad, leg, and jacking system design/type and specifications (e.g., number, length, and width of legs and pads, jacking speed, wave height limits during jacking, leg tower height above deck, etc.); 4) year and location built; 5) year and location refurbished, if applicable; 6) maximum operating depth with specified air gap; 7) vessel?s current location and availability for inspection; 8) hull dimensions; 9) overall deck dimensions; 10) usable deck area in square feet; 11) maximum deck load with full consumables; 12) maximum draft; 13) vessel net/gross tonnage; 14) engine specifications; 15) vessel running speed; 16) generator specifications; 17) fuel and potable water storage capacities; 18) heliport specifications, if applicable; 19) cranes specifications; 20) description of personnel accommodations and facilities; 21) description of communication, navigation, and electronic equipment; 22) winches; 23) lifeboats; 24) information regarding other pertinent equipment or attributes; 25) photographs and/or detailed drawings of deck(s) and/or accommodations.
Additionally, the vessel owner (or designated sales agent) must state the desired selling price of the vessel, including delivery costs assuming end-user acceptance at destination (offshore of either Eglin or Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida).
At this time the Government is merely exploring the availability and costs of suitable mobile self-elevating vessels to be used as offshore instrumentation platforms.  This request for information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as a request for proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.  The Government does not plan to award a contract based on the responses from this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs of charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this RFI or the Government's use of such information.  The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any contractor's input resulting from this RFI.  This RFI does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract.  No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this contemplated effort.  The information you provide may be utilized by the Air Force in developing its acquisition strategy and in its Statement of Work/Statement of Objectives and Performance Specifications.  The information resulting from this RFI may be included in one or more RFPs, which will be released to industry.  Industry is encouraged to respond with information not constrained by proprietary data rights.  However, if proprietary data is included in your reply, please mark it appropriately.  Any subsequent actions resulting from the evaluation of the information provided because of this RFI may be synopsized at a future date.  If synopsized, information detailing the specific requirements of this procurement(s) will be included.  Replies to this RFI should be sent to the Investment Programs Office.  Address your replies as follows: 46th Test Wing/TSRST, 205 West D Ave, Ste. 125,  Eglin AFB, FL 32542-5641, Attn: Chris Snider.  Additional technical information may be obtained from Chris Snider, (850) 882-4481, ext. 523.
