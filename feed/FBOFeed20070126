<DESC>The scope of this project requires the contractor to furnish all supervision, plant, labor, materials, tools, and equipment to stabilize the sea coastal borders of a portion of a closed landfill.  The work includes, but is not limited to:  Repair of approximately 120 meters of coastal shoreline to prevent errosion and improve esthetic appearance.  The work includes excavation and inspection for contamination of approximately 2900 cubic meters of excess soil from the seafloor and beachfront; installation of approximately 3700 square meters geotextile fabric with estimated 14,500 cubic meters basaltic rock coverage which the contractor will be required to blast, crush and transport from a nearby quarry; and some leveling and earthwork to the landfills themselves.  The location of Thule Air Base limits exterior work to the months of June through September, although work is sometimes possible in May or October.  Additionally, Thule Air Base's location demands that all supplies/personnel must be shipped/transported in/out via air/sealift.  Thule Air Base is not a commercial air/sea port and there is no other access. Shipping schedules are dictated by Defense contracts, and materials and labor are not available locally.  The estimated magnitude of this project is between $500,000 and $1,000,000.  This project is one of six separate and distinct phases of work, the first of which was completed in 2006.  The performance period for this phase is 365 days.  There is a 245 calendar day winter exclusionary period from 15 September to 15 May wherein no work will be permitted.  This period is included in the total performance period.  Actual construction is expected to take 60-90 days.Price-Performance Tradeoff (PPT) shall be used as the method of evaluation.   It is anticipated the solicitation documents, including specifications and drawings, shall be posted electronically on or about 23 February 2007 with offers due 30 days thereafter.

Description:  The Ram Air Control Valve is part of the aircraft Environmental Control System (ECS).  This valve modulates the ram air flowing through the pre-cooler heat exchanger in response to current signals from the temperature controller.  The variation in the current maintains bleed air temperature downstream of the pre-cooler heat exchanger to a predetermined constant value.  This results in a controlled bleed air temperature downstream of the heat exchanger that is within safe operating parameters of the downstream components.  The Ram Air Flow Control Valve consists of an actuator, inseparable air duct assembly, left and right hand doors, electrical harness assembly, and servo control valve. 
Destination:  Shipping instruction to be given by PMS. 
Required Delivery:  3 EA, every thirty days ARO until order is complete.

Under the authority of FAR 6.302, the proposed contract action is for supplies/services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources.

However, all proposals received within 30 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm listed.

<CONTACT>Noelle Spalding, 937-255-3385 x3108
<DESC>NOTICE OF CONTRACT ACTION, 26 Jan 07, ASC/XR and the 646 AESS (Aeronautical Systems Squadron) at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH intend to  solicit Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL),  Laurel, MD 20723-6099 for an increase in contract ceiling of $5,000,000 to  provide continued technical analysis and systems engineering support for  the Airborne Electronic Attack (AEA) system of systems (SoS) concept  development and other Air Force Electronic Warfare (EW) projects, as  required. JHU/APL has unique credentials based on their extensive  experience in EW analyses, systems engineering support, and independent  assessment ability supplied over the years to the Navy EA-6B/EA-18G and  the Air Force EF-111 Electronic Attack (EA) platforms and numerous studies  and analyses for DoD EW programs. This Notice of Contract Action is  published to notify potential subcontractors that the AF anticipates  negotiating a contract modification to existing contract FA8626-04-D-2063  on a sole-source basis to JHU/APL in March 2007. This notice of intent is  not a request for competitive proposals. Information received will be  considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a  competitive procurement. The proposed contract action is for services for  which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source  under the authority of FAR 6.302. The Air Force anticipates modifying the  existing Johns Hopkins University/Applied Physics Lab (JHU/APL) IDIQ  contract on a CPFF basis with a not to exceed a total $15M ceiling value  (i.e. $5,000,000 ceiling increase). An approved system for storing and  managing Top Secret material is required under this effort. The Government  does not contemplate providing any equipment or data under this contract.  It is anticipated that JHU/APL will provide analysis and engineering  service support to the AEA SoS. The AEA Capability includes standoff  support jamming, recoverable and expendable stand-in support jamming, and  mod escort jamming; as well as appropriate network interconnectivity and  local electronic warfare battle management between and among the SoS  elements for the employment of the AEA capability.

<CONTACT>Hugh Harrison (301)227-1123
<DESC>The Underwater Shock Analysis Branch, Code 661, of the Carderock Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWCCD) has been tasked by the Office of the Secretary of Defense to provide a demonstration of the air gun technology developed by Weidlinger Associates under a SBIR Phase II effort. NSWCCD intends to negotiate a non-competitive procurement under Simplified Acquisition Procedures with the Weidlinger Associates , New York, NY 10014;  under the authority of  10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B)(i), substantial duplication of cost to the United States which is not expected to be recovered through competition. Under the SBIR Phase II effort, Weidlinger Associates developed an innovative method that utilizes arrays of high pressure air guns to deliver an “UNDEX like” shock pulse to a target vessel. Weidlinger has demonstrated this method against one of the United Kingdom’s shock barges as well as a United States Navy Floating Shock Platform (FSP). Weidlinger Assoiciates will be performing a final demonstration against the US Navy’s FSP as required by the SBIR phase II effort. Representatives of the Office of the Secretary of Defense desire to have Weidlinger Associates perform a demonstration of their air gun technology against the SMTV immediately following the upcoming FSP demonstration. Developing and implementing the gun firing control system and air gun arrays requires a deep understanding of the technology and would result in a substantial duplication of cost and effort to the Government for another organization to obtain the knowledge and experience necessary to perform the !  desired services. All responsible sources submitting offers will be considered.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties may forward their capabilities statements to the Government POC on or before 2/9/2007.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City, FL intends to award a Sole Source purchase order to Prizm Advanced Communications Electronics Inc. (Prizm Inc) of 6655-R Amberton Dr, Elkridge MD 21075-6203 for analysis and design of an electro-optical slip ring at the OK-520 winch interface for the AN/SQQ-32 High Frequency Wide Band (HFWB) Sonar upgrade requirement to facilitate telemetry data transmissions via the new Fiber Optic Tow Cable (FOTC).  The HFWB slip ring requires a minimum of a six optical channels for data telemetry and dual redundancy applications.  This purchase is not suitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. Prizm currently has an available COTS seven channel single mode Fiber Optic Rotary Joint (FORJ), (PN CK 7206-0131) that has an optical loss of less than 2.5db per fiber and is capable of supporting data rates of 1.2GB per second, which is a HFWB requirement.  They have completed preliminary modification of this COTS item to !  the HFWB requirements. This order will provide for the final development of the FORJ PN CK 7206-0131 Mod X slip ring to the HFWB requirements.  Prism's experience and knowledge of the HFWB slip ring requirements and optical budget is paramount in furthering this development and engineering a working prototype slip ring for the HFWB system to the Fleet in the time allotted.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:

Part I: Background information and description of requirements:

The technology from Xenogen, in vivo imaging, enables investigators to track cells and visualize and quantify light output from expressed genes within an intact model animal, in real-time. Specimens may be studied longitudinally during experimental disease without having to be terminated, thus specimens serve as their own controls and numbers used in research may be potentially reduced.  The instrument enables multiple investigators to utilize or plan experiments aimed at understanding mechanisms of metastasis and cell tracking in vivo.  

Benefit

The results of such studies, as mentioned above, are expected to yield new information regarding ways to interrupt, prevent and otherwise treat the spread of cancer.  In addition, it is highly likely that the identification of novel biomarkers applicable to patient diagnostics will result.  For example, preliminary studies are underway to correlate novel biomarkers from human ovarian cancer with the cancer burden, using optical imaging instrumentation.  These are expected to permit the filing of intellectual property claims based upon research performed with this instrument.  Ancillary benefits include longitudinal experiments to be conducted resulting in the potential to reduce the number of research animals needed for such studies. 

Part II: Facts and Reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition: 

Statutory Authority: 13.106-1 (b) and 13.501-(a)(1)

(b) Soliciting from a single source.

(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization). 

(2) For sole source acquisitions of commercial items in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold conducted pursuant to subpart 13.5, the requirements at 13.501(a) apply.

<SUBJECT>A -- Research for Inhalation Toxicology of Environmental Chemicals
<SOLNBR>NIH-ES-06-05
<RESPDATE>062606
<CONTACT>Carolyn Flowers, Contract Specialist, Phone 919-541-0425, Fax 919-541-2712, Email flowers3@niehs.nih.gov - Denise Tyre, Procurement Technician, Phone 919-316-4686, Fax 919-541-2712, Email tyre@niehs.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) is soliciting proposals for the purpose of operating the Respiratory Toxicology Group (RTOX) inhalation facility  and performing animal studies. This includes setting up the inhalation facility in a suitable building provided by the contractor; conducting the daily operation of the exposure facility; operating an animal facility; and conducting studies as directed by study protocols. 
 
The mandatory qualification criteria of the inhalation facility being located within 15 minutes driving time of the NIEHS main campus, 111 T.W. Alexander Drive, Research Triangle Park, NC  27709 must be met at the time of award. 
  
Anticipated Solicitation release date is May 8, 2006.  

The contractor shall provide 1) an inhalation exposure facility and staff dedicated exclusively to the support of NIEHS studies; 2) on-site space for the NIEHS Respiratory Toxicology Group  which is independently secured from the rest of the facility; and  3) all components of the Inhalation Facility and the support areas including offices and laboratories shall be located on one site.  

The technical capabilities of the inhalation exposure facility have been tailored specifically to support the research needs of the Respiratory Toxicology Group and other groups within the Institute.  Flexibility is a major factor in the design and operation of the exposure facility.  The specific types of inhalation studies to be performed will be entirely dependent on the Institute’s needs for inhalation research.  Exposure systems have been designed to allow configuration for a variety of study designs with a minimum of custom modifications. Computer control of exposures provides a safe, well controlled, and well-documented exposure environment.  The contractor shall maintain complete and up-to-date documentation of all technical aspects of the facility design and operations.  
An inhalation facility is composed of four (4) distinct work areas - exposure, animal care, technical support, and staff areas. 

For estimating purposes the facility should include the following:
Total approximate facility space = 13,000 square feet which include the following:  (note: a. through o. below are minimums which do not equal total approximate facility space)
a.	RTOX space – Three (3) office spaces of 150 square feet each; 60 square feet of space for file cabinets; wet lab space furnished as biochemical laboratory 1 room (400 square feet); cell culture laboratory (200 square feet), equipment storage area (100 square feet);]
b.	Eight (8) exposure rooms totaling 2618 square feet; 
c.	Minimum of fifteen (15) animal housing rooms totaling 2160 square feet; 
d.	Two (2) necropsy rooms totaling 500 square feet; 
e.	200 square feet for surgery/special procedures; 
f.	Two (2) change/locker rooms, clean/dirty access totaling 800 square feet; 
g.	500 square feet for equipment wash area; 
h.	100 square feet for chemical preparation area; 
i.	400 square feet for analytical chemistry support laboratory;
j.	400 square feet for biochemical instrumentation laboratory;
k.	300 square feet for electronics laboratory;
l.	150 square feet for ADP work area;  
m.	2450 square feet storage space; 
n.	240 square feet for animal care staff room; 
o.	Five (5) offices of 150 square feet each (750 sq ft).  
Note:  Approval of final configuration of the facility rests with the government.

The contractor shall maintain compliance with Federal, State and Local laws, and NIH regulations such as the following:  1)The Laboratory Animal Welfare Act of 1966 (P.L. 89-544 as amended in 1970, 1976, and 1985) http://www.nal.usda.gov;  2) Standard Operating Procedures for Laboratory Animal Management that conform to the most recent versions of PHS and other public guidance. 3) NIH Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW); 4) Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC); 5) NIEHS Laboratory Health and Safety Minimum Requirement for Contractors; 6) “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” (NRC, 1996); 7) FDA “Good Laboratory Practices for Nonclinical Laboratory Studies” (CFR 21 Part 85)

It is anticipated the resulting cost-reimbursement, level-of-effort contract will be for a period of four (4) year and three (3), two (2)-year option periods. For estimating purposes the Government estimated the level-of effort at 43,524 direct labor hours per year as follows:  Professional – 9579 direct labor hours ;Technical - 7440 direct labor hours); Animal Husbandry Staff – 26,040 direct labor hours; Administrative Support - 465 direct labor hours. 

The specific studies will be designed based on research requirements originating within the NIEHS.  It is not possible to anticipate the specific projects in advance. 
A.  	The following describe the anticipated nature of the work. 
1.	The contractor shall be prepared to conduct whole-body inhalation exposure to 2 different gases (24 hours per day for up to 4 consecutive days), nose-only exposures to one liquid aerosol (30 minute exposure per group, three groups per day for up to seven days), whole body exposure to a second liquid aerosol (180 minute exposure per group, three groups per day, twice per week for up to two weeks), non-inhalation (e.g. single oropharyngeal aspiration) exposure to 1 or 2 chemicals.  These studies may run simultaneously and consecutively.  It shall be necessary to conduct several studies while simultaneously preparing the other exposure rooms for exposures to begin immediately after one of the ongoing exposures is completed. 
2.	Mice and rats will be the primary test species.  A large number of genetically-modified mouse strains will be used.  Provisions should be available for use of immuno-compromised animals, and for occasional breeding of one or two mouse strains.
3.	Dose Animals
The principal route of treatment is by inhalation, either whole body or nose only. The exposure regimen may be six (6) hours per day, five (5) days per week, excluding holidays. For studies involving extensive sample collection, exposures of some animals shall be staggered by one day; in these cases exposures shall be conducted six (6) days per week.  Exposures of six (6) hours per day duration shall be completed by 2:30 P.M. so that animals will be available for use by NIEHS researchers after the daily exposure.  Special studies may require exposures of longer duration or on weekends and holidays.
A continuous 23.5 hours/day exposure regimen for up to four (4) days/week shall be necessary for some studies.  Because these exposures must run unattended at night, the appropriate remote monitoring systems must be in place to ensure that personnel are notified immediately if any deviations in airflow or chemical concentrations occur. 
Studies may require treatment by intratracheal instillation, oropharyngeal aspiration, gavage, injection, implants, dermal exposure, feed, or drinking water.

	4.  	Collection of Data and Samples
The data and biological sample collection requirements will be specified in each research protocol.  Requirements in recent studies have included:
	a. 	weekly or bi-weekly collection of body weights and in-life observations on each animal using an automated weighing system
	b.	performing necropsies associated with terminal sacrifices or moribund sacrifices. 
	c.	whole body perfusion with fixative.
	d.	collection of blood from a jugular cannula, cardiac puncture, or orbital bleeding (for kinetic studies multiple samples shall be collected during and after exposure)
	e.	collection of tissues for biochemical analysis, or histopathological evaluation.
	f.	collection of tissues for DNA or RNA isolation.
	g.	collection of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from mice and rats.

	5.	The contractor shall measure some experimental endpoints as specified in the research protocols.
In all cases the PO will provide the experimental design in a project protocol. 
The contractor shall be responsible for the animal handling and shall provide the expertise in the operation of the analytical equipment necessary to conduct the measurements. 
The specific end points to be measured shall depend on the needs of the government. These measurements require the setup, calibration, and routine operation of analytical equipment including gas chromatographs (GC's), unrestrained plethysmographs, blood gas analyzer, plate readers, and a high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) system. Endpoints may include but are not limited to:
a.	the analysis of samples of tissues and biological materials for indigenous compounds, the exposure compound and it’s metabolites. 
b.	pulmonary function measurements (Buxco system)
c.	the loading by particulates and the effect on pulmonary clearance mechanisms
d.	enzyme activity in tissues or biological fluids
e.	blood gas measurements in rats and mice
f.	blood hemoglobin, oxyhemoglobin, carboxyhemoglobin measurements in rats and mice.

The contract will include Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) such as computers and specialized inhalation equipment.

Contractor provided material shall include genetically altered rats/mice; general office supplies; animal supplies such as tyvek suits,feed, and bedding; all anesthetics, drugs and controlled substances used in veterinary medicine.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The contractor will be expected to provide non-personal services for systems engineering and technical assistance in support of the Mission and Function Statements for the USASMDC/ARSTRAT and Other Government Agencies related to air,  space, and/or missile defense.  This support is both broad ranging and ever changing.  The SETAC scope of work (SOW) is anticipated to have ten (10) functional areas:  (1) Requirements Definition, Integration, and Planning; (2) Technology Development, Sys tem Development, Assessment, and Validation; (3) Threat Estimation/Projections; (4) Weapons Lethality and Effects Estimation; (5) Modeling, Simulation and Interfacing; (6) Program/Project Analysis, Evaluation, Experimentation, and Support; (7) Production a nd Fielding Support; (8) Homeland Defense and Homeland Security; (9) Warfighter Support; and 10) Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear.

This acquisition will result in multiple award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts with identical SOWs and numbers of Direct Productive Person-Hours (DPPHs).  The contracts will consist of fixed-price labor categories and cost reimbur sable travel and materials line items.   The period of performance for the resultant acquisition will be five(5)-year Basic contract and there will be an option provision for the possibility of five (5) one-year extensions to the basic period of performance.  The Government is planning to include  the five (5) one-year options in the event that the statutory language preventing advisory and assistance services (A&AS) contracts from exceeding five years is revised within the basic contract period of performance. It is anticipated that the requiremen ts will be executed via task orders issued, based on actual customer requirements.  The resultant contract will contain an organizational conflict of interest (OCI) clause that could limit a successful proposer from participating in any other SMDC contract.

<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is soliciting proposals for the National Guidelines and Quality Measures Clearinghouses from offerors who have the capability to migrate, operate, maintain, enhance, and evaluate two existing yet related AHRQ Internet repositories of evidence-based information and associated companion materials These are: the National Guideline Clearinghouse (TM) (NGC), www.guideline.gov, for evidence-based clinical practice guidelines; and the National Quality Measures Clearinghouse(TM) (NQMC), www.qualitymeasures.ahrq.gov, for evidence-based quality measures and measure sets. These Web resources have a database-backend, are indexed and searchable, and adhere to Health on the Net (HON) code ethics. Relationships between the two databases and Web sites that have already been established will be maintained. For this solicitation, each repository will retain its unique URL and name.

Content in NGC and NQMC is presented in a standardized format using a template of attributes specific to each Clearinghouse. This format permits side-by-side comparison of database content online. All guidelines in NGC and all quality measures in NQMC meet specific inclusion criteria. NGC has two additional content items: syntheses and Annotated Bibliographies. NQMC has browse features not available in NGC.  NGC has search features not available in NQMC. This requirement is content driven supported by information technology.  While there are information technology components in the requirement, it is not IT driven. Content on both the NGC and NQMC must be evaluated against evidence-based practice standards separate and apart from IT standards.

The goal of these two Clearinghouses is to provide physicians, nurses, and other health professionals, health care providers, health plans, integrated delivery systems, purchasers and others an accessible mechanism for obtaining objective, detailed information on clinical practice guidelines and quality measures and to further their dissemination, implementation and use in order to inform health care decisions.

This requirement will develop, deploy and maintain the processes and systems to collect, abstract, index, publish, update and archive clinical practice guidelines and quality measures. Implementation or evaluation tools associated with the submitted guidelines or measures will be identified and shared as potential content with AHRQ?s QualityTools Contractor. The guidelines and measures will be evaluated, extracted, entered and stored in a database; they will be posted to the existing Web sites. 

Early in this requirement?s life cycle, the Contractor will make recommendations to AHRQ on enhancements to each Web site (content, functionality, design), and following a systems development life cycle and configuration management plan, conduct usability tests, and through an iterative process refine the enhancements, test, eventually deploy, operate, maintain and assess customer satisfaction. 

Related content tasks include establishing a single expert panel and a single editorial board with capacity to offer guidance to both projects, propose revisions to the established content inclusion criteria and templates of attributes. The expert panel will guide the Clearinghouses on broad project areas, and will participate in approval of revisions to the inclusion criteria and standardized template. 

The Editorial Board will work with the content teams in key aspects of content development and production, such as, but not limited to, reviewing submissions against the inclusion criteria and judging how new or emerging knowledge in the clinical practice guideline and quality measurement fields could be acted upon.  The Editorial Board will also serve to assist in the development of recommendations on what information to seek from submitters in an online submission form (not currently available) and on how to enhance the user?s experience with the content currently posted, fill content gaps, and manage posting of user comments to the Web site, including responses from relevant guideline or measure developer organizations much like that done for scientific journals. 

The Web sites shall continue to be user-centered and meet requirements of the E-Government Act of 2002, including ensuring information quality, following Department of Health and Human Services -wide policies, communicating with the public and following the Paperwork Reduction Act, using the approved domains, implementing security controls, protecting privacy, maintaining accessibility, and managing records and documentation. 

Proposals must  demonstrate expertise in developing, appraising, implementing and using evidence-based clinical practice guidelines and quality measures; developing or evaluating and integrating informatics in efforts related to health services research, clinical practice guidelines or quality measures; expertise in indexing using the National Library of Medicine?s Unified Medical Language System; complex database and government Web-site development and maintenance; and, managing and working with expert panels and editorial boards. In addition, Sources must demonstrate expertise in developing and managing complex content driven projects under tight timelines.  

Proposals must demonstrate personnel are seasoned professionals with education and proven experience with successful results in areas such as development, implementation, use, and evaluation of clinical practice guidelines and quality measures; development of clinically related classifications schemes and use of National Library of Medicine?s Unified Medical Language system; working with developers of clinical practice guidelines and quality measure, as well as, clinical organizations, including but not limited to hospitals, health plans, and medical specialty societies; completing highly technical and complex projects; migrating and constructing large relational databases; migrating and developing user-friendly Government Web sites. A  PMI?certified or PMI-certification-eligible Project Manager is required as well as a demonstrated ability to provide EVM information.  
 
It is anticipated that the procurement will be on a cost reimbursable basis for a six-year period of performance (three year base with one three-year option).  For information purposes, the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code applicable is 516110 Internet Publishing and Broadcasting (500 people).  The successful offeror will comply with the DHHS/ AHRQ small business subcontracting goals set forth in the Request for Proposal.

In addition to the solicitation being available on this site, it will be available for downloading from the internet on AHRQ?s site at www.ahrq.gov   Once in AHRQ?s homepage go to ?Funding Opportunities?, then to ?Contracts?, and then to ?Request for Proposal (RFP)?. It is the offerors responsibility to monitor this site for release of the solicitation, download their own copy of the solicitation, and to monitor this site for any subsequent amendments. It is estimated that the solicitation will be issued on/about January 26, 2007 with proposals due April 24, 2007.

<DESC>The scope of this project requires the contractor to furnish all supervision, plant, labor, materials, tools, and equipment to stabilize the sea coastal borders of a portion of a closed landfill.  The work includes, but is not limited to:  Repair of approximately 120 meters of coastal shoreline to prevent errosion and improve esthetic appearance.  The work includes excavation and inspection for contamination of approximately 2900 cubic meters of excess soil from the seafloor and beachfront; installation of approximately 3700 square meters geotextile fabric with estimated 14,500 cubic meters basaltic rock coverage which the contractor will be required to blast, crush and transport from a nearby quarry; and some leveling and earthwork to the landfills themselves.  The location of Thule Air Base limits exterior work to the months of June through September, although work is sometimes possible in May or October.  Additionally, Thule Air Base's location demands that all supplies/personnel must be shipped/transported in/out via air/sealift.  Thule Air Base is not a commercial air/sea port and there is no other access. Shipping schedules are dictated by Defense contracts, and materials and labor are not available locally.  The estimated magnitude of this project is between $500,000 and $1,000,000.  This project is one of six separate and distinct phases of work, the first of which was completed in 2006.  The performance period for this phase is 365 days.  There is a 245 calendar day winter exclusionary period from 15 September to 15 May wherein no work will be permitted.  This period is included in the total performance period.  Actual construction is expected to take 60-90 days.Price-Performance Tradeoff (PPT) shall be used as the method of evaluation.   It is anticipated the solicitation documents, including specifications and drawings, shall be posted electronically on or about 23 February 2007 with offers due 30 days thereafter. Any and all amendments shall be likewise posted.  This solicitation and award is restricted in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(4) International Agreement, to US, Danish and Greenlandic firms.  No hard-copies of the solicitation will be distributed. Offerors are required to be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (see www.ccr.gov).

Description:  The Ram Air Control Valve is part of the aircraft Environmental Control System (ECS).  This valve modulates the ram air flowing through the pre-cooler heat exchanger in response to current signals from the temperature controller.  The variation in the current maintains bleed air temperature downstream of the pre-cooler heat exchanger to a predetermined constant value.  This results in a controlled bleed air temperature downstream of the heat exchanger that is within safe operating parameters of the downstream components.  The Ram Air Flow Control Valve consists of an actuator, inseparable air duct assembly, left and right hand doors, electrical harness assembly, and servo control valve. 
Destination:  Shipping instruction to be given by PMS. 
Required Delivery:  3 EA, every thirty days ARO until order is complete.

Electronic procedure will be used for this solicitation. Note:  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 736-3273.  DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. Request for Written Quotation will be issued.  The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within forty five-days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed. Specifications, plans, or drawings relating to the procurement described are incomplete or not available and cannot be furnished by the Government. See Note(s) 26.

The contract is contemplated to be for 3 years with 3 award term options. The contract will not exceed 10 years. The granting of the award term will be based upon improved reliability and program management. The Government will negotiate on a sole source basis with Honeywell Inc as they have rights to the drawings for the items to be included in the service.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Advanced Displays for the Visualization of Geospatial-Intelligence
<SOLNBR>RFI06
<RESPDATE>020207

<CONTACT>Tracie Flora, Contracting Specialist, Phone 703-755-5352, Fax 703-755-5601, Email Tracie.L.Flora@nga.mil
<DESC>1. DESCRIPTION. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) is seeking industry feedback on current and future advanced display technologies.  The purpose of the RFI is to gather industry-wide feedback on current and upcoming display technologies that can view flicker-free stereoscopic imagery and exhibit smooth and continuous, blur-free roam capabilities.

2. NOTICE. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes, it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Furthermore, the Government is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested parties? expense.   Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in a future RFP, if one is issued.

3. BACKGROUND. NGA provides timely, relevant, and accurate geospatial-intelligence in support of national security objectives. Geospatial-intelligence is the exploitation and analysis of imagery and geospatial information to describe, assess, and visually depict physical features and geographically referenced activities on the Earth. The NGA mission requires the display of softcopy geospatial data in both monoscopic and stereoscopic viewing modes with high resolution and image quality.  NGA currently utilizes high-resolution Cathode-Ray Tube (CRT) monitors to provide continuous blur-free motion roam functionality and view stereoscopic image pairs. Monochrome CRT displays have historically been used for panchromatic imagery exploitation owing to their excellent sharpness and high dynamic range, enabling the observer to distinguish details in the imagery.  Color CRT displays have historically been used for color imagery exploitation and presentation of color text and graphics. Geospatial-intelligence analysts use specialized COTS image viewer applications such as RemoteView, SOCET SET/GXP, ERDAS Imagine, ENVI, and Image Scout while exploiting and analyzing imagery in stereo and in roaming the image.  CRT monitors perform exceptionally well in the area of image roam performance.  CRT roam is a smooth and continuous panning motion directed by the geospatial-intelligence analyst through large-area images.  Blur-free image motion enables the analyst to detect faint target objects of interest while searching through the image.  The addition of an active polarizing filter and passive polarized glasses allows analysts to resolve two images from a stereo pair into a true stereoscopic image.


4. INFORMATION REQUEST. NGA is requesting information on desktop display technologies that can exhibit capabilities of smooth continuous, blur-free motion roam and/or flicker-free stereoscopic image pairs.  NGA is interested in what technologies that meet or exceed these capabilities are currently available, what technologies that meet or exceed these capabilities are being planned, and the timeframe when technologies that meet or exceed these capabilities are planned to be available. Interested parties are requested to submit the following information for each display technology on the provided Display Technology Submission Form, attached to a cover letter with points of contact (POCs).

Single or Multiple screen display
In/Near Production or Prototype
Display Type (IPS or PVA LCD, Plasma, etc.)
Color or Grayscale (color gamut or whitepoint)
Luminance Response
Calibration (Integrated photo sensors, 10-bit look-up tables, user-defined aim, remote access)
Pixel response time (msec)
Pixel density (pixels per inch)
Pixel format (Minimum of 1920 x 1200)
Refresh rate (Minimum 60 Hz per eye for flicker-free stereo)
Roam rate (Minimum 750 pixels/second)
Display Size (Minimum 20 inches diagonal)
Dimensions (W x H x D)
Power consumption (watts)
Lifetime (Minimum 25,000 hours)
Mean Time Before Failure (MTBF)
Projected price per unit ($)
Projected availability (currently available, 1-3 months, etc.)
Available for Demo (yes/no)
	
NGA recognizes that vendors can provide other pertinent information to distinguish their products, and are encouraged to do so. For example, a minimum of 60Hz refresh rate (per image) is considered necessary for Cathode Ray Tubes (CRTs) to display flicker-free stereoscopic image pairs, though other means may be used in flat panels to achieve the desired result while having a refresh rate less than 60 Hz.

5. SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS. Interested parties are requested to complete the display technology information submission form no later than 02 February 2007 to Tracie.L.Flora@nga.mil or fax it to 703-755-5601.  The submission form and the softcopy exploitation display hardware performance standard guidelines will be posted on www.nga.mil under Business Opportunities.  

6. POINT OF CONTACT. Questions regarding this announcement shall be submitted in writing by e-mail to Robert Crain, Robert.C.Crain@nga.mil, and Arthur Cobb, Arthur.L.Cobb@nga.mil.

7. SUMMARY. This RFI is to obtain useful market information concerning desktop flat panel display technology currently in production, in R&D or in future plans.

Original Announcement:
The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is interested in identifying Small Business organizations with requisite qualifications to assist with the conduct of two large scale nationally-representative school-based surveys on adolescent health behavior.  The Prevention Research Branch (PRB), an intramural research group of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), conducts research on child and adolescent health behavior.  One of the PRB areas of emphasis is assessment of the prevalence and determinants of health behavior among adolescents.  Toward this end, the PRB plans to conduct two surveys beginning in the 2009-2010 school year: a cross-sectional national probability survey of U.S. 6th-10th graders that is also consistent with the requirements of the international Health Behavior in School-aged Children (HBSC) survey; and a 4-year longitudinal survey of independent national probability samples of U.S. 11-year-old and 15-year-old students.

The HBSC survey is conducted among national or regional samples of students at ages 11, 13, and 15 in about 40 countries.  The cross-sectional international HBSC survey requires at least 1536 youth in each age group and a total of 5000 students.  The goal of the cross-sectional HBSC survey is to obtain data about adolescent health behavior and to make this information available so as to enable the improvement of health services and programs for youth. The goals of the cross-sectional U.S. survey are to provide health behavior information about adolescents nationally (U.S.-specific protocol) and to enable international comparisons by incorporating the mandatory HBSC protocol.

The U.S. longitudinal survey requires a probability sample that will permit estimates of population percentages with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points at the 95% confidence level for each age. The goals of the U.S. longitudinal survey include: to identify the trajectory of adolescent health behaviors from pre-adolescence through the post high school year; to examine the predictors of the onset of key adolescent risk behaviors during this period; to identify family, school, and social/environmental factors that promote or sustain positive health behaviors; and to identify transition points in health risk behaviors and changes in family, school, and social/environmental precursors to these transitions.

Surveys consistent with the cross-sectional HBSC were conducted in the U.S. in 1997-1998, 2001-2002, and 2005-2006. In international comparisons, previous HBSC surveys showed that U.S. 15-year-old youth are less likely to smoke than students in most other countries surveyed, even though 13-year-old US students experiment with tobacco in comparable proportions to youth in other countries.  U.S. youth are more likely to be overweight than students in the other HBSC countries.  U.S. eating habits were also shown to be less healthy with a comparatively high proportion of youth consuming high fat foods and soft drinks with sugar.  Analyses of the U.S. national data set have addressed bullying, unintentional injury, behaviors related to obesity, and utilization of health care.  
            
The 2009-2010 U.S. surveys will address health-related factors according to rigorous protocols to be developed by the HBSC by June of 2009, and should also include additional factors and dimensions that are relevant to the U.S. experience.  To be deemed capable, a small business must demonstrate their ability to: 1)  develop a school-based, national probability sampling plan that would provide a nationally-representative sample, including appropriate over-sampling of racial minority students; 2) employ contacts

The Southwestern Region refers to the geographic area encompassed by the IMA/Southwest Regional Office (AR, AZ, CA, LA, NM, NV, OK, and TX).  It is anticipated that a large portion of the work will be at Fort Bliss, TX.   FOR INFORMATION ONLY: This contract is required by Army initiatives under the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC), the integrated Global Presence and Basing Strategy (IGPBS), and the Army Modular Force (AMF) program, although the projects may be required f rom any Military Program.  The Army must posture facilities to effectively orient combat capabilities where they can most effectively organize, train, and deploy to support ongoing operations worldwide.  The execution of the work under the Military Constru ction Program will be accomplished using a product line concept for the facilities.  The product line concept will be used for the construction of barracks, dining facilities, company operation facilities, headquarters buildings, vehicle maintenance shops,  unit and ammunition storage facilities, aviation facilities, equipment parking areas, and other features of the program.  Under the product line concept, Districts in the Corps of Engineers Southwestern and South Pacific Divisions will be assigned one or two facility types and will be responsible for awarding Design-Build IDIQ contracts for their assigned type of facility (product line).  When there is a requirement for their facility type, each District product line team will scope, negotiate, and award a  task order to deliver the required facilities to the Program Office assigned to manage the overall project. The District product line team will assist with the administration of the task order to include design reviews, submittals, and modifications.  The  design/build contractor for each product line will be responsible for maintaining current documents and incorporating into future task orders changes in army criteria as well as, modification, and clarification identified in ongoing task orders.

PROJECT INFORMATION: The U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense (USAMRICD), an organization of the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC), is charged with the development, testing, and evaluation of medical treatment s and materiel to prevent and treat casualties of chemical warfare agents. Its missio n includes fundamental and applied research in the pharmacology, physiology, toxicology, pathology, and biochemistry of chemical agents and their medical countermeasures. In addition to research, the Institute educates health care providers in the medical management of chemical and biological agent casualties. The USAMRICD supports a Chemical/Biological Rapid Response Team (C/B-RRT), supports and trains theater Army medical laboratory personnel, and maintains a unique chemical surety facility. The Institute  plays a key role in the Department of Defense (DoD) as the only medical laboratory in the DoD equipped to safely study highly hazardous chemical agents. This project will design the replacement, expansion, and renovation of the existing USAMRICD facilitie s, and will provide the facilities capability required to support USAMRICDs expanding chemical defense mission including medical chemical defense product testing and evaluation. The primary facilities will include BSL-2 laboratories including areas for wo rking with chemical agents, biological agents, associated laboratory support spaces; vivarium and vivarium support to include Animal BSL-2 Animal Research and Animal Holding (ABSL-2) for various species including non-human primates; administrative; support  space; and a central energy plant.    To meet USAMRICD mission requirements, A-E services are required to provide design and related services for construction of USAMRICD, a Department of Defense Medical (DODM) facility of approximately 330,000 gross square-feet and the Chemical Biological Def ense Lab (CBDL), a Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) project of approximately 30,000 gross square-feet.  USAMRICD is a chemical agent containment biomedical research laboratory/animal research facility with communications, intrusion detection and fire de tection and reporting systems, automatic building sprinklers, energy monitoring and control systems (EMCS), building information systems. The CBDL facility includes a medical research laboratory, vivarium and has similar functions as USAMRICD. Supporting f acilities include medical gas utilities, conventional utilities (water, sewer, gas, central district chilled water, steam), electrical services (including emergency power generation), paving, walks, parking, fencing, storm drainage, communication and infor mation systems, fire protection and alarm systems, and site improvements that include landscaping and new access drives. The project will also include decommissioning, decontamination and demolition of existing facilities which may include hazardous materi als surveys (including PCBs, radioactive, etc.), asbestos and lead based paint surveys/abatement requirements. The approximately 330,000 gross square foot DODM USAMRICD and 30,000 square foot BRAC CBDL will utilize design-bid-build methodology. For the de sign-bid-build method, complete contract documents and other supporting documents will be required to be prepared and may include multiple phased design packages. Phased design packages will be implemented if the project construction funding cycle is deter mined to be phased. Phased packages will be designed as complete and usable stand alone facilities.  Should the construction funding cycle be determined to incremental, the entire 330,000 square foot DOD Medical facility and the related BRAC 30,000 square foot facility will be designed as one integral complete and usable project. In the unlikely event that the DODM USAMRICD facility is not funded for construction, the related 30,000 square foot BRAC CBDL facility may be constructed using either design-bid-b uild or the design-build method. If the design-build method is selected, bridging documents and a request for proposal, and other supporting documents will be required to be prepared. Both the DODM USAMRICD and BRAC CBDL will be designed in accordance with  Unified Facilities Criteria, UFC 4-510-01 (MIL-HDBK-1191), DoD Minimum Antiterrorism Standards for Buildings UFC 4-01 0-01, CDC-NIH Bio-safety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories 4th Edition, Biological Defense Safety Program AR 385-69 and DA Pamphlet 385-69, Department of the Army Pamphlet 385-61, Toxic Chemical Agent Safety Standards, Army Regulation 50-6, Ch emical Surety, Department of Agricultural Animal Research Services Facilities Design Standards 242.1M dated July 2002, National Research Council Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NRC 1996), National Research Council Occupational Health and Safety in the Care and Use of Research Animals (NRC 1999), the Americans with Disabilities Act and Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADA/ADAAG), Army Regulation 190-59, Chemical Agent Security Program, Army Regulation 50-6, Chemical Sure ty, Army Regulation 190-13, the Army Physical Security Program, DoD Minimum Antiterrorism Standards for Buildings, DoD Security Engineering criteria, and all other required DOD and Army criteria.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) is for the acquisition of various products developed by AdLib Software which make up their PDF/A conversion suite.  This software is required in order to convert native format documents into the PDF/A standard for storage in the official Department of State archive.  The chose of this document format (PDF/A) has been approved by NARA.  This purchase includes a subscription service that includes software fixes, technical support, and new product updates.  The Adlib Software PDF/A application software will be used as an automated conversation tool to convert 300+ different file formats into the approved open standard PDF archive format.  This conversion will allow access to archival documents far into the future and is also approved by NARA (National Archives Records Administration). A search of the internet and technical documents was done to obtain a list of venders that produced enterprise server based products to fulfill this requirement.  This list was narrowed down to three different products.  These products were brought in-house and evaluated. It was determined during this evaluation that the AdLib Software product was the best fit to our requirements for a number of reasons. •	IT-CCB - As SMART moves to deployment all the products that make up the core will have to go through and be approved by the IT-CCB/IA and DS processes by limiting the number of new unknown applications this process will be smoother and quicker to accomplish. •	Ease of use - One of the goals of the evaluation was to find a product that met our requirements and also was easy to install, configure and use. •	Scalability – Currently licensing of the product allows us to add additional conversion servers as we need to meet processing demands without having to purchase additional licenses. •	Cost – This product came in closest to the initial estimates we set aside for the PDF/A solution within SMART.<BR><BR>

The Juniper SA-5000 devices are essential to the State Department’s requirements for maximum protection and utilization of the network security infrastructure on and off site. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s ONE networking infrastructure.<BR><BR>

Currently, there is no dedicated cooling system in the M1A1 Tank.  Crewmembers have no way to reduce the extreme temperatures experienced during the summer months.  The climate control system improvement will be primarily to reduce heat stress and fatigue on the crewmembers by cooling the interior of the tank.  The USMC is interested in any vendor that can take our existing M1A1 tank and incorporate improvements that will result in the ability to cool the crewmembers both when the engine is and is not running.  Any potential vendor must be able to integrate onto a M1A1 without degrading performance of crew members, the engine power-pack, or the ability to fire weapons. All vendors having the capability of meeting these requirements are requested to submit copies of relevant documentation in response to this Request for Information at no cost to the Government.  Written responses should be submitted not later than close of business 15 February 2007.  Firms should also include literature, brochures, and capabilities summaries directly addressing their ability to meet the aforementioned needs.

<DESC>THIS NEW SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE IS ISSUED TO REPLACE AND CORRECT THE PREVIOUS NOTICE, REFERENCE NUMBER NICHD-PRB-SS-2007-08, POSTED ON NOVEMBER 1, 2006 UNDER THE INCORRECT NAICS CODE: 541710 - RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN THE PHYSICAL, ENGINEERING, AND LIFE SCIENCES WITH A SMALL BUSINESS STANDARD SIZE OF 500 EMPLOYEES OR LESS.

THE CORRECT NAICS CODE IS 541720 - RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES AND HUMANITIES WITH A SMALL BUSINESS STANDARD SIZE OF $6.5 MILLION OR LESS.  

The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is interested in identifying Small Business organizations with requisite qualifications to assist with the conduct of two large scale nationally-representative school-based surveys on adolescent health behavior. The Prevention Research Branch (PRB), an intramural research group of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), conducts research on child and adolescent health behavior. One of the PRB areas of emphasis is assessment of the prevalence and determinants of health behavior among adolescents. Toward this end, the PRB plans to conduct two surveys beginning in the 2009-2010 school year: a cross-sectional national probability survey of U.S. 6th-10th graders that is also consistent with the requirements of the international Health Behavior in School-aged Children (HBSC) survey; and a 4-year longitudinal survey of independent national probability samples of U.S. 11-year-old and 15-year-old students. The HBSC survey is conducted among national or regional samples of students at ages 11, 13, and 15 in about 40 countries. The cross-sectional international HBSC survey requires at least 1536 youth in each age group and a total of 5000 students. The goal of the cross-sectional HBSC survey is to obtain data about adolescent health behavior and to make this information available so as to enable the improvement of health services and programs for youth. The goals of the cross-sectional U.S. survey are to provide health behavior information about adolescents nationally (U.S.-specific protocol) and to enable international comparisons by incorporating the mandatory HBSC protocol. The U.S. longitudinal survey requires a probability sample that will permit estimates of population percentages with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points at the 95% confidence level for each age. The goals of the U.S. longitudinal survey include: to identify the trajectory of adolescent health behaviors from pre-adolescence through the post high school year; to examine the predictors of the onset of key adolescent risk behaviors during this period; to identify family, school, and social/environmental factors that promote or sustain positive health behaviors; and to identify transition points in health risk behaviors and changes in family, school, and social/environmental precursors to these transitions. Surveys consistent with the cross-sectional HBSC were conducted in the U.S. in 1997-1998, 2001-2002, and 2005-2006. In international comparisons, previous HBSC surveys showed that U.S. 15-year-old youth are less likely to smoke than students in most other countries surveyed, even though 13-year-old US students experiment with tobacco in comparable proportions to youth in other countries. U.S. youth are more likely to be overweight than students in the other HBSC countries. U.S. eating habits were also shown to be less healthy with a comparatively high proportion of youth consuming high fat foods and soft drinks with sugar. Analyses of the U.S. national data set have addressed bullying, unintentional injury, behaviors related to obesity, and utilization of health care. The 2009-2010 U.S. surveys will address health-related factors according to rigorous protocols to be developed by the HBSC by June of 2009, and should also include additional factors and dimensions that are relevant to the U.S. experience. To be deemed capable, a small business must demonstrate their ability to: 1) develop a school-based, national probability sampling plan that would provide a nationally-representative sample, including appropriate over-sampling of racial minority students; 2) employ contacts at state and local departments of education and school districts to gain access to schools for surveys; 3) identify and recruit in a period of 4 months two national samples of middle and high schools, one involving > 15000 students and > 400 schools (representing a national probability sample from which the total of 5000 11.5, 13.5, and 15.5 year-old students for the HBSC sub-sample will be drawn) with an 80% rate of participation, and a second national sample of > 6000 11- and 15-year-old students meeting the same criteria as the cross-sectional sample; 4) identify, establish, and maintain a national network of data collectors; 5) recruit, train, and manage data collectors working in locations dispersed across the country; 6) conduct a national school-based survey involving >15000 students and >400 schools; 7) conduct a 4-year longitudinal assessment of >6000 11- and 15-year-old students that may include both in-school and at-home assessments; 7) employ SUDAN or similar statistical programs for basic management of weighted cross-sectional samples; 8) manage large data sets with students nested within schools; 9) prepare data summaries and preliminary analyses; and 10) prepare public use data sets. AT THIS TIME THE NICHD IS ONLY REQUESTING CAPABILITY STATEMENTS FROM SMALL BUSINESSES. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541720. Therefore, the small business size standard for this announcement is $6.5 million or less. See http://www.sba.gov/size/ for information on what is a small business and part 121.106 of the SBA's Small Business Size Regulations on how the SBA calculates the number of employees. Small Businesses that meet the applicable size standard and believe that they have the capabilities described above are encouraged to submit a written Capability Statement to attention of Alice Pagan at the address provided by 5:00 PM Local Time on Friday, February 9, 2007. Overnight deliveries should be mailed to the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Contracts Management Branch, 6100 Executive Boulevard, MSC 7510, Bethesda, Maryland 20852. See Numbered Note 25. No collect calls or facsimiles will be accepted. The Capability Statement should be limited to no more than 15 pages, excluding an Appendix for resumes. Resumes may be included in an Appendix which does not count in the 15 total page limit. The Appendix, which may only include resumes is limited to 15 pages.  The Capability Statement should address each of the competencies stated above. If responses indicate a reasonable expectation of obtaining competitive offers from two or more responsible and capable small business concerns the anticipated subsequent Request for Proposals will be set-aside for small businesses only.

<DESC>The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is interested in identifying Small Business organizations with requisite qualifications to assist with the conduct of two large scale nationally-representative school-based surveys on adolescent health behavior.  The Prevention Research Branch (PRB), an intramural research group of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), conducts research on child and adolescent health behavior.  One of the PRB areas of emphasis is assessment of the prevalence and determinants of health behavior among adolescents.  Toward this end, the PRB plans to conduct two surveys beginning in the 2009-2010 school year: a cross-sectional national probability survey of U.S. 6th-10th graders that is also consistent with the requirements of the international Health Behavior in School-aged Children (HBSC) survey; and a 4-year longitudinal survey of independent national probability samples of U.S. 11-year-old and 15-year-old students.

The HBSC survey is conducted among national or regional samples of students at ages 11, 13, and 15 in about 40 countries.  The cross-sectional international HBSC survey requires at least 1536 youth in each age group and a total of 5000 students.  The goal of the cross-sectional HBSC survey is to obtain data about adolescent health behavior and to make this information available so as to enable the improvement of health services and programs for youth. The goals of the cross-sectional U.S. survey are to provide health behavior information about adolescents nationally (U.S.-specific protocol) and to enable international comparisons by incorporating the mandatory HBSC protocol.

The U.S. longitudinal survey requires a probability sample that will permit estimates of population percentages with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points at the 95% confidence level for each age. The goals of the U.S. longitudinal survey include: to identify the trajectory of adolescent health behaviors from pre-adolescence through the post high school year; to examine the predictors of the onset of key adolescent risk behaviors during this period; to identify family, school, and social/environmental factors that promote or sustain positive health behaviors; and to identify transition points in health risk behaviors and changes in family, school, and social/environmental precursors to these transitions.

Surveys consistent with the cross-sectional HBSC were conducted in the U.S. in 1997-1998, 2001-2002, and 2005-2006. In international comparisons, previous HBSC surveys showed that U.S. 15-year-old youth are less likely to smoke than students in most other countries surveyed, even though 13-year-old US students experiment with tobacco in comparable proportions to youth in other countries.  U.S. youth are more likely to be overweight than students in the other HBSC countries.  U.S. eating habits were also shown to be less healthy with a comparatively high proportion of youth consuming high fat foods and soft drinks with sugar.  Analyses of the U.S. national data set have addressed bullying, unintentional injury, behaviors related to obesity, and utilization of health care.  
            
The 2009-2010 U.S. surveys will address health-related factors according to rigorous protocols to be developed by the HBSC by June of 2009, and should also include additional factors and dimensions that are relevant to the U.S. experience.  To be deemed capable, a small business must demonstrate their ability to: 1)  develop a school-based, national probability sampling plan that would provide a nationally-representative sample, including appropriate over-sampling of racial minority students; 2) employ contacts at state and local departments of education and school districts to gain access to schools for surveys;  3)  identify and recruit in a period of 4 months two national samples of middle and high schools, one involving > 15000 students and > 400 schools (representing a national probability sample from which the total of 5000 11.5, 13.5, and 15.5 year-old  students for the HBSC sub-sample will be drawn) with an 80% rate of participation, and a second national sample of > 6000 11- and 15-year-old students meeting the same criteria as the cross-sectional sample;  4) identify, establish, and maintain a national network of data collectors; 5) recruit, train, and manage data collectors working in locations dispersed across the country; 6) conduct a national school-based survey involving >15000 students and >400 schools; 7) conduct a 4-year longitudinal assessment of >6000 11- and 15-year-old students that may include both in-school and at-home assessments; 7) employ SUDAN or similar statistical programs for basic management of weighted cross-sectional samples; 8) manage large data sets with students nested within schools; 9) prepare data summaries and preliminary analyses; and 10) prepare public use data sets. 

AT THIS TIME THE NICHD IS ONLY REQUESTING CAPABILITY STATEMENTS FROM SMALL BUSINESSES.    THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.   The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541710.  Therefore, the small business size standard for this announcement is 500 employees or less.  See http://www.sba.gov/size/ for information on what is a small business and part 121.106 of the SBA's Small Business Size Regulations on how the SBA calculates the number of employees. 

Small Businesses that meet the applicable size standard and believe that they have the capabilities described above are encouraged to submit a written Capability Statement to attention of Elizabeth Osinski at the address provided by 3:00 PM Local Time on Thursday, November 16, 2006. Overnight deliveries should be mailed to the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Contracts Management Branch, 6100 Executive Boulevard, MSC 7510, Bethesda, Maryland 20852. See Numbered Note 25. No collect calls or facsimiles will be accepted.  The Capability Statement should be limited to no more than 15 pages and it should address each of the competencies stated above.  If responses indicate a reasonable expectation of obtaining competitive offers from two or more responsible and capable small business concerns the anticipated subsequent Request for Proposals will be set-aside for small businesses only.

Interested contractors should supply their name, company name and vehicle license number at least 24 hours in advance of the site visit to the POC in order to gain access to the facility.

The following FAR and DFARS clauses and provisions apply to this acquisition.  The full text version may be viewed at http://farsite.hill.af.mil/.

The Service Contract Act of 1965, as amended, applies to this acquisition, per the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses that have been incorporated by reference.  The applicable wage determination information is as follows:  Wage Determination No. 2005-2141, Rev. No. 3 dated 11/03/2006 applies.
DLAD 52.233-9000-Agency Protests
Companies protesting this procurement may file a protest 1) with the contracting officer, 2) with the General Accounting Office, or 3) pursuant to Executive Order No. 12979, with the Agency for a decision by the Activity?s Chief of the Contracting Office. Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979." (Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the contracting officer; this process is not an appellate review of a contracting officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the contracting officer). Absent a clear indication of the intent to file an agency level protest, protests will be presumed to be protests to the contracting officer.
(End of provision)
DLAD 52.233-9001-Disputes; Agreement to Use Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR).

(a) The parties agree to negotiate with each other to try to resolve any disputes that may arise. If unassisted negotiations are unsuccessful, the parties will use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques to try to resolve the dispute. Litigation will only be considered as a last resort when ADR is unsuccessful or has been documented by the party rejecting ADR to be inappropriate for resolving the dispute. 
(b) Before either party determines ADR inappropriate, that party must discuss the use of ADR with the other party. The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.233-1), or, for the Agency, by the contracting officer, and approved at a level above the contracting officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal counsel (see DLA Directive 5145.1). Contractor personnel are also encouraged to include the ADR Specialist in their discussions with the contracting officer before determining ADR to be inappropriate. 
(c) If you wish to opt out of this clause, check here [   ]. Alternate wording may be negotiated with the contracting officer.
(End of provision)
FAR 52.212-2  Evaluation-Commercial Items applies to this acquisition:
(a)  The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror using the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process.  Proposals shall be evaluated for acceptability only and shall not be rated.  Award will be based on the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for the non-price factors.  The following two (2) non-price factors shall be used to evaluate proposals:  Factor 1-Technical capability to transport, repair and make fully functional the Grove RTT-990 truck mounted crane and Factor 2-Past Performance. Factor 1 shall be evaluated on a go/no go basis.  If a proposal has been determined acceptable (go) on Factor 1, then Factor 2 will be evaluated to determine if the offeror?s past performance history is satisfactory.  An offeror who has submitted a technically acceptable proposal and who has been found to have a satisfactory past performance history will then have its proposal evaluated for the lowest price.
FACTOR 1-Technical capability to transport, repair and make fully functional the Grove RTT-990 truck mounted crane.  The minimum criteria for acceptability for this factor shall be the submission of the following information demonstrating the contractor?s ability to perform:
  1.  Evidence that the offeror operates an established business with experience in the repair of cranes.
  2. Evidence that the offeror can provide the necessary personnel, equipment and financial resources needed to repair the crane.

FACTOR 2 Past Performance.
By past performance the Government means the offeror?s record of conforming to the solicitation specifications and to standards of good workmanship; the offeror?s adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror?s reputation for record of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally the offeror?s business-like concern for the interest of the customer.  Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance.  The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely response.  Offerors who have submitted a technically acceptable proposal will be given an opportunity to address any unfavorable reports of past performance.  In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.
In evaluating an offeror?s past performance record, the Government will consider information in the offeror?s proposal and any information which may be obtained from other sources, including (as applicable) past and present customers and their employees; Federal, State or Local Governments and/or commercial sources.  The information provided should reflect similar contracts for same or similar type service.
The offeror shall provide:
  1. Past experience for preferably three contracts that the offeror has performed within the past 5 years or is performing for projects similar in scope and size to the one described in the Description of Services to include the following information:
    (a)  Company/division name
    (b)  Project Title
    (c)  Contract number
    (d)  Brief description of the contractual effort
    (e)  Period of Performance
    (f)  Contract Dollar Value
    (g)  Current points of contact (include name, address, phone and fax numbers)
  2. A list of any significant problems encountered for the contracts reported in response to paragraph (1) above.  General examples are:  employees not reporting to work on time and customer complaints, i.e., damaged property.  Include also a brief description of how these problems were handled and remedied.
 FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items Alternate I.  Offerors must submit a completed copy of FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial items with their proposal or indicate that the registration has been completed at the ORCA website http://www.orca.bpn.gov.  Failure to include this information with the price proposal will render an offeror ineligible for award.

<ARCHDATE>04132007
<CONTACT>John Fitzsimmons, 301-619-1345
<DESC>The U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Roche Diagnostics Corporation.  The procurement will provide the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center (NBFAC) with missi on critical reagents. The NBFAC is requesting Roche Diagnostics Corporation emPCR Kit, sequencing kit, PicoTiterPlate Kit, Library Prep Kit, and a large Bead Deposition Device.  No other vendor distributes these reagents, which are required for whole genom e sequencing using the Roche GS20 Pyrosequencer.   Any company that believes that it can meet these requirements is invited to submit written notification to the Contract Specialist within 15 calendar days from the date of the publication of this notice.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficie nt detail to demonstrate the companys ability to meet the requirement.  Information may be sent by email to the Contract Specialist at: john.fitzsimmons@amedd.army.mil .  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes.  However, responses r eceived from responsible businesses prior to close of business on 12 February 2007 will be evaluated.  If no responses are received, USAMRAA will proceed with the sole source order.  See numbered Note 22. 1. Contracting Activity: The contracting activity responsible for this action is the US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA), Fort Detrick, MD. On behalf of the National Bioforensic analysis Center (NBFAC). 2. Description of Action: This approval is being requested for a new firm-fixed price contract using R&D funds. 3. Description of Supplies/Services: The required supplies are materials/reagents required for whole genome sequencing using the Roche GS20 Pyrosequencer.  NBFAC is requesting 40 emPCR Kits, 50 Sequencing (70x75) Kits, 50 PicoTiterPlate (70x75) Kits, 2 Lib rary Prep Kits, 2 Large (70x75) Bead Deposition Device complete 2 region.  The total cost of the acquisition is $201,383.00   4. Authority Cited: The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10U.S.C 2304 © (1).  The FAR citation is 6.302-1 and the FAR title is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requireme nts.  5. Reason for Authority Cited: The proposed vendor for this action is Roche Diagnostics Corporation. Roche has the unique qualifications for fulfilling the contract requirements because they are the only vendor distributing the supplies/reagents cited abov e.  No other vendor distributes these reagents 6. Efforts to Obtain Competition: Not applicable, NO effort will be made to solicit offers from as many potential sources as is practicable as there is only one source capable of performing the required services, given the need to ensure the consistency an d scientific quality of the assays to be performed.  No effective competition is anticipated. 7. Actions to Increase Competition: To date no actions to increase competition have been initiated.  Roche Diagnostics Corporations GS20 sequencing reagents are used in assays that are specifically designed for a machine distributed by Roche Diagnostic Co rporation. 8. Market Research: Market research was conducted to find additional suppliers of the Roche Diagnostics Corporation GS20 sequencing reagents.  The sequencing reagents are specific to the machine being used and are distributed solely by Roche Diagnostic Cor poration.  To maintain consistency in the results and quality of the assays, only Roche Diagnostics Corporation GS20 sequencing reagents can be used.  Using reagents not supplied by Roche Diagnostics Corporation would violate the warranty of the Instrument . 9. Interested Sources: To date no other sources have written to express an interest.   10. Other Facts a. Procurement history: Reasonable efforts to retrieve the following items from computer records, contract files, competition advocate office files or other sources are ex pected: (1) Contract numbers and dates of the last several awards. Not applicable (2) Competitive status of these actions. Not applicable (3) Authority previously used for less than full and open competition. Not applicable (4) If a justification was prepared to support the procurement made before this one, a summary of the contents of paragraph 7 of the justification for that procurement and an explanation of the results. Not applicable (5) If any prior award was accomplished by full and open competition, a detailed explanation of the changed circumstances. Not applicable (6) An explanation of any unusual patterns which may be revealed by the history, e.g., several consecutive, urgent buys. Not applicable (7) If a justification was prepared to support the procurement made before this one, briefly describe the circumstances justifying the buy and whether there have been any significant changes. Not applicable b. Acquisition data availability: A statement of work suitable for full and open competition can be developed for this procurement.  It is not being completed because in order to maintain the merit and validity of scientific research, there is only one sou rce that can render the service requested. c. Unusual and compelling urgency: Not applicable d. Subcontracting competition: Not applicable This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are b eing requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
