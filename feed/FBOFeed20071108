<CONTACT>Sharon Kent, Contract Specialist, Phone (206) 526-6035, Fax (206) 526-6025, Email sharon.s.kent@noaa.gov
<DESC>This notice serves as an intent to procure technical and scientific support to NOAA, Office of Response & Restoration (ORR) on an as-needed basis.  There are four major tasks required in the proposed contract:  A) Incident Response & Incident Response Preparation, B) Training, C) Research and Development, and D) Analytical and Laboratory Support.  The proposed Contractor shall provide support on both an emergency and non-emergency time frame.  A higher percentage of effort will be for non-time critical support, but the ability of the contractor to respond quickly during an emergency event is critical to ORR?s mission and paramount to the fulfillment of the contractor?s obligations.  The focus of the technical and scientific support is chemistry related issues during hazardous material and petroleum spills, but ORR may support all hazards missions such as disaster responses and port security contingency planning issues that involve chemical risks.  The contractor shall provide augmented support to ORR staff scientist and Scientific Support Coordinators.

Task A ? Perform 24-hr., 7 days a week (24/7) spill response.  Must respond to calls from ORR within one-hour of the initial contact and be able to provide support directly by verbal consultation or have access to the resources required to investigate the request and provide follow-up communications both verbally and in writing.   Provide oral and written reports as required, reflecting information or specific support requested.  A common request will be a concise assessment of the hazards associated with the spilled chemical, the transport and fate of the chemical relative to the specific incident environment, and any unique or scenario-specific concerns.  Such reports are generally defined as Chemical Hazard Assessments rather than risk assessment since they identify threats rather than probability.   Other emergency requests might include recommendations for sampling or a review of proposed sampling and/or analytical protocols, or to recommend or review mitigation techniques.  The general protocol for such support is to provide an initial oral report or discussion that is followed by written documentation (a report) that is electronically submitted a couple of hours later.   The proposed contract will also be required to perform On-Scene Response Support, requiring travel to the site of the incident to provide direct consultation and technical/scientific support to federal response personnel and cleanup personnel on issues related to chemistry.  In addition to direct consultation, field support activities may include field monitoring, sampling, and assessments.  If the situation requires and a request is made, the contractor must be in route to the site of the emergency within 24-hours of request.  Most incidents occur within the coastal regions of the U.S. and its territories, but international travel has occurred in the past.  The contractor shall maintain the ability to respond internationally if requested.  The contractor shall contribute to spill preparedness activities including drills and the production of spill response planning documents such as Area Contingency Plans as requested.  The contractor?s role shall include the assessment of the hazards associated with chemicals that might be released into the environment.

Task B - The proposed contractor shall develop training materials and conduct training and workshops as requested.  Training may be requested as part of planned activities across the U.S. and its territories or at the contractor?s base of operations.  On rare occasions, a workshop or training activity will require travel outside of the U.S.
Task C - The proposed contractor shall provide technical support in the area of chemistry as required to support ORR in its mission critical activities.  This may require the contractor to develop, manage, and perform research projects, as well as contribute to the projects managed by ORR personnel.  The following represents possible assignments: design and conduct experiments and field test to further the scientific knowledge of the chemical hazards in the environment; development of measurement technologies to detect and quantify dispersed oil; evaluate alternative spill response countermeasures such as solidifying agents.  Results from these efforts shall be documented in written reports and publications, and may influence ORR response and restoration strategies.

Task D - The proposed contractor shall provide analytical support for the analysis of environmental samples contaminated with petroleum and/or petroleum products to determine the relevant physical characteristics, short-term fate, and apparent toxicity of the oil based on the relative distribution of PAH.  Analytical support may extend into the identification of other chemical pollutants or unknowns, but will not extend to the analysis of any known highly dangerous samples that would be outside the scope of work for a typical commercial laboratory. The proposed contractor must be able to assess the quality of the data from the chemical analyses provided and interpret the results in terms of its implications to operational decisions.  Emergency response may require time-critical analytical support for a limited number of samples and may require completion of the requested analyses and preliminary reporting within 24 hours of sample receipt.  Non-emergency analytical support that is associated with ORR research activities and natural resource damage assessment surveys will have task-defined schedules.  Environmental samples may include water, sediments, and animal tissues.  Routinely requested laboratory support functions are as follows:  
-Chemical characterization and compositional analysis of reference oils and spilled oil samples by GC/MS.  Compositional analysis would include the quantification of selected alkanes and PAHs common to oil and typically monitored during oil spill events.
-The proposed contractor must understand oil chemistry and posses the ability to interpret analytical data such that a fingerprint determination between an unknown and reference to determine if they are derived from a common source.
-The laboratory support element must include the ability at assess key physical property data such as density and viscosity of reference and spilled oil samples.
-Assess spilled oil?s applicability to the application of chemical dispersants. 

Work Location:  Most incidents occur within the coastal regions of the US and its territories, but international travel has occurred in the past.  The contractor shall have the ability to respond to international incidents if required.

It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price, labor hour or time-and-material task order IDIQ type contract will be awarded. The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 541990 with a size standard of $6.5 M.   All contractors doing business with the Government are now required to be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).  No award can be made unless the vendor is registered in CCR.

Explosives countermeasures, including the detection, mitigation, and response to explosive threats including manpads, home made explosives, improvised explosive devices, suicide bombers and vehicle borne improvised explosive devices.  

Chemical and Biological analyses and countermeasures, including improved characterization and prioritization of threats, development and detection systems for early attack warning that minimize exposure and speed treatment of victims, new forensic methods to support attribution, and novel concepts for decontamination and restoration, agrodefense, and food security.  

Border and Maritime Security technologies and tools that better secure our land and maritime ports of entry.  Concepts and prototypes for pilot testing surveillance and monitoring capabilities that cover vast expanses of remote border and the development and evaluation of security devices and new inspection methods to secure the large volume of cargo entering U.S. ports daily.  

Command, Control, & Interoperability for emergency responders, security and integrity of networked infrastructures, and the development of automated capabilities that "connect-the-dots" for threat detection.  

Human Factors analyses and techniques to improve detection, analysis, and understanding of threats posed by individuals, groups, and radical movements; preparedness, response and recovery of communities impacted by catastrophic events; and overall effectiveness of homeland security technologies through improved usability and application.  

Infrastructure Protection analyses and techniques for identifying and mitigating all hazard vulnerabilities of the 17 critical infrastructure and key assets that keep our society and economy functioning. 

Multiple awards are anticipated to be issued through this BAA.  This announcement will close on 12/31/2008.  White Paper and/or Full Proposals must be submitted no later than 4:30 PM Eastern Standard Time by 12/31/2008.  NOTE:  There is a registration process (see Section IV of the BAA).

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS: It is the policy of the USCG to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. This agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protestor fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the following address: Commandant (CG-851), 1900 Half Street, SW, 11th Floor Washington, DC  20593, and Phone: (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011

The CSD FoS will provide communications for Los Angeles, Seawolf, and Virginia class attack submarines (SSN), Ohio class guided missile submarines (SSGN) and limited capability for Ohio class ballistic missile submarines (SSBN).  The purpose of CSD is to enable two-way communications between a submarine and operational commanders while operating in missions that require the submarine to remain submerged, below periscope depth, to minimize counter- detection and maximize tactical positioning. The scope of this contract includes requirements for the design, development, test, procurement, limited installation, and sustainment of a CSD FoS.  The CSD FoS will consist of the following subsystems: a Tethered Expendable Communication Buoy - Ultra High Frequency (TECB-UHF), a Tethered Expendable Communication Buoy - Iridium (TECB-Iridium) and submarine and air launched variants of an Acoustic to Radio Frequency (A2RF) Buoy. The Government anticipates a single competitive award for a CSD development and production contract.  The contract will consist of a Cost-Plus Incentive Fee/Award Fee (CPIF/AF) development effort (with an estimated period of performance of two years), as well as Firm Fixed Price option line items for CSD production hardware and Cost Plus Fixed Fee option line items for engineering services. Draft RFP documents and information on how to access other pertinent RFP documents will be posted in the near future on the SPAWAR E-Commerce Central website (https://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil) under "Headquarters" then "Future Opportunities" and then "N00039-08-R-0007."  The final solicitation will be issued without further notice on or about December 2007. The estimated proposal submission date is February 2008, and the estimated contract award date is June 2008. These dates are estimates only; the actual dates will be established in the final RFP.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for one prototype lot of 40 custom fabricated and a packaged intergrated circuits using the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) 0.18 micron process. NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from Mosis based at University of California. The schedule for this project requires parts to be delivered in by January 31, 2008 to meet objectives and retain the participation of collaborators. This is due to the need to re-fabricate an earlier design to correct some errors. Furthermore, Mosis is the only known company that it supports universal scalable design rules ranging from 1.5 to .18 microns. All of Johnson Space Center (JSC) designs at this time are done using scalable design rules. Since scalable design rules depend on unique software processing by Mosis, this service is not available from other foundries. Mosis is the only known vendor that can provide fabrication meeting this schedule. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 2:00 p.m. local time on November 23, 2007.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service has an upcoming requirement for the completion of a Nutrient Management Plan, Conservation Plan, and Recordkeeping and Nutrient Management Plan Implementation as part of a comprehensive nutrient management plan (CNMP). A CNMP is a grouping of conservation practices and management activities which, when combined into a system, will help ensure that both production and natural resource conservation goals are achieved for animal feeding operations.  The Nutrient Management Plan involves developing nutrient budgets (for all sources of nutrients used on the farm) based on crop needs, existing soil nutrient levels, and soil nutrient thresholds. The plan will include appropriate documents and field maps that identify the land base necessary to effectively utilize the manure produced.  The Conservation Plan includes the development of conservation and management practices required to minimize the movement of nutrients on the landscape and conserve the nutrient value for crop production.  This includes the planning and design of practices that address tillage and crop rotation systems, erosion and runoff control and conservation buffers.  Record-keeping and Nutrient Management Plan Implementation includes the collection of soil/manure samples, evaluating planned crop nutrient needs, calculating appropriate manure application rates, calibrating equipment and filing appropriate records for documentation.  Place of performance will be in various counties within South Dakota.  NAICS code is 541620.  The Request for Proposal will be available on or about December 7, 2007.   Successful proposals may result in multiple awards.  Resulting contract or contracts will be of an Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity type consisting of a base year and four option years.  Task orders placed against the contract are subject to negotiations according to the terms and conditions contained therein, and under the guidelines provided in FAR Part 15.

<CONTACT>Edwina Wilkins, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-283-2752, Fax 202-283-4429, Email edwina.a.wilkins@irs.gov
<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service is issuing a Request for Information (RFI) for a Binary Print Compare Utility that meets U.S. Government Section 508 compliance standards (Visually Impaired/Blind Accessibility).  This product needs to be fully Section 508 compliant, or data should be provided as to when should be fully Section 508 compliant.  The IRS requires that all interested vendors address how their product meets or will meet each of the technical standards listed under ?Subpart B?Technical Standards 1194.21 or 1194.22 found at this site: http://www.section508.gov/ (http://www.section508.gov/index.cfm?FuseAction=Content&ID=12#Software).

Technical Requirements:

The Internal Revenue Service produces taxpayer notices in IBM Advanced Function Printing (AFP) format using several document composition tools, including Document Sciences Compuset, and IBM Elixir DesignPro Tools.  Taxpayer notices are currently produced on an IBM zSeries mainframe, running IBM z/OS operating system.

We have begun a multi-year effort to migrate taxpayer notice production to a new hardware platform: Sun UltraSPARC running Sun Solaris operating system.  Taxpayer notices will be produced on the Sun using the Document Sciences product xPression.

As we migrate the production of taxpayer notices from the IBM zSeries mainframe using legacy document composition tools to the new Sun environment utilizing Document Sciences xPression, we require a binary compare utility which will allow us to compare print files electronically.  The utility should report the differences between the files in an easily understandable format, or report that files have no differences when no differences exist.  The utility needs to provide the capability to ?mask? differences, be able to compare a ?Reference file? ? and ?Test file? ? of differing sizes, compare reference file and test file with differing encoding and /or byte ordering, compare AFP files with differing internal structures, compare non-printable fields such as Tag Logical Elements (TLEs).  The utility is not required to run on a Sun UltraSPARC running the Sun Solaris operating system; however it is deemed beneficial due to the long range vision of notice migration.

Below is a detailed explanation of each requirement:

1.	Compare AFP files generated with the same or different composition tools on the 
same or different hosts (z/OS and Solaris).  The table below summarizes possible combinations.
Reference File created on Host / using Composition tool:	Test File created on: Host /using Composition tool
z/OS / Legacy composition tools	z/OS / Legacy composition tools
Solaris/ xPression	Solaris/xPression
z/OS / mainframe composition tools	Solaris / xPression 
Solaris / xPression	z/OS /mainframe composition tools

2.  	Provide masking capabilities at the individual field, page, and document level to
allow comparison of files with the ability for the user to exclude reporting on known differences.  For example, reference and test files being compared could be composed using different fonts (arial versus helvetica), different font types (outline versus raster), different font sizes (12 point versus 8 point), or the reference file could contain a graphic image on the first page of each notice, while the test file does not contain the graphic image.  We require the ability to exclude known differences from the reporting.

3.  	Provide a method of synchronizing files, so that if the reference file and the test file contain differing numbers of records, the can be compared with an indication of which records occurred only on one file.

4.	Compare files with differing internal structures (MO:DCA print streams) This could be due to different structured fields or different MO:DCA triplets within a structured field.  For example, the reference file contains a page segment referred to in an ?Include Page Segment? (IPS) structured field.  In addition, for the reference file, the page segment is also mapped with a ?Map Page Segment? (MPS) structured field in the active environment group for that page.  The test file contains the same page segment referred to in an ?Include Page Segment? (IPS) structured field, but in the test file, the page segment is not mapped with a ?Map Page Segment? (MPS) structured field.  The printed output looks identical.  We need to know that the rendered output is identical.  (see requirement six below for non-printable fields).  Please see the IBM document number SG31-6802-07 Data Streams and Object Architecture Mixed Object Document Content Architecture Reference  for information on MO:DCA.

5.	Compare print files with different encoding schemes (ASCII, EBCDIC, UNICODE UTF-8 and UTF-16, big-endian and little-endian byte ordering) performing the appropriate translations so that files produced on different platforms can be accurately compared.  For example a reference file is created on z/OS with EBCDIC encoding with big-endian byte ordering, and the test file is created on a Sun Solaris 64-bit system with UTF-16E.  

6.	Tag Logical Elements (TLEs) if present in the print files being compared, must also be compared, and differences reported.

Statement of Need:

The purpose of this RFI is to determine if any vendors have a Binary Print Compare Utility that is Section 508 compliant and capable of fulfilling the technical requirements listed above.

Requested Response:

Your response must be limited to 5 pages.
As part of the response for each product, the responder should provide the following information for the Government?s consideration and review:

	We require each vendor to explain:
-If your product meets or exceeds each element in the technical standards listed in ?Subpart B - - Technical Standards 1194.21? Please include section number(s)   
  and  paragraph letters being addressed, and respond to section(s) appropriate to   
  the product.  This is expected to be section 1194.21 ?Software applications and 
  operating systems? paragraphs a through i, or section 1194.22 ?Web-based 
  intranet and internet information and applications? paragraphs a through p.  
  (Note that Section 508 compliance is for developers, business customers, and 
  field end-users use of the product)
  - Does the product meet each of the 6 technical requirements listed above and 
  - Does the product correctly interact with adaptive screen

 Reading software JAWS by Freedom Scientific (hhtp://www/freedomscientific.com/). 
 	
All responsible sources who can provide the specified product as stated above shall submit a written response that includes enough technical detail to allow the IRS to conduct a technical evaluation.  The response should include POC (name and telephone number); GSA contact number if applicable; Delivery date; Business size and Payment terms.  Telephonic inquires will not be accepted.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334519   The US EPA/ Radiation and Indoor Environments National Laboratory under the authority of the FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Canberra Industries, Inc. for (10) Digital Spectrum Analyzers, (3) Genie-2000 Multi-Input Software Rights to Copy, (3) APEX Gamma Software Licenses, (8) Installation and Familiarization for the above, (2) LB 5500 Series 5 Low Background Alpha Beta Detectors, (2) Carrier Plates coded 1-50, 2 Carrier Inserts 5" by 1/8 " (Set of 50), (2) Single Stage Gas Regulators, (2) Eclipse  LB Package w/ Crystal Reports, Broad Energy Germanium Detector, Flanged Big Mac, Remote Detector Chamber (4" neck), Mac Fill Device, (2) Inspector 2000 DSP Portable MCAs, GENIE-2000 Multi-Input Rights To Copy for the above system, Detector / Shield Transport Cart, Laptop PC, an ISOCS/LABSOCS  Characterization for CI Detector, Systems Integration and Test, and (2) Installation and Familiarization for the above.  The justification for a sole source purchase is as follows.  The EPA's Center for Radioanalysis and Quality Assurance (CRQA) is an operational unit of the Radiation and Indoor  Environments (R&IE) National Laboratory, Las Vegas, Nevada whose overall technical mission is laboratory-focused radiation analysis, technical support, and quality system assistance.  As part of the mission, the CRQA provides expertise in radiological emergency preparedness and response and  provides quality technical support in the areas of sample preparation, hotline, decontamination, and analysis.  The CRQA is also responsible for the development of analytical methods in support of radiochemistry and radioanalysis.   The Center currently uses equipment to perform radiological gamma  spectroscopy that is operated using a VMS (Vax) system platform.  The VMS software suite is obsolete and is no longer available for commercial purchase.  The hardware system employs a communication system that requires an older model VMS computer system for operation and functionality. The  application software for the current software platform, provided by Canberra Industries, Inc. is no longer being enhanced or developed.  Based upon these developments, the software and hardware must be upgraded to take advantage of the latest / future developments on Windows Based Platforms.  This  includes Client / Server operation, Web-Based Instruments, redundancy, and other enhanced electronics.    A system upgrade must be made to ensure that CRQA and R&IE stay operational to respond to emergency response situations as well as be compatible with client's and industry-wide standards for  software and hardware.  The Center must upgrade the proprietary software and hardware to conform to contemporary PC-based standards.  Recently, approximately two-thirds of the current system was overhauled with newer proprietary Canberra hardware and software; to complete the software upgrades with  non-proprietary software would result in increased costs to the government and a complete shutdown of the operational units for the gamma and alpha spectroscopy analyses.   In addition to converting the existing software to PC-based standards, the existing hardware must also be upgraded.  The  laboratory currently employs alpha/beta analyzers that are beyond their life expectancy.  CRQA has a model LB-5100 that the manufacturer has deemed 'unserviceable' and will not guarantee its operational status if it is under repair.  CRQA also has another model LB-5100 that is 15 years old.  The  replacements must be able to link up with current Canberra systems already in use.  Inserting a new system into an already existing system would require retraining staff, rewriting all standard operating procedures, rewriting software links, etc., which would prohibitively increase costs.   Furthermore, the 'in situ' or mobile gamma radiation analyzer uses older technology via analog and must be replaced with a digital system.  CRQA currently has one analog system and requires a digital converter to upgrade that system and will also purchase another entire system, which uses  proprietary Canberra software, for redundancy purposes.  The new mobile gamma detection system will act as a back-up system for an 'in situ' system already in use and must provide uninterrupted service and, thus, the new equipment must be able to link up with the current Canberra systems. NO  SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE IS AVAILABLE.  Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting this requirement may submit a response, which if received within two days of the closing date of this announcement, will be considered.  Responses to this announcement must be in  writing to the contracting officer at daniels.ryan@epa.gov.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Program Support Center, Division of Acquisition Management on behalf of the Office of the National Coordinator intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, a cost reimbursement contract for a period of two years with Research Triangle Institute (RTI) under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  RTI is located at 3040 Cornwallis Road, P.O. Box 12194, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709-2194.  The anticipated award date is January 1, 2008.   The sole source award is a follow-on contract to RTI to continue their work with the HISPC in the form of funding, managing and coordinating the multi-state collaborative of old and new HISPC members.  Moreover, the privacy and security solutions developed by the multi-state collaboratives during this follow-on work will be necessary to enable and prepare the health care providers, other health care entities, and government initiatives of each state and territory in the HISPC to participate and integrate with the continued development of a major system, the nationwide health information network (NHIN), which currently has trial implementations underway.  During the contract period of performance RTI will at a minimum, be responsible for ensuring that the states and territories: (1) implement their collaboration strategies; (2) meet the goals established by their collaboration strategies; (3) ensure cross communication between interdependent collaborative groups; (4) report on the collaborative work accomplished and its impacts; and (5) coordinate administrative and logistical activities needed by the multi-state collaboratives including bi-weekly conference calls and in-person meetings.  

In late 2005 HHS awarded Research Triangle Institute International (RTI) a contract to collaborate with the states, territories, and other state-level stakeholders to: (1) assess variations in organization-level business policies and state laws that affect health information exchange; (2) identify and propose practical solutions, while preserving the privacy and security requirements in applicable Federal and state laws and (3) develop detailed plans to implement solutions.   Subsequently, through an open competition, RTI solicited governor-endorsed entities within states and territories to submit proposals to be part of the RTI-led Health Information Privacy and Security Collaboration (HISPC) to complete this work.     A total of thirty-four state and territory based entities were selected and funded by RTI as subcontractors to be part of the HISPC.     At the conclusion of the HISPC?s first phase of work, states and territories developed implementation plans to address privacy and security variations in organization-level business policies and state laws that affect health information exchange in their jurisdiction. 

Since July 2007, HISPC states and territories have been (1) working on a foundational piece of their implementation plan and (2) developing collaboration strategies for multi-state privacy and security solutions to foster or facilitate nationwide electronic health information exchange.     Moreover, RTI has coordinated the recruitment of additional states and territories to be part of the HISPC and at last count nine states and one territory (with several more showing interest) have taken part in the initial collaborative strategy development meetings.     It is clear that both old and new members of the HISPC are passionate and excited about the opportunity to work collaboratively and develop solutions to help advance the national health IT agenda.     Continuing this work without delay and preserving the momentum recently achieved through the addition of new states and territories to the HISPC is of great importance.  The Government is acutely concerned that any break in performance due to finding a new contractor to manage the HISPC would cause a decline in participation and put the states and territories that make up the HISPC (whose collaborative work is the main purpose of the project) at a significant disadvantage. Such a result would unravel critical connections formed over the past year and a half and pose significant challenges to those states and territories developing coordinated privacy and security solutions for nationwide electronic health information exchange.  The Government has heard from a large number of current HISPC members that they would prefer to continue (and expect) to work with RTI in this next phase and that they share the same concerns as the Government noted above.

As result, in addition to the requirements outlined below, which must be included in a capability statement, an interested party must provide letters of intent from all of the following current HISPC states and territories: Alaska; Arizona; Arkansas; California; Colorado; Connecticut; Florida; Illinois; Indiana; Iowa; Kansas; Kentucky; Louisiana; Maine; Massachusetts; Michigan; Minnesota; Mississippi; New Hampshire; New Jersey; New Mexico; New York; North Carolina; Ohio; Oklahoma; Oregon; Puerto Rico; Rhode Island; Utah; Vermont; Washington; West Virginia; Wisconsin; Wyoming.  More information on the current HISPC states and territories can be found at [http://healthit.ahrq.gov/privacyandsecurity].

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may submit capability statements with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Government's requirement that shall include letters of intent from all of the current HISPC states and territories and shall describe your: (1) ability to rapidly, within 4 weeks, establish sub-contractual relationships with all current and new HISPC states and territories; (2) ability to demonstrate a performance model that allows for the maximum amount of Federal dollars to be provided to participating states and territories; (3) capacity to maintain a high degree of cross state/territory collaboration; (4) knowledge of the project, its goals, and overall state and territory privacy and security issues related to electronic health information exchange; (5) experience in subcontracting with multiple states and territories; and (6) ability to quickly assemble an executive team or panel of privacy and security experts to advise and mentor multi-state collaboratives;     No solicitation document is available.     Detailed capability statements shall be submitted within 21 days from the date of publication of this synopsis to the contact point and received by 3:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>CDC, National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory (NPPTL) has a requirement for No Fit Test Respirator Workshop and Research Roadmap. 

Purpose of Contract

The purpose of this contract is to provide a final technical report describing the current state of technology available to enhance the fitting characteristics of negative pressure half-mask air purifying respirator technologies and future interdisciplinary research needs and challenges in developing and certifying air purifying respirators with improved fitting characteristics, leading towards the development of a so-called ?no fit test? respirator.  NIOSH has regulatory authority to certify respirators according to standards promulgated in 42 CFR Part 84 and conducts an active research program to improve respiratory protection devices and the manner in which they are used in the United States.  The final report will be used as an input to prioritize the NIOSH research agenda, guide future changes to respirator certification testing procedures and policies, and by other government agencies and respirator manufacturers to conduct research to address the identified priority research gaps.  

Background and Need

The OSHA respiratory protection standard 1910.134 regulates the use of respirators in the workplace and requires employers to provide their employees with respirators that have been certified by NIOSH according to the standards promulgated in 42 CFR Part 84.  
Millions of workers rely on NIOSH certified respirators to protect them from respiratory hazards such as toxic vapors/gases, particulate matter, and infectious aerosols.  Among the available classes of respirators, disposable filtering facepiece respirators (FFR) and negative pressure half-mask air purifying respirators are often selected.  To achieve expected levels of protection, the respirator must be fit tested on the user to ensure that the selected respirator conforms to their face to provide a tight sealing surface with minimal leakage.  Implementation of a complete respiratory protection program, including fit testing, requires significant technical expertise and resources.  Several independent reports [1-3] by the National Academy of Science?s Institute of Medicine have recommended that the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) sponsor or conduct long-term research activities to develop respirators with improved fitting characteristics or that do not require fit testing at all (i.e., a so-called ?no-fit-test-respirator?).  Better fitting respirators will result in improved worker protection and for employers reduce the burden of maintaining a complete respirator program.

In addition to its mandate to perform respirator certification and testing, NIOSH has an active respiratory protection research program and has sponsored/conducted research on issues related to improving the fitting characteristics of certified respiratory protection devices.  Research conducted by NIOSH is used to provide the scientific basis for respirator performance requirements and recommendations on the selection, care, and use of NIOSH approved devices.  

To form the NIOSH research agenda on respiratory protection, input from a variety of sources is necessary.  Clearly the issue of respirator fit is timely and critical for improving worker safety and health.  A workshop will serve as a means of obtaining information from technology developers, policy-experts, and practitioners related to current and future respirator fit enhancement technologies.  Input will be sought from organizations interested in or currently developing leading edge respirator fit enhancement technology to learn more about the research needs and to identify barriers to commercialization.  Data from the workshop, along with a literature analysis, will be combined into a final report. The final report will be used as an input to prioritize the NIOSH research agenda and guide future changes to respirator certification testing procedures and policies.  It will also be used by other government agencies and respirator manufacturers to conduct research to address the identified priority research gaps.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This Combined Synopsis/Solicitation is amended to include the following questions and answers: 1. In section VI. Government Furnished Equipment it says an overhead projector will be provided. Does that mean a transparency style projector or a computer style projector? ANSWER:  Either type of projector is available.  We assume most  providers would want to use a projector connected to a computer.  2. The RFQ also requests that the proposal be 10 pages or less. Does that 10 pages include things like the cover page and/or attached letters of recommendation and resumes?  ANSWER: The length of the proposal is flexible.  Clarity and succinctness of the proposal is most important 3. When we submit the 3 copies of course materials (workbooks and slides) with the proposal do you also need 3 copies of PMBOK and other textbooks we use, or would one of each be sufficient? ANSWER: We do not need copies of the PMBOK.  We want to review the vendor's course materials.  If commercially available textbooks other than the PMBOK is used for the course one copy would be sufficient. 4. In pricing we generally do a flat rate pricing where travel and materials are included. Is it necessary we break that a part or can we quote it as a flat rate price that covers all three categories? ANSWER: Flat price quote is acceptable.

4.  ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST:  

The restrictions described herein shall apply to the Contractor and its affiliates, consultants and subcontracts under this contract.

An organizational conflict of interest will exist, if a firm has performed as an Environmental Response Action prime contractor and performs as a Comprehensive Long-Term Environmental Action Navy (CLEAN) prime or subcontractor within the same region.  An organizational conflict of interest may also exist on a project basis for firms who have performed as prime contractors on other Navy environmental engineering contracts. 

Offeror is advised that the following Organizational Conflict of Interest clause will be included in the contract.

5252.209 9300 Alt I Organizational Conflicts of Interest.  

ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST (JUN 1994) 

	The restrictions described herein shall apply to the Contractor and its affiliates, consultants and subcontracts under this contract.  If the Contractor under this contract prepares or assists in preparing a statement of work, specifications and plans, the Contractor and its affiliates shall be ineligible to bid or participate, in any capacity, in any contractual effort which is based on such statement of work or specifications and plans as a prime contractor, subcontractor, consultant or in any similar capacity.  The Contractor shall not incorporate its products or services in such statement of work or specification unless so directed in writing by the Contracting Officer, in which case the restriction shall not apply.  This contract shall include this clause in its subcontractor's or consultants' agreements concerning the performance of this contract.   
(End of clause)

ALTERNATE I (JUN 1994). As prescribed in 9.507-2(a)(2), add the following paragraphs to the basic clause:

(b)	Some remedial action may be performed by the architect-engineer firm in order to prevent continued contamination that immediately endangers population or property.

(c)	The Contractor shall provide a statement with his bid or proposal which concisely describes all relevant facts concerning any past, present, or currently planned interest (financial, contractual, organizational, or otherwise) relating to the work to be performed hereunder.  The Contractor warrants that, to the best of the Contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which could give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, or that the Contractor has disclosed all such relevant information prior to award.  If a potential conflict is discovered after award, the Contractor shall make a full disclosure in writing to the Contracting Officer.  The disclosure shall include a description of action which the Contractor proposes to take, after consultation with the Contracting Officer, to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the conflict of interest.

(d)	In addition, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer, in writing, of its intention to compete for, or accept the award of any contract for similar or related work for any Department of Defense, other Agency of the federal government, or state regulatory agency which may involve Navy sites.  Such notification shall be made before the Contractor either competes for or accepts any such contract.

(e)	Remedies:  The Government may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary to avoid an organizational conflict of interest.  If the Contractor was aware of a potential organization conflict of interest prior to award or discovered an actual or potential conflict after award and did not disclose or misrepresented relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, or debar the Contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.

(f)	The Contractor further agrees to insert in any subcontract or consultant agreement hereunder, provisions which shall conform substantially to the language of this clause, including this paragraph (f).  (End of clause)



QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Q1. May the Organizational Chart (Section D) be presented as an 11x17 and counted as 2 pages?

A1.  Yes, the Organization Chart (Section D) may be presented as an 11X17 and may be counted as one page.

Q2.	May unused/empty fields be deleted from the standard forms as long as all required information is shown (for example, extra cells in block 25)?

A2.	Yes.

Q3.	Is the submittal address and point of contact correct (NAVFAC SW)?
	
A3.	Yes, submittals should be sent to NAVFAC SW.

Q4.	May some information on tables, charts, and graphs be presented in a smaller font size than the 12 point font specified in the solicitation?

Q4.	No, please use 12 point font.

Q5.	Would you please confirm the states encompassed in the principal geographical regions? Criteria 1 and 2, as well as the introductory description of the solicitation each indicate a different number of states or territories.

A5.  The states listed in the principal geographic region of the Description and Criteria 1 and 2 are correct as stated.  Specialized experience and professional registration is not requested for all of the states.

Q6.   May a project description in Section F be focused on work performed at a specific facility where work may have been performed under multiple CTOs?

A6.  For submittal purposes, a project may be a single contract task order, a stand-alone contract, or an ID/IQ-type contract.

Q7.	May a program level project description be used in Section F which represents managing multiple CTOs at multiple sites within the specific geography?

A7. For submittal purposes, a project may be a single contract task order, a stand-alone contract, or an ID/IQ-type contract.

Q8.  Due to the limitation of resumes to 1-page, may a 10-point font be used for Section E?

A8.  No, a 12-point font should be used for Part 1 of the SF-330.

Q9.  The pre-solicitation notice indicates that Criteria 2 will be evaluated in Sections E and F.  Since Section F is projects and Criteria 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 will each be assessed in Section H, is the "F" a typo that should read "H"?

A9.  No, Criteria 2 will be evaluated in Sections E and F.  However, additional information in support of the evaluation criteria may be included in Section H.

Q10.  The Presolicitation Notice states that "For submittal purposes, a project on an IDIQ contract is considered a single task order".  Does this mean that the 10 projects required in Section F should be individual task orders and that an overall IDIQ contract may not be written up as a project?

A10.  This requirement has been revised.  For submittal purposes, a project may be a single contract task order, a stand-alone contract, or an ID/IQ-type contract.

Q11.  Under Criteria 3 - Past Performance, Subsection b.3 Citations (Federal, State and Municipal OHSA-Type): We are asked to submit "copies of  Federal, State, and Municipal OSHA type citations for the last five years" as well as "mitigation plans".  As these materials are not standard SF330 materials and the mitigation plans could be quite lengthy, are they included in the 70-page limitation?  

A11.  No, mitigation plans would not be included in the 70-page limitation. 

Q12.  If the citations noted above are not part of the 70-page limit is it acceptable to submit them as a hard copy Attachment?

A12.  Yes.
 
Q13.  Font Size:  In the Submission Requirements section, there is a requirement that "The SF-330 should be typed, one sided, at least 12 pitch font or larger."  Since "pitch" (characters per inch) is not really applicable with current word processing software that measures font size by POINTS, we request that guidance on font be described by point size, and further suggest that the minimum font size be 10 point Times New Roman to accommodate the restricted page count and table formats in the SF-300 form.

A13.  SF-330 Part I should be typed in at least 12-pitch or 12-point font or larger

Q14.  Font Size for Graphics:  We request that the font size specified for the SF-330 text be waived for graphics, figures, tables and captions, and that offerors be required to ensure that font size on graphics, figures, tables and captions be legible.

 A14.  Please use 12 point font for all graphics, figures, tables, etc.

Q15.  Submittal Delivery Address:  In the Submission Requirements section, offerors are instructed to send their SF-330 documents to NAVFAC Southwest in San Diego.  Please verify that this is the correct delivery address and that the NAVFAC Southwest POCs named are the correct POCs for all three submittals, since Ms. Sharon Lee is subsequently listed as our primary Point of Contact for these procurements.

A15.  The submittal delivery address and POCs for all three sumbittals is correct.  Submittal questions should be address to Sharon Lee.

Q16. The fields in the SF330 (particularly Sections A-C, E, F) use 8 pitch for bidders?responses. May we use 8 pitch for responses in these sections and a 12 pitch font in Section H, which is not a form?
A16.  No, 12-pitch must be used for Part I of the SF-330.
Q17.	The submission requirements indicate that the minimum font size allowed is 12 pitch. Is it acceptable within Section H to use a font size of 9 point on tables and graphics  
A17.  No, please use a font size of 12 point for SF330 Part I.
Q18. The Presolicitation Notice below Criterion 7 (Small Business Goals)  states that "For submittal purposes, a project on an IDIQ contract is considered a single task order."  Please confirm that this means that we may use a combination of programs and contract task orders in Section F. We understand that in using programs the Navy will be best able to evaluate:
	a) 	specialized experience in performing multiple, simultaneous projects
	b) 	the full specialized experience list of services
	c) 	specialized experience throughout the geographic footprint
	Please confirm that the approach of providing in Section F a combination programs and contract task orders is acceptable.
A18.  Please see above.  Projects listed in Section F may be stand-alone projects, ID/IQ-type contracts, or both up to the maximum number stated in the synopsis.

Q19.	Criterion 2 Professional Qualifications shows it being evaluated in Section E and F. Would it also be advantageous and relevant to the Navy to include Section G and H in the evaluation of this criterion? 

A19.  Professional Qualifications shall be evaluated in Sections E and F.  However, additional information in support of the evaluation criteria may be included in Section H.
Q20.	In the paragraph above ?Point of Contact,? the contact person is listed as Gracie Steinway or Bea Appling. However, under ?Point of Contact,? it lists Sharon Lee. Are we to assume that Sharon Lee is the first point of contact for our questions?
A20.  That is correct.
Q21.	Although the place of performance is listed as NAVFAC Atlantic, the proposal is to be delivered to San Diego. Please confirm that this is correct.
A21.  That is correct.
	Q22.  Under Criteria 3 Past Performance and Safety, NAVFAC has requested that proposers include copies of OSHA Forms 300, 300A, and 301.  Our legal counsel has advised us that these forms contain information such as employee names and medical information that is considered to be confidential.  If NAVFAC decides to continue to require the submittal of these forms, is it permissible for proposers to remove employee names from the submitted forms?
	Considering that the full set of OSHA Forms 300, 300A and 301 forms could be approximately 500 pages, would NAVFAC prefer these in our Part 1 or bound in a separate document?
A22.  Please see above.  The Safety factor has been revised.
Q23. The Navy has defined a "project" as a single contract task order under an IDIQ. This strict definition means that many of our best single-site examples of our experience cannot be used because our Navy and other DoD clients often use multiple funding sources to complete single-site tasks. We request you redefine a "project"  to include work undertaken at a single site toward an overall objective.

A23.  Projects listed in Section F may be stand-alone projects, ID/IQ-type contracts, or both up to the maximum number stated in the synopsis.

Q24. Criterion 2 (all 3 solicitations) implies that Professional Qualifications be addressed in only Sections E and F (resumes and projects). We request the addition of Section H for demonstrating our Professional Qualifications.

A24. Professional Qualifications shall be evaluated in Sections E and F.  However, additional information in support of the evaluation criteria may be included in Section H.

Q25. Does the Navy wish to define the "Key Personnel" positions it wishes to see as it does for non-A&E solicitations? 

A25.  Please submit resumes for key personnel you intend to use on the contract.

Q26. The Navy's submission requirements state the SF-330 Part I must use 8.5 x 11 inch pages. We request the ability to use 11x17 inch pages where necessary to accommodate graphics and such items as (e.g.) the larger tables required to display the 22 projects criteria of the R-1001 solicitation.

A26.  Organizational charts and tables requested in Section D and G may be on 11 X 17 inch paper.

Q27. Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) was not addressed in the solicitation. We request the Navy reconfirm its previous position for OCI ,  especially as regards award of CLEAN contracts to companies holding RAC and similar contracts as prime contractor in the same AOR.

A27.  Information concerning Organization Conflict of Interest has been included in this Amendment.

Q28. The solicitation lists among the geographies Southeast Asia. As Southeast Asia is typically under PACDIV, was this supposed to be Southwest Asia?

A28.   Please see above.  The geographic region listed in the synopsis for N62470-08-R-1000 has been revised.
 
Q29.  Gracie Steinway, Bea Appling and Sharon Lee are all listed as Points of Contact; to whom should we be sending questions or correspondence on this presolicitation for the Southwest Region?  

A29.  Questions and correspondence on the presoliciations for theSouthwest Region should be addressed to Sharon Lee.

Q30.  Is it correct that interviews for this presolicitation for the Southwest Region will be conducted in Norfolk, VA?

A30.  That is the intent at the current time.

Q31.  Under Criteria 4- Program Management, part c., coordination with other contractors in NAVFAC Atlantic.  Should this be NAVFAC SW?

A31. NAVFAC Southwest is a component command of NAVFAC Atlantic

Q32.  Under Criteria 6- Capacity, the Presolicitation Notice refers to NAVFAC Atlantic contracts.  Should this be NAVFAC SW?

A32.  NAVFAC Southwest is a component command of NAVFAC Atlantic.

Q33.  Does the 12 point font size restriction also apply to SF330 Part II?s?  Is a smaller font size (e.g. 10 point font) acceptable?

A33.  A 10-point font is acceptable for Part II only.

Q34.  The Submission Requirements indicate that the minimum font size allowed is 12 pitch.  May a smaller font size be used in tables and graphics?  

A34.  No, a 12 point font is requested for tables and graphics as well.

Q35.  The SF330 forms provided by the government are in a font size smaller than 12 pitch.  Is it correct to assume that the original font size for the existing text on the forms may remain smaller than 12 pitch?

A35.  Yes, the original font size for the existing text on the form may remain unchanged.

Q36.  The Submission Requirements specify 70 single-sided 8.5 x 11 inch pages.  May an 11 x 17 foldout be included if it is counted as 2 pages?  

A36.  The Organizational Chart (Section D) and the Matrix (Section G) may be on 11 X 17 inch paper and be counted as one page.

Q37.  Is it correct to assume that tabs and dividers are not included in the 70 page count? 

A37.  That is correct.

Q38.  Could you tell me if these opportunities are new requirements or follow-on efforts? If they are re-competitions, could you please provide the incumbent names and contract numbers?

A38.  The new CLEAN contracts are follow-on procurements to the following existing CLEAN contracts.  

a.  N62470-02-D-3052 with CH2M Hill. 

b.  N62472-03-D-0057 with Tetra Tech NUS. 

c.  N62467-04-D-0055 with Tetra Tech NUS.

d.  N68711-95-D-7526 with Bechtel Environmental. 

	Q39.  The solicitation, under Submission Requirements, requests offerer?s to provide evidence that the offerer is permitted by law to practice the profession of architecture or engineering, i.e., state registration number.  The majority of states in the southwest footprint do no license firms for the corporate practice of engineering/architecture-they only license individuals.  Will evidence of a licensed individual (engineer or architect) or business license to operate in the states within the footprint be an adequate response to the above mentioned submission requirement.
A39.  In the states where a firm is not required to be registered under state law, the name of the relevant architect or engineer, their state registration number, and business license is acceptable.  Please indicate if that is the case for the state.

3.  ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST:  

The restrictions described herein shall apply to the Contractor and its affiliates, consultants and subcontracts under this contract.  Attention is directed to FAR Subpart 9.5 and the following provisions.  An organizational conflict of interest will exist, if a firm has performed as an Environmental Response Action prime contractor and performs as a Comprehensive Long-Term Environmental Action Navy (CLEAN) prime or subcontractor within the same region.  An organizational conflict of interest may also exist on a project basis for firms who have performed as prime contractors on other Navy environmental engineering contracts. 

Offeror is advised that the following Organizational Conflict of Interest clause will be included in the contract.

5252.209 9300 Alt I Organizational Conflicts of Interest.  

ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST (JUN 1994) 

	The restrictions described herein shall apply to the Contractor and its affiliates, consultants and subcontracts under this contract.  If the Contractor under this contract prepares or assists in preparing a statement of work, specifications and plans, the Contractor and its affiliates shall be ineligible to bid or participate, in any capacity, in any contractual effort which is based on such statement of work or specifications and plans as a prime contractor, subcontractor, consultant or in any similar capacity.  The Contractor shall not incorporate its products or services in such statement of work or specification unless so directed in writing by the Contracting Officer, in which case the restriction shall not apply.  This contract shall include this clause in its subcontractor's or consultants' agreements concerning the performance of this contract.   
(End of clause)

ALTERNATE I (JUN 1994). As prescribed in 9.507-2(a)(2), add the following paragraphs to the basic clause:

(b)	Some remedial action may be performed by the architect-engineer firm in order to prevent continued contamination that immediately endangers population or property.

(c)	The Contractor shall provide a statement with his bid or proposal which concisely describes all relevant facts concerning any past, present, or currently planned interest (financial, contractual, organizational, or otherwise) relating to the work to be performed hereunder.  The Contractor warrants that, to the best of the Contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which could give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, or that the Contractor has disclosed all such relevant information prior to award.  If a potential conflict is discovered after award, the Contractor shall make a full disclosure in writing to the Contracting Officer.  The disclosure shall include a description of action which the Contractor proposes to take, after consultation with the Contracting Officer, to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the conflict of interest.

(d)	In addition, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer, in writing, of its intention to compete for, or accept the award of any contract for similar or related work for any Department of Defense, other Agency of the federal government, or state regulatory agency which may involve Navy sites.  Such notification shall be made before the Contractor either competes for or accepts any such contract.

(e)	Remedies:  The Government may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary to avoid an organizational conflict of interest.  If the Contractor was aware of a potential organization conflict of interest prior to award or discovered an actual or potential conflict after award and did not disclose or misrepresented relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, or debar the Contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.

(f)	The Contractor further agrees to insert in any subcontract or consultant agreement hereunder, provisions which shall conform substantially to the language of this clause, including this paragraph (f).  (End of clause)



QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Q1. May the Organizational Chart (Section D) be presented as an 11x17 and counted as 2 pages?

A1.  Yes, the Organization Chart (Section D) may be presented as an 11X17 but may be counted as one page.

Q2.	May unused/empty fields be deleted from the standard forms as long as all required information is shown (for example, extra cells in block 25)?

A2.	Yes.

Q3.	Is the submittal address and point of contact correct (NAVFAC SW)?
	
A3.	Yes, submittals should be sent to NAVFAC SW.

Q4.	May some information on tables, charts, and graphs be presented in a smaller font size than the 12 point font specified in the solicitation?

Q4.	No, please use 12 point font.

Q5.	Would you please confirm the states encompassed in the principal geographical regions? Criteria 1 and 2, as well as the introductory description of the solicitation each indicate a different number of states or territories.

A5.  The states listed in the principal geographic region of the Description and Criteria 1 and 2 are correct as stated.  Specialized experience and professional registration is not requested for all of the states.

Q6.   May a project description in Section F be focused on work performed at a specific facility where work may have been performed under multiple CTOs?

A6.  For submittal purposes, a project may be a single contract task order, a stand-alone contract, or an ID/IQ-type contract.

Q7.	May a program level project description be used in Section F which represents managing multiple CTOs at multiple sites within the specific geography?

A7. For submittal purposes, a project may be a single contract task order, a stand-alone contract, or an ID/IQ-type contract.

Q8.  Due to the limitation of resumes to 1-page, may a 10-point font be used for Section E?

A8.  No, a 12-point font should be used for Part I of the SF-330.

Q9.  The pre-solicitation notice indicates that Criteria 2 will be evaluated in Sections E and F.  Since Section F is projects and Criteria 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 will each be assessed in Section H, is the "F" a typo that should read "H"?

A9.  No, Criteria 2 will be evaluated in Sections E and F.  However, additional information in support of the evaluation criteria may be included in Section H.

Q10.  The Presolicitation Notice states that "For submittal purposes, a project on an IDIQ contract is considered a single task order".  Does this mean that the 10 projects required in Section F should be individual task orders and that an overall IDIQ contract may not be written up as a project?

A10.  This requirement has been revised.  For submittal purposes, a project may be a single contract task order, a stand-alone contract, or an ID/IQ-type contract.

Q11.  Under Criteria 3 - Past Performance, Subsection b.3 Citations (Federal, State and Municipal OHSA-Type): We are asked to submit "copies of  Federal, State, and Municipal OSHA type citations for the last five years" as well as "mitigation plans".  As these materials are not standard SF330 materials and the mitigation plans could be quite lengthy, are they included in the 70-page limitation?  

A11.  No, mitigation plans would not be included in the 80-page limitation. 

Q12.  If the citations noted above are not part of the 80-page limit is it acceptable to submit them as a hard copy Attachment?

A12.  Yes.
 
Q13.  Font Size:  In the Submission Requirements section, there is a requirement that "The SF-330 should be typed, one sided, at least 12 pitch font or larger."  Since "pitch" (characters per inch) is not really applicable with current word processing software that measures font size by POINTS, we request that guidance on font be described by point size, and further suggest that the minimum font size be 10 point Times New Roman to accommodate the restricted page count and table formats in the SF-300 form.

A13.  SF-330 Part I should be typed in at least 12-pitch or 12-point font or larger

Q14.  Font Size for Graphics:  We request that the font size specified for the SF-330 text be waived for graphics, figures, tables and captions, and that offerors be required to ensure that font size on graphics, figures, tables and captions be legible.

 A14.  Please use 12 point font size for graphics, figures, tables, etc.

Q15.  Submittal Delivery Address:  In the Submission Requirements section, offerors are instructed to send their SF-330 documents to NAVFAC Southwest in San Diego.  Please verify that this is the correct delivery address and that the NAVFAC Southwest POCs named are the correct POCs for all three submittals, since Ms. Sharon Lee is subsequently listed as our primary Point of Contact for these procurements.

A15.  The submittal delivery address and POCs for all three sumbittals is correct.  Submittal questions should be address to Sharon Lee.

Q16. The fields in the SF330 (particularly Sections A-C, E, F) use 8 pitch for bidders?responses. May we use 8 pitch for responses in these sections and a 12 pitch font in Section H, which is not a form?
A16.  No, 12-pitch must be used for Part I of the SF-330.
Q17.	The submission requirements indicate that the minimum font size allowed is 12 pitch. Is it acceptable within Section H to use a font size of 9 point on tables and graphics  
A17.  No, please use a font size of 12 point for Part I of the SF330.
Q18. The Presolicitation Notice below Criterion 7 (Small Business Goals)  states that "For submittal purposes, a project on an IDIQ contract is considered a single task order."  Please confirm that this means that we may use a combination of programs and contract task orders in Section F. We understand that in using programs the Navy will be best able to evaluate:
	a) 	specialized experience in performing multiple, simultaneous projects
	b) 	the full specialized experience list of services
	c) 	specialized experience throughout the geographic footprint
	Please confirm that the approach of providing in Section F a combination programs and contract task orders is acceptable.
A18.  Please see above.  Projects listed in Section F may be stand-alone projects, ID/IQ-type contracts, or both up to the maximum number stated in the synopsis.
Q19.	Criterion 2 Professional Qualifications shows it being evaluated in Section E and F. Would it also be advantageous and relevant to the Navy to include Section G and H in the evaluation of this criterion? 
A19.  Professional Qualifications shall be evaluated in Sections E and F.  However, additional information in support of the evaluation criteria may be included in Section H.
Q20.	In the paragraph above ?Point of Contact,? the contact person is listed as Gracie Steinway or Bea Appling. However, under ?Point of Contact,? it lists Sharon Lee. Are we to assume that Sharon Lee is the first point of contact for our questions?
A20.  That is correct.
Q21.	Although the place of performance is listed as NAVFAC Atlantic, the proposal is to be delivered to San Diego. Please confirm that this is correct.
A21.  That is correct.
Q22.	Under Criteria 3 Past Performance and Safety, NAVFAC has requested that proposers include copies of OSHA Forms 300, 300A, and 301.  Our legal counsel has advised us that these forms contain information such as employee names and medical information that is considered to be confidential.  If NAVFAC decides to continue to require the submittal of these forms, is it permissible for proposers to remove employee names from the submitted forms?
	Considering that the full set of OSHA Forms 300, 300A and 301 forms could be approximately 500 pages, would NAVFAC prefer these in our Part 1 or bound in a separate document?
A22.  Please see above.  The Safety factor has been revised.
Q23. The Navy has defined a "project" as a single contract task order under an IDIQ. This strict definition means that many of our best single-site examples of our experience cannot be used because our Navy and other DoD clients often use multiple funding sources to complete single-site tasks. We request you redefine a "project"  to include work undertaken at a single site toward an overall objective.

A23.  Projects listed in Section F may be stand-alone projects, ID/IQ-type contracts, or both up to the maximum number stated in the synopsis.

Q24. Under solicitation N62470-08-R-1001 (NE, SE, Midwest, NW) you have allowed 22 projects to demonstrate experience over this wide geographical area.  We request that the  page count  be increased to at least 80 pages instead of 70  for this submittal to accommodate the additional projects.

A24.  Please see above.  Page limitation for N62470-08-R-1001 only has been increased to 80 pages to accommodate the additional projects requested.

Q25. Criterion 2 (all 3 solicitations) implies that Professional Qualifications be addressed in only Sections E and F (resumes and projects). We request the addition of Section H for demonstrating our Professional Qualifications.

A27. Organizational charts and tables requested in Section D and G may be on 11 X 17 inch paper.

Q28. Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) was not addressed in the solicitation. We request the Navy reconfirm its previous position for OCI ,  especially as regards award of CLEAN contracts to companies holding RAC and similar contracts as prime contractor in the same AOR.

A28.  Information concerning Organization Conflict of Interest has been included in Amendment.

Q29.  Gracie Steinway, Bea Appling and Sharon Lee are all listed as Points of Contact; to whom should we be sending questions or correspondence on this presolicitation for the Southwest Region?

5252.209 9300 ALT I Organizational Conflicts of Interest.  

ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST (JUN 1994) 

	The restrictions described herein shall apply to the Contractor and its affiliates, consultants and subcontracts under this contract.  If the Contractor under this contract prepares or assists in preparing a statement of work, specifications and plans, the Contractor and its affiliates shall be ineligible to bid or participate, in any capacity, in any contractual effort which is based on such statement of work or specifications and plans as a prime contractor, subcontractor, consultant or in any similar capacity.  The Contractor shall not incorporate its products or services in such statement of work or specification unless so directed in writing by the Contracting Officer, in which case the restriction shall not apply.  This contract shall include this clause in its subcontractor's or consultants' agreements concerning the performance of this contract.   
(End of clause)

ALTERNATE I (JUN 1994). As prescribed in 9.507-2(a)(2), add the following paragraphs to the basic clause:

(b)	Some remedial action may be performed by the architect-engineer firm in order to prevent continued contamination that immediately endangers population or property.

(c)	The Contractor shall provide a statement with his bid or proposal which concisely describes all relevant facts concerning any past, present, or currently planned interest (financial, contractual, organizational, or otherwise) relating to the work to be performed hereunder.  The Contractor warrants that, to the best of the Contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which could give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, or that the Contractor has disclosed all such relevant information prior to award.  If a potential conflict is discovered after award, the Contractor shall make a full disclosure in writing to the Contracting Officer.  The disclosure shall include a description of action which the Contractor proposes to take, after consultation with the Contracting Officer, to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the conflict of interest.

(d)	In addition, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer, in writing, of its intention to compete for, or accept the award of any contract for similar or related work for any Department of Defense, other Agency of the federal government, or state regulatory agency which may involve Navy sites.  Such notification shall be made before the Contractor either competes for or accepts any such contract.

(e)	Remedies:  The Government may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary to avoid an organizational conflict of interest.  If the Contractor was aware of a potential organization conflict of interest prior to award or discovered an actual or potential conflict after award and did not disclose or misrepresented relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, or debar the Contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.

(f)	The Contractor further agrees to insert in any subcontract or consultant agreement hereunder, provisions which shall conform substantially to the language of this clause, including this paragraph (f).  (End of clause)


QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Q1. May the Organizational Chart (Section D) be presented as an 11x17 and counted as 2 pages?

A1.  Yes, the Organization Chart (Section D) may be presented as an 11X17 but may be counted as one page.

Q2.	May unused/empty fields be deleted from the standard forms as long as all required information is shown (for example, extra cells in block 25)?

A2.	Yes.

Q3.	Is the submittal address and point of contact correct (NAVFAC SW)?
	
A3.	Yes, submittals should be sent to NAVFAC SW.

Q4.	May some information on tables, charts, and graphs be presented in a smaller font size than the 12 point font specified in the solicitation?

Q4.	Please use 12 point font.

Q5.	Would you please confirm the states encompassed in the principal geographical regions? Criteria 1 and 2, as well as the introductory description of the solicitation each indicate a different number of states or territories.

A5.  The states listed in the principal geographic region of the Description and Criteria 1 and 2 are correct as stated.  Specialized experience and professional registration is not requested for all of the states.

Q6.   May a project description in Section F be focused on work performed at a specific facility where work may have been performed under multiple CTOs?

A6.  For submittal purposes, a project may be a single contract task order, a stand-alone contract, or an ID/IQ-type contract.

Q7.	May a program level project description be used in Section F which represents managing multiple CTOs at multiple sites within the specific geography?

A7. For submittal purposes, a project may be a single contract task order, a stand-alone contract, or an ID/IQ-type contract.

Q8.  Due to the limitation of resumes to 1-page, may a 10-point font be used for Section E?

A8.  No, a 12-point font should be used for Part I of the SF-330.

Q9.  The pre-solicitation notice indicates that Criteria 2 will be evaluated in Sections E and F.  Since Section F is projects and Criteria 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 will each be assessed in Section H, is the "F" a typo that should read "H"?

A9.  No, Criteria 2 will be evaluated in Sections E and F.  However, additional information in support of the evaluation criteria may be included in Section H.

Q10.  The Presolicitation Notice states that "For submittal purposes, a project on an IDIQ contract is considered a single task order".  Does this mean that the 10 projects required in Section F should be individual task orders and that an overall IDIQ contract may not be written up as a project?

A10.  This requirement has been revised.  For submittal purposes, a project may be a single contract task order, a stand-alone contract, or an ID/IQ-type contract.

Q11.  Under Criteria 3 - Past Performance, Subsection b.3 Citations (Federal, State and Municipal OHSA-Type): We are asked to submit "copies of  Federal, State, and Municipal OSHA type citations for the last five years" as well as "mitigation plans".  As these materials are not standard SF330 materials and the mitigation plans could be quite lengthy, are they included in the 70-page limitation?  

A11.  No, mitigation plans would not be included in the 70-page limitation. 

Q12.  If the citations noted above are not part of the 70-page limit is it acceptable to submit them as a hard copy Attachment?

A12.  Yes.
 
Q13.  Font Size:  In the Submission Requirements section, there is a requirement that "The SF-330 should be typed, one sided, at least 12 pitch font or larger."  Since "pitch" (characters per inch) is not really applicable with current word processing software that measures font size by POINTS, we request that guidance on font be described by point size, and further suggest that the minimum font size be 10 point Times New Roman to accommodate the restricted page count and table formats in the SF-300 form.

A13.  SF-330 Part I should be typed in at least 12-pitch or 12-point font or larger

Q14.  Font Size for Graphics:  We request that the font size specified for the SF-330 text be waived for graphics, figures, tables and captions, and that offerors be required to ensure that font size on graphics, figures, tables and captions be legible.

 A14.  Please use 12 point font for graphics, figures, and tables, etc..

Q15.  Submittal Delivery Address:  In the Submission Requirements section, offerors are instructed to send their SF-330 documents to NAVFAC Southwest in San Diego.  Please verify that this is the correct delivery address and that the NAVFAC Southwest POCs named are the correct POCs for all three submittals, since Ms. Sharon Lee is subsequently listed as our primary Point of Contact for these procurements.

A15.  The submittal delivery address and POCs for all three sumbittals is correct.  Submittal questions should be address to Sharon Lee.

Q16. The fields in the SF330 (particularly Sections A-C, E, F) use 8 pitch for bidders?responses. May we use 8 pitch for responses in these sections and a 12 pitch font in Section H, which is not a form?
A16.  No, 12-pitch must be used for Part I of the SF-330.
Q17.	The submission requirements indicate that the minimum font size allowed is 12 pitch. Is it acceptable within Section H to use a font size of 9 point on tables and graphics  
A17.  No, please use a font size of 12 point for Part I of the SF330.
Q18. The Presolicitation Notice below Criterion 7 (Small Business Goals)  states that "For submittal purposes, a project on an IDIQ contract is considered a single task order."  Please confirm that this means that we may use a combination of programs and contract task orders in Section F. We understand that in using programs the Navy will be best able to evaluate:
	a) 	specialized experience in performing multiple, simultaneous projects
	b) 	the full specialized experience list of services
	c) 	specialized experience throughout the geographic footprint
	Please confirm that the approach of providing in Section F a combination programs and contract task orders is acceptable.
A18.  Please see above.  Projects listed in Section F may be stand-alone projects, ID/IQ-type contracts, or both up to the maximum number stated in the synopsis.
Q19.	Criterion 2 Professional Qualifications shows it being evaluated in Section E and F. Would it also be advantageous and relevant to the Navy to include Section G and H in the evaluation of this criterion? 
A19.  Professional Qualifications shall be evaluated in Sections E and F.  However, additional information in support of the evaluation criteria may be included in Section H.
Q20.	In the paragraph above ?Point of Contact,? the contact person is listed as Gracie Steinway or Bea Appling. However, under ?Point of Contact,? it lists Sharon Lee. Are we to assume that Sharon Lee is the first point of contact for our questions?
A20.  That is correct.
Q21.	Although the place of performance is listed as NAVFAC Atlantic, the proposal is to be delivered to San Diego. Please confirm that this is correct.
A21.  That is correct.
Q22.	Under Criteria 3 Past Performance and Safety, NAVFAC has requested that proposers include copies of OSHA Forms 300, 300A, and 301.  Our legal counsel has advised us that these forms contain information such as employee names and medical information that is considered to be confidential.  If NAVFAC decides to continue to require the submittal of these forms, is it permissible for proposers to remove employee names from the submitted forms?
	Considering that the full set of OSHA Forms 300, 300A and 301 forms could be approximately 500 pages, would NAVFAC prefer these in our Part 1 or bound in a separate document?
A22.  Please see above.  The Safety factor has been revised.
Q23. The Navy has defined a "project" as a single contract task order under an IDIQ. This strict definition means that many of our best single-site examples of our experience cannot be used because our Navy and other DoD clients often use multiple funding sources to complete single-site tasks. We request you redefine a "project"  to include work undertaken at a single site toward an overall objective.

A23.  Projects listed in Section F may be stand-alone projects, ID/IQ-type contracts, or both up to the maximum number stated in the synopsis.

Q24. Criterion 2 (all 3 solicitations) implies that Professional Qualifications be addressed in only Sections E and F (resumes and projects). We request the addition of Section H for demonstrating our Professional Qualifications.

A24. Professional Qualifications shall be evaluated in Sections E and F.  However, additional information in support of the evaluation criteria may be included in Section H.

Q25. Does the Navy wish to define the "Key Personnel" positions it wishes to see as it does for non-A&E solicitations? 

A25.  Please submit resumes for key personnel you intend to use on the contract.

Q26. The Navy's submission requirements state the SF-330 Part I must use 8.5 x 11 inch pages. We request the ability to use 11x17 inch pages where necessary to accommodate graphics and such items as (e.g.) the larger tables required to display the 22 projects criteria of the R-1001 solicitation.

A26.  Organizational charts and tables requested in Section D and G may be on 11 X 17 inch paper.

Q27. Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) was not addressed in the solicitation. We request the Navy reconfirm its previous position for OCI ,  especially as regards award of CLEAN contracts to companies holding RAC and similar contracts as prime contractor in the same AOR.

A27.  Information concerning Organization Conflict of Interest has been included in Amendment.

Q28.  Gracie Steinway, Bea Appling and Sharon Lee are all listed as Points of Contact; to whom should we be sending questions or correspondence on this presolicitation for the Southwest Region?  

A28.  Questions or correspondence on the presoliciations for theSouthwest Region should be addressed to Sharon Lee.

Q29.  Is it correct that interviews for this presolicitation for the Southwest Region will be conducted in Norfolk, VA?

A29.  That is the intent at the current time.
 

Q30.  Under Criteria 4- Program Management, part c., coordination with other contractors in NAVFAC Atlantic.  Should this be NAVFAC SW?

A30. NAVFAC Southwest is a component command of NAVFAC Atlantic

Q31.  Under Criteria 6- Capacity, the Presolicitation Notice refers to NAVFAC Atlantic contracts.  Should this be NAVFAC SW?

A31.  NAVFAC Southwest is a component command of NAVFAC Atlantic.

Q32.  Does the 12 point font size restriction also apply to SF330 Part II?s?  Is a smaller font size (e.g. 10 point font) acceptable?

A32.  A 10-point font is acceptable for Part II only

Q33.  The Submission Requirements indicate that the minimum font size allowed is 12 pitch.  May a smaller font size be used in tables and graphics?  

A33.  No, a 12 point font is requested for tables and graphics as well.

Q34.  The SF330 forms provided by the government are in a font size smaller than 12 pitch.  Is it correct to assume that the original font size for the existing text on the forms may remain smaller than 12 pitch?

A34.  Yes, the original font size for the existing text on the form may remain unchanged.

Q35.  The Submission Requirements specify 70 single-sided 8.5 x 11 inch pages.  May an 11 x 17 foldout be included if it is counted as 2 pages?  

A35.  The Organizational Chart (Section D) and the Matrix (Section G) may be on 11 X 17 inch paper and be counted as one page.

Q36.  Is it correct to assume that tabs and dividers are not included in the 70 page count? 

A36.  That is correct.

Q37.  Could you tell me if these opportunities are new requirements or follow-on efforts? If they are re-competitions, could you please provide the incumbent names and contract numbers?

A37.  The new CLEAN contracts are follow-on procurements to the following existing CLEAN contracts.  

a.  N62470-02-D-3052 with CH2M Hill. T

b.  N62472-03-D-0057 with Tetra Tech NUS. 

c.  N62467-04-D-0055 with Tetra Tech NUS.

d.  N68711-95-D-7526 with Bechtel Environmental.
 
	Q38.  The solicitation, under Submission Requirements, requests offerer?s to provide evidence that the offerer is permitted by law to practice the profession of architecture or engineering, i.e., state registration number.  The majority of states in the southwest footprint do no license firms for the corporate practice of engineering/architecture-they only license individuals.  Will evidence of a licensed individual (engineer or architect) or business license to operate in the states within the footprint be an adequate response to the above mentioned submission requirement.
	A38.  In the states where a firm is not required to be registered under state law, the name of the relevant architect or engineer, their state registration number, and business license acceptable.  Please indicate if that is the case for the state.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Part I:  Background information and Description of Acquisition

Title:  Acquisition of Zeiss Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope for Advanced Technology Center.

Purpose/Brief History:

The investigators at the Advanced Technology Center (ATC) seek to purchase a laser scanning confocal microscope for use as a core instrument within the facility. The investigators represent a diverse group of scientific interests, with different research backgrounds and projects, however all the groups have a demonstrated need for confocal microscopy to support their respective projects.  Projects that will utilize this instrument include: in vitro angiogenesis assays including vessel formation and interaction of proteins that play a role in directing vessel formation, in vitro differentiation assays (associated with angiogenesis), in vivo and in vitro assays of neuroendocrine development and carcinogenesis, in vitro characterization of siRNA and drug mediated toxicity, characterization of antibody-antigen interactions in 3-D assay platforms, and protein: protein interaction in tissue microarrays. 

The specific projects with which the JOFOC is associated are primarily imaging of cells and tissues through the use of fluorescent tagged proteins, antibodies and small molecules, or fluorescent dyes know to selectively interact with specific cellular proteins or organelles. The fluorescent probes can then be visualized using the Zeiss LSM 510 microscope. In addition to direct visualization of these molecules the Zeiss LSM 510 meta is capable of analyzing the interaction of fluorescent tagged molecules via fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis, fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching (FRAP) analysis, as well as spectral acquisition.

The Zeiss 510 Meta laser scanning microscope (LSM) will be and upgrade to existing equipment which is a Zeiss LSM5 Pascal, thus allowing trade-in credit for portions of the old equipment. In addition because of the diversity of projects a flexible, upgradeable inverted laser scanning confocal microscope is desired. The instrument must offer the following features: 

-Inverted microscope frame 
-Transmitted light path/ visible illumination (white light)
-Fluorescent (mercury lamp) light source and path
-Four lasers, at 405, 440-514 range 561 and 633 nm wavelengths 
-Integrated software control of lightpath, laser scanning and image analysis
-Z-motor with 10nm step size
-Objectives, suitable for fluorescent imaging	
-10X, 20X, 40X dry
-63X oil
-Three Confocal detections - 2 R/FL detectors and one polychromatic detector
-User accessible and changeable fluorescent filters
-FRET Imaging Capable
-FRAP Imaging Capable


PART II: Facts and Reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition

1.	Statute

Statute: 13.106-1(b) and 13.501-1(a)

(a) Solicitation from a single source.  

(1)	For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officer may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g. urgency, exclusive licensing agreement, or industrial mobilization).

(2)	For Sole source acquisition of commercial items in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold conducted pursuant to subpart 13.5, the requirements at 13.501(a) apply.
	
No other requirement and/or type for supply or service will satisfy agency need.

<DESC>A. General Information: The Central Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) Region, a military integrated delivery network comprised of 42 Army, Navy, and Air Force medical treatment facilities (MTFs) in the states of Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado,  Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming, announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation for the standardization of Disposable Endo-Mechanical Devices.   The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to achieve a best value determination for Disposable Endo-Mechanical Devices products that represent the clinically preferred product.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained  through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.  The major facilities in the area include but are not limited to Brooke Army Medical Center Fort Sam Houston TX, Wilford Hall Medical Center Lackland AFB, TX, Darnall Army Medical Center, Fort Hood, TX, Reynolds ACH F ort Sill, OK, William Beaumont Army Medical Center Fort Bliss, TX, 10th Medical Group USAF Academy, CO, Evans ACH Fort Carson CO, Fort General Leonard Wood ACH, MO, Fort Riley, KS, 99th Medical Group Nellis AFB, NV, and Bayne-Jones ACH Fort Polk, LA. This initiative is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor Program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, (DSCP) Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company MUST have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) AND a s eparate commercial agreement with the DoD Prime Vendor(s) for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items.  This is a supplement to the Pr ime Vendor program and it is NOT a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime Vendor program please access the web site at: https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil. The TRBO will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage/fore casted requirements.  The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods.  The anticipated award date is February 2008.  The overall evaluation will be based upon technical, clinic al, and pricing factors.  Technical and clinical factors are the most important evaluation factors.  Clinical/Performance evaluation is more important than the price.  Price is a consideration but is less important than technical and clinical factors.  The  final award recommendation will be determined by utilizing the best value/trade-off criteria.  B. Products and Performance Required:  The Central Region is seeking a vendor that can supply Disposable Endo-Mechanical Devices products.  The estimated total volume for this region in this product line is approximately $3 million based on historical sale s for a 12-month period.   C. Instructions to All Offerors:  INTERESTED RESPONDENTS MUST PROVIDE DETAILED HARD COPY RESPONSES TO THE TECHNICAL CRITERIA REQUIREMENTS STATED WITHIN THIS NOTICE BY 3PM CST ON 30 November 2007.  THOSE COMPANIES THAT DO NOT RESPOND BY THIS DATE WILL BE EL IMINATED FROM CONSIDERATION.  Interested offerors should respond with hard copies of the following information: company name, point of contact, address, phone number, fax, email address, solicitation number, DAPA number and complete answers to the technica l criteria.  Responses should be sent via your preferred delivery carrier with a requested return receipt and/or tracking number to Mr. Jim Quinn, Tri-Service Regional Business Office, 7800 IH-10 West, Suite 220, San Antonio TX 78230. (ELECTRONIC SUBMISSIO NS ARE NO LONGER ACCEPTED)  Contact Mr. Jim Quinn at (210) 292-3295 prior to the closing date of this solicitation with any further questions.  If your company is not a current DAPA holder for this product line, contact DSCP, Ms. Kim Nichols at (215) 737-7 124 or email Kim.nichols@dla.mi l to apply for a DAPA.   D. Evaluation Criteria:  The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Central Region. They are the deci sion makers for this initiative and evaluate the recommendations from the Clinical Product Team (CPT).  The CPT is comprised of medical professionals from several disciplines applicable to the product line under review. The CPT will initially rate the tech nical criteria.  A rating of zero on technical criteria number one will disqualify the vendor from further participation in this solicitation.  All other technical criteria will be weighted equally.  Vendors achieving an overall technical score of 23 or hi gher will be invited to participate in the clinical evaluation.  Those receiving a technical rating below 23 will be notified of their elimination from further participation.  Vendors invited to participate in the clinical evaluation will be asked to suppl y samples for evaluation and submit a best price offer.  Vendors are required to supply samples at no cost to the government.  A three-week period will be allotted to vendors to supply evaluation products.  Vendors failing to supply samples will be disqual ified from further consideration in the standardization process.  The CPT will evaluate Disposable Endo-Mechanical Devices products and recommend the preferred product based upon clinical evaluation of the products.  The CPT will evaluate the clinical crit eria using a Likert-like one to five rating scale from one (Does not meet minimum needs - worst score) to five (Offer superior clinical advantages - best score).  All clinical criteria are weighted equally.  Minimum clinical acceptability is considered a t otal average score of three or above on a five scale rating.   3.0 is the target acceptability threshold.  The CPT will analyze this acceptability as being at or near 3.0 depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered nea r the 3.0.  Below this threshold, products will be unacceptable clinically and not eligible for consideration for standardization and will not be considered further. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a com mitted volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches  for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-prici ng discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Central Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determine d to be necessary.           If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  However, the Government reserves the right to make two or more sel ections for RIAs based on the CPTs clinically preferred products. E. Technical Criteria Evaluation:  The Clinical Product Team (CPT) will review the following technical criteria responses from each vendor and determine acceptability.  Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical criteria includes responses to al l questions in this section that demonstrate the business concern offering the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of the subject medical/surgical consumables; and, based on the quoters responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line  or products and/or services offered m eet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. 1.	Company supplied DAPA number or DAPA log number documenting request for DAPA, with solicitation response. (0 = no; 5 = yes)  Note: a rating of zero on technical criteria number one will disqualify the vendor from further participation in this solicitati on. 2.

<DESC>1.  The U. S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) requests information from companies currently developing unmanned aircraft systems on the capabilities and technical maturity of your system(s).  Interested firms have the option to submit approaches to either one, two, three or all four of the UAS platforms described below.  Given the wide variety of harsh environments in which Special Operations Forces (SOF) must operate, SOF equipment requires critical design characteristics that are resistant to the potential detrimental effects of environmental conditions.  The intent of this RFI is to determine the readily available UAS capability  to withstand operations in maritime and/or austere environments.  Intended system employment is from maritime platforms to the extent that the UAV will withstand repeated landings in both fresh and salt water.  Details and requirements are listed below.
2.  This Request for Information is issued solely for market research and planning purposes. It is not a Request For Proposal (RFP), nor is there any commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract implied, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this request. No responses received will be used as a proposal.  All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party?s expense.  
3.  USSOCOM interest will be dependent on the results of the RFI capability assessment (including mission performance assessments) and USSOCOM operational requirements analyses and determinations.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on FedBizOpps.  Potentially, future purchasing agreements may be sought to obtain systems to perform more extensive evaluation.  Pending funding levels and the availability of technical mature systems, USSOCOM may procure up to approximately 40 Tactical 1-Micro (T1-M) systems, 80 Tactical 1?Small (T1-S) systems, eight Tactical 2 (T2) systems, and/or eight Tactical 3 (T3) systems to operate in maritime and/or austere environments commencing late FY08 through FY10.
4.  Broad industry participation is desired, but USSOCOM is keenly interested in designs that are currently in production or capable of rapidly entering into production (delivery within six months).  Firms interested in providing the UAS capabilities described must illustrate succinctly in a white paper how their system(s) can meet the following capabilities: (1) how it can meet the required system capabilities, anticipated delivery timeframes and Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) system cost estimates; (2) any recent and relevant past performance information illustrating fielded products designed and proven to work in the demanding corrosive seawater environment.  Special emphasis should be highlighted of systems capable of landing in and floating on water surfaces.  Contractors shall include relevant contract numbers, periods of performance, dollar value, corporate and reference points of contact, telephone numbers, and a synopsis of the work performed that is relevant to meeting the stated requirements; (3) current facility security clearance as approved in existing contracts or, if necessary, describe how required facility clearances for handling and working with unclassified controlled items would be established/maintained; and (4) current business size, a statement of capabilities, including available personnel; and a point of contact by name, address, and phone number.  The white paper response is not to exceed ten (10) pages.
5.  Interested firms are invited to submit their capabilities requirements, in writing, within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of this announcement, no later than (NLT) 2:00 PM local time to the Procurement Contracts Officer (PCO), Ms. Kim DeBois Sousa.  White papers must be sent to:  HQ UNITED STATES SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMAND, ATTN: SOAL-KW (Kim DeBois Sousa, PCO), 7701 Tampa Point Boulevard, MacDill AFB, FL, 33621, or e-mailed to: deboisk@socom.mil.  Questions regarding this RFI shall be submitted in a timely manner to the PCO.

Concerns that respond to this notice must fully demonstrate the capability to accomplish the above and are to supply pertinent information in sufficient detail to demonstrate a bona fide capability to meet the requirements. Inquiries/information received after the established deadline shall NOT be considered for this acquisition. The submission of this data for review shall not impede award of this contract.     The Government does NOT intend to pay for information solicited.     See Numbered Notes 12 and 22.     This synopsis is issued pursuant to FAR Part 6.302-1 and HSAM 3006.302-1.     For information regarding this acquisition, contact the Contracting officials listed herein.

<DESC>SPECIAL NOTICE TO:  Large healthcare providers in a hospital or clinical setting with a significant Release of Information (ROI) workload: Health Information Technology Prototype -- THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION AND NO CONTRACT AWARD WILL BE MADE AS A RESULT OF THIS POSTING.

INTRODUCTION:  The Social Security Administration (SSA) requests medical evidence to support the disability claims process.  Today, requests for medical evidence, along with the authorization to release information, are sent to the healthcare provider via mail or fax.  In turn, healthcare providers have multiple channels (mail, fax, web, and secure electronic transmission) to respond back to SSA with the medical evidence.

The Social Security Administration is interested in initiating a prototype project in the electronic exchange of standardized health information with healthcare providers.  The objective of the project will be to evaluate the feasibility, technical alternatives, and potential value of leveraging electronic communication along with structured clinical information with healthcare providers for the disability claims process.  A provider-based Electronic Health Record (EHR) will provide responses to electronic requests from SSA with no human intervention using standard electronic transactions transmitting structured clinical information, which could result in quicker decisions on disability claims.

The prototype capabilities required for consideration include the ability to respond to electronic requests for actual medical information through the Health Information Technology (HIT) Interoperability Standards and Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) transmission standards that include X12N and HL7 with the requested medical information data elements. The medical information data elements shall be formatted in the associated standards that shall be approved by Health Information Technology Standards Panel (HITSP) or be widely accepted in the Health Information Technology industry.  Examples of vocabulary standards include (but are not limited to) LOINC, CPT, HCPCS, ICD-9, ICD-10 and SNOMED CT. 

The prototype capabilities outlined above must be available for pre-production testing by April 2008.  

SSA is interested in hearing from large healthcare providers in a hospital or clinical setting with a significant Release of Information (ROI) workload that are interested in discussing this approach, alternative concepts, and opportunities to partner in this prototype.  Please submit your response directly to Debbie Somers at Debbie.somers@ssa.gov.

Background

In the Bureau for Global Health, the Office of Professional Development and Management Support (GH/PDMS) was created to carry out professional staff development, personnel, administrative and management functions for Global Health.  USAID has been using a series of non-direct hire (NDH) staffing mechanisms with the current mechanisms ending December 31, 2007 and September of 2008. USAID intends to award a new five-year cost plus fixed-fee contract to continue providing the necessary technical experts that are currently in place under the terminating mechanisms as well as anticipated additional placements over the next five years, both in Washington and in overseas locations.  Using NDH staffing mechanisms has enabled USAID to fill some of the critical skills gaps resulting from downsizing, hiring freezes, advent of new priorities and attrition of staff at various levels.  In addition, it has enabled USAID to supplement its direct-hire technical, professional and operational staff through contractor support in order to achieve USAID?s global health program priorities.  

Proposed Requirements

1.	Recruitment, Hiring, Placement

The Contractor shall provide direct services for the recruitment, hiring and support of experts to provide technical and managerial assistance to USAID?s programs at USAID Bureaus and Offices in Washington and in Overseas Regional Offices and Missions.  These services may include particular emphasis on high-priority areas as outlined under the above-mentioned seven Health program elements.  

Over a five-year period, approximately 200 institutional contractor placements are expected, with approximately 60% in Washington, DC, and 40% in developing countries overseas.  See the attached table for an illustrative list of countries where USAID may place personnel.  The institutional contractor staff will be hired as employees of the Contractor?s organization, and provide technical advice and management capabilities to USAID.  Institutional contractor staff shall serve as technical advisors and provide advice on technical matters, but shall not perform ?inherently governmental functions? or make final decisions or sign documents that commit the U.S. Government (defined in OMB Circular A-76).

The Contractor shall identify appropriate institutional contractor employees with the required expertise, availability, language proficiencies, and experience for each position identified.  These employees will provide technical and managerial assistance to USAID?s programs in Washington and field missions overseas.  In addition, some positions may include the following elements:  (1) to meet highly specialized technical needs; and, (2) for difficult-to-fill positions, either because of scarce labor markets or posts for which it is difficult to recruit.  While we expect this to be the exception rather than the rule, some placements may be requested on very short notice, e.g., two to four weeks, and rapid response will be essential to ensure the effectiveness of this contract.  

The institutional contractor staff will be predominantly mid-career or senior professionals in the public health sectors as called for in the SOW provided by the requesting Bureau, Regional Bureau, Regional Offices or Missions.  Institutional contractor staff will have educational and/or relevant work experience in fields related to public health, specifically with reference to the above-mentioned Elements.  Individual placements documents will outline levels of experience needed, e.g., working in specific or related discipline(s), including experience as it applies to international work, preferably in or with reference to developing countries.  

Recruitment requests shall contain the following:  position title, estimated market value, period of performance, place of performance, statement of work describing duties and responsibilities, desired start date, education/experience required for the position (including minimum criteria and preferred), selection (eligibility) factors and evaluation (knowledge, skills, and aptitude) factors.  Once given the request for recruitment, the Contractor shall post the position within its own organization and widely circulate the specific placement documents so as to access the widest range of qualified responders.  This may include, but is not limited to newspapers, electronic posting, list serves, general periodicals, sector-specific publications, trade shows, and other means as appropriate.

Once a qualified candidate has been selected for a position, the Contractor shall make all necessary arrangements for the placement of the institutional contractor employee. These hiring and placement tasks shall include but not necessarily be limited to:

?	Obtaining USAID salary approval from the CTO prior to making an official offer of employment;

?	Obtaining and maintaining the necessary security and personnel security               clearances through the Defense Security Service;

?	For overseas placements, ensure that the candidate and his/her dependents obtain appropriate direction and logistical support from the Contractor for transfer to the assigned country.  Handle all host country requirements for the candidate prior to deployment. USAID Missions may be consulted for information, but all logistics are the responsibility of the Contractor and institutional contractor?s employee; and,

?	Provide all new institutional contractor employees with an orientation to the Contractor?s organization, philosophy and personnel procedures, of a duration approved by the CTO and typically no more than three (3) days.  This orientation should also include a segment on USAID organization and philosophy and where appropriate information about overseas Mission.


2.	Transition of Staff from Previous Award

In addition to recruiting and hiring for new positions as they are identified, the Contractor will be responsible for the transition of approximately 80 institutional contractor staff from an expiring non-direct-hiring mechanism that is scheduled to end September of 2008.  Responsibilities include but are not limited to:

?X	Persons in positions will be given first right of refusal for the transferred positions;

?X	The CTO and the Contractor will collaborate to ensure the transition is seamless, efficient, expeditious, trouble-free and fair in terms of pay and benefits;

?X	USAID will include appropriate provisions that will allow for carry over of capped unused annual leave and sick leave that has accumulated under the expiring NDH mechanism.;

?X	The Contractor will provide the current employees with the same, or better, pay and benefits now being provided; and, 

?X	The Contractor will offer pay and benefits equivalent to what is provided to US Personal Services Contractors.  

3.	Backstopping

The Contractor shall provide all necessary support to Contractor employees and his/her dependent(s) for U.S. and overseas placements, ensuring that all provisions of applicable U.S. Government laws and regulations are observed as they relate to support, benefits, and allowances for overseas or domestic personnel.  Such laws and regulations related to support and allowance are limited to the U.S. Foreign Affairs Manual, U.S. Foreign Affairs Handbooks, and the U.S. Joint Travel Regulations, as amended.

6.	Reporting Requirements

A critical need under this contract is the financial reporting and cost accounting functions.  The Contractor must have a strong financial management and reporting system in order to provide the necessary financial reporting to USAID CTO, managers, USAID offices and field missions.  This contract will receive multiple sources of funding for its institutional contractor personnel, with some of the funds needing tracking for specific and special circumstances, such as the Results Review process, reporting against Congressional earmarks, for Country Operational Plans, forecasting for future needs, etc.  The Contractor shall establish and maintain financial and cost records for all the proposed, in-process and completed personnel placements.  Financial and cost records shall include all the direct and indirect charges, fees, and other requested cost elements such as required by GH Bureaus, Offices, Missions, USAID financial accounting, or Congressional earmarks to facilitate reporting of actual and proposed charges relative to the work carried out under this contract.  These records shall include work plans, schedules, budgets, and expenditures differentiated to present data relating to directed activities across the Bureau or Mission.  

The Contractor shall provide, on request, financial status reports that show the current status and balance of funds segregated by requesting Operating Unit and Element.  For planning, scheduling and financial accounting purposes, the Contractor shall develop a regular format for reporting on completed, in process and proposed placements under the contract.  By these reports, USAID contract managers and customer offices or missions must be able to determine the amount of funds provided to the contract and the amounts drawn down for each placement, expenditures to include pipeline analyses, etc.

The Contractor shall provide budgets, pipelines, and projected expenses for each placement to USAID supervisors and other USAID staff for financial planning and as requested by the CTO.  

7.	Database

There is a need for an innovative, flexible management tool designed to capture, organize, and analyze disparate contract data for timely program decision making and reporting, available on the Internet worldwide.  With the steadily increasing need of personnel, there is an urgent need for the development of more comprehensive methods of gathering and analyzing program data accessible to USAID and the contractor employees employed under this contract.  With placements also in USAID field missions overseas, USAID requires a tool that could capture and display contract data in a flexible, contextual format that contractor employees around the world could access quickly and securely from their own offices.  Therefore, the Contractor shall collaborate with USAID in creating and maintaining a common computer-based approach among USAID non-direct hire personnel management contracts and cooperative agreements to provide a computerized platform for tracking and reporting financial management and reporting methods, budget, and administrative duties.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR EXPRESSION OF INTEREST - HOT-ISOSTATIC PRESSING (HIP) TECHNOLOGY FEASIBILITY STUDY AT THE IDAHO NATIONAL LABORATORY (INL)

I. INTRODUCTION

Battelle Energy Alliance (BEA), Management & Operating Contractor of the Idaho National Laboratory (INL), is requesting an expression of interest from prospective candidates to assist in the assessment of Hot-Isostatic Pressing (HIP) technology as a viable alternative for processing various waste forms to be encountered during the Idaho Cleanup Project (ICP).

II. PURPOSES 

The purpose of this Request is to identify potential subcontractor candidates who have the requisite experience, capabilities, facilities and access to the resources required to assist BEA with an evaluation and demonstration of HIP technology as a viable method of addressing various wastes.  Qualified responders will receive a formal Request for Proposal for the scope of work summarized herein.  

III.  SCOPE 

This initiative will assist in the development of a technical evaluation of HIP as a potentially competent, deployable, and economically viable technology to address various wastes.  Of immediate interest is the feasibility of treatment and/or consolidation of various wastes including treatment of high level waste calcine, sodium bearing waste product, and diverse specialty wastes such as spent nuclear fuel debris.  

It is anticipated that the selected Subcontractor shall assist BEA in developing a proof-of-concept demonstration to illustrate the value of this technology as a future mission asset for the treatment of a wide variety of problematic wastes such as actinide wastes, cesium & strontium, fuel pond sludges, corroded fuel pins, and technetium.  The evaluation will address both the technical and regulatory risks associated with deployment of the technology to produce acceptable waste form(s) and associated cost estimates.  The work is tentatively scheduled to be performed in four phases: Phase 1 - Directed towards generation of simulated calcine representative of average aluminum and average zirconium calcine, containing RCRA heavy metals.  This simulated calcine material is required for waste form demonstrations under Phase 3; Phase 2 - Demonstrate proof-of-concept flexibility of HIP technology in combination with tailored waste form technology to immobilize a range of problematic wastes.  One to two surrogate samples will be prepared and key characteristics measured.  Certain surrogate wastes compositions or materials are to be provided to, or developed with, the INL; Phase 3 - Technical and regulatory analysis of HIP glass-ceramic waste forms for calcines, as well as evaluation of calcine consolidation via direct HIPing with no waste form additives; and Phase 4 (currently unfunded) - Process engineering overview including HIP industrial safety, technical maturity and rough order of magnitude costing for full-scale deployment.

IV. SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS 

Candidates shall provide brief statements of qualifications in the following areas:

1) A description of current experience, knowledge and capabilities directly applicable to the performance of the scope identified within Section III to this Request.

2) Provide a list of data rights, proprietary technology, and patients unique to HIP waste form technology.

3) Provide examples of previous HIP technology demonstrations for similar waste forms.

4) A minimum of two references who can validate HIP technology expertise.

Failure to provide the requisite submittals may result in the candidate being determined ineligible for receipt of a formal RFP.

Please provide your expression of interest to the undersigned by Close-of-Business, November 19, 2007.  If you have questions or need additional information, please contact Robert T. Crowton on Extension (208) 526-7746 or email robert.crowton@inl.gov.  Technical questions must be submitted in writing

<DESC>SUBJECT: R  SOURCES SOUGHT FOR EMERGING C4ISR TECHNOLOGIES POC:  Contract  Specialist, Rose Hussak,  Code 222,  Phone 619-553- 4501 The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center San Diego (SSC San Diego)  Applied Research Technology and Sensors Branch, Code 71730  is seeking qualified Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) sources that can provide services for identifying emerging technologies in our core mission area of Command, Control, Communication, Computers and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) and performing research, development, implementation, test and integration for successful transition to Department of Defense or related operational systems.  Sources are sought that can provide services including as many of the following attributes as possible, with a minimum entry criteria of demonstrated capability in at least two of the major thrust areas.  The C4ISR emerging technology work specifically includes Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Electronic Intelligence (ELINT), Image Intelligence (IMINT), Measurement Intelligence (MASINT), and Electronic Warfare (EW) technologies and systems.  The scope of the contemplated effort will include research and development involving both software and hardware, systems engineering, integration, testing, technical services, management services, and certification services.  The effort requires identifying requirements, program planning and execution necessary to implement and support current and emerging technologies (that is, to acquire, integrate, test, field, and sustain these technologies); identifying and implementing laboratory and facility enhancements required to evaluate these emerging technology advancements and determining current system limitations; providing support to SSC San Diego and performing work in systems engineering, integration and interoperability support for ashore and afloat experimental initiatives and DoD/Fleet modeling and simulation programs; and providing assessment, testing and evaluation of emerging C4ISR systems and related technologies determining operational utility.  This work must be conducted at the appropriate security level.  The effort will support S&T and RDT&E activities to determine patterns and associated observables of activities of difficult target sets.  Examples of such difficult targets include, but are not limited to: terrorists and insurgents, improvised explosive devices (IEDs), diesel electric submarines (SSKs), mobile missile transporter erector launchers (TELs), micro-satellites, and underground facilities.  The effort will determine existing sensors, future sensors, and pattern recognition algorithms that can be used to identify such targets and related activities. Specific areas to be considered are sensors, signals, sensor and data fusion, global pattern recognition, diverse data algorithms, handling of ambiguous and noisy data, sensor and data management, adaptation, reaction times, and innovative applications.  The sensors and signals effort area may include new or improved techniques for detecting, assessing, safeguarding, jamming, or otherwise exploiting RF communications links. Operations research and modeling will be applicable, as will rapid prototyping, testing, and software development and integration for appropriate environments and security levels.  A strong emphasis will be placed on department of defense and Fleet support for C4ISR upgrade and test, with demonstrated capability required in system engineering, integration, and interoperability support for ashore and afloat experimental initiatives and modeling and simulation programs assessment, and testing and evaluation of emerging C4ISR systems and related technologies as applied to operational utility among the Joint Services and Homeland Defense. Finally, the effort will require support for DoD Information Technology Security Certification and Accreditation Process (DITSCAP) development and support and other accreditation and certification support. This procurement is anticipated to be an indefinite quantity indefinite delivery (ID/IQ).  SSC-SD anticipates issuing a solicitation for a base year with four one-year options.  A minimum guarantee applies to the base period.  There is no minimum guarantee on the option years.  The estimated level of effort for the total requirement is approximately 185,000 man-hours.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541330, Small Business Size Standard $25 Million. It should be noted that any potential source will be required to have/or obtain personnel and facilities cleared up to the TOP SECRET Level. Performance will be at various federal sites worldwide, shore and shipboard, with many projects occurring simultaneously at multiple sites. The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to locate and identify qualified SDVOSB sources to determine if sources exist for a SDVOSB set aside.

Mode of operation is via high resolution, daylight, electro-optic sensors operated at low altitude (10,000 to 15,000) feet above ground level (A GL) with algorithm processed data presented for analyst review, target isolation and product dissemination.  While standard contract personnel and operational space and some logistics (fuel/lubricants) will be provided by the Government for operations Outs ide the Continental United States, the contractor shall provide the vast majority of the system deployment, operations, maintenance and support personnel, systems and materiel to achieve a minimum of 90% Operational Readiness rate, with an operational temp o of 150 daylight flight hours per month per aircraft.  The government does not own any of the data rights for the maintenance and operation of this system.  Interested contractors and personnel must be approved to operate within the environment defined fo r a Defense Security Service (DSS) cleared, Top Secret, Special Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) with appropriate facility clearance and SECRET safeguarding approvals. This research is for the purpose of obtaining information only.  No contract award or funding of any kind will occur as a result of this market research.  The lack of the submission of data at this time will not eliminate any firms participation in the fu ture competition if a competitive contract is assessed as possible by the Government through its review of information obtained on capabilities and products through this Market Research. Questions of a technical nature should be directed to the technical point of contact regarding this RFI: Major Gregory Gastan, e-mail gregory.gastan@us.army.mil. Market Research responses must be UNCLASSIFIED and sent via e-mail to the technical point of c ontact and the research manager, Mr. Terry Kuntz at e-mail terry.kuntz@us.army.mil by not later than 7 December 2007 in the format provided in the ICON below.

<DESC>The Alaska District Corps of Engineers intends to specify proprietary and/or sole source equipment known as Intelligent Parking Lot Controls (IPLC) developed and marketed by Vantera Incorporated, P.O. Box 334 Elie, MB R0H-0H0, Canada, www.iplc.com, f or Energy Conservation Improvement Programs and Construction Project at Various Army Post Locations, Alaska.  This is a sources sought and not a request for proposal.  No solicitation will be available, however, all submittals received within 45 days of th e publication will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete the requirement based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The product is a smart power receptacle that can  replace any existing parking stall power outlet. It incorporates a microprocessor, temperature sensors, and red and green LED lights to tell users the status of the system. It measures temperature and wind chill, and is factory programmed to automatically  regulate the optimum power flow to ensure strong starts at any temperature. The intelligent operation reduces electrical consumption and costs by up to 65 percent, or a full 30 percent more than competing systems.  Each IPLC handles two circuits and each outlet can be individually programmed to prevent use of in-car heaters, or to meet the special needs of  diesel engines or emergency vehicles. Each receptacle stores connection data that can be captured to assess use patterns. Red and green LEDs instantly tells users the status of the power outlet and their equipment, including: a live outlet, a functioning block heater, an open circuit in their block heater, a circuit overload from an in-car heater or a short circuit in the block heater.  The salient features of the product are  "	Automatically controls the amount of electricity supplied based on ambient air temperature and the wind chill factor "	Totally programmable via computer software to vary the fraction of electricity supplied based on temperature "	In-built microprocessor which keeps track of energy consumed with and without the use of the controller and provision to download data from the microprocessor "	Identify problem with open circuit and over load via LEDs or any other means "	Temperature rating of -55 ?C to 225 ?C "	Current rating of 25 Amps rms continuous and 200 Amps rms peak for one AC cycle The Alaska District Corps of Engineers request interested manufacturers to respond with their capabilities and marketing materials that identify the features of the equipment by email to kristine.g.stoehner@poa02.usace.army.mil, or to CEPOA-CT-CM, PO 6898,  Elmendorf AFB, AK  99506-0898.

<DESC>The Maine Air National Guard (MeANG) is seeking to identify interested sources for a project at the 101st ARW, Bangor International Airport, Bangor, Maine.  The project:  REPLACE AIRCRAFT PARKING APRON PHASES 1 AND 2, Performance period is anticipate d to be 180 days. The magnitude of this project is between $10,000,000 and $25,000,000.   The work involves all plant, labor, equipment and materials necessary to demolish and replace an existing parking apron.  The project includes the installation of app roximately 9,000 cubic yards of Portland Cement Concrete (PCC), 69,000 tons of Bituminous Cement Concrete (BCC), aircraft hydrant fuel system, drainage structures, deicing system piping and controls. This project will be solicited and awarded as a Best Value, Request for Proposal (RFP).   The solicitation package (W912JD-08-R-0001) will be published approximately 8 January 2008 with request for proposals due back approximately 22 February 2008. A site visit and Pre-proposal conference is scheduled for on or about 15 January 2008.   Actual dates and times will be identified in the solicitation The offers will be evaluated on past performance, technical ability (including such things as: quality control, schedules, sub-contractors, suppliers, etc.), and price.  Since the Air National Guard is seeking to minimize the risk of alkali silicate reaction (ASR), they will require the following testing procedures and results:  ASTM C 1260 and ASTM C 1567 with the following two test conditions:  (A) 1N sodium hydroxide at 80 degrees C for 28 days and (B) 6.4N potassium acetate at 80 degrees C for 28 days.  The limits for these tests at 28 days shall not exceed 0.08%. The testing must be done by an independent certif ied testing company. The course aggregates and fine aggregates will be tested in accordance with specification 32.13.11 Concrete Pavements for Airfield and Other Heavy Duty Pavements more than 10,000CY.   This section of the specification may be viewed at  the following web page: http://www.nationalguardcontracting.org/Ebs/AdvertisedSolicitations.asp.  Offerors must include test results and design mix in their proposal. The MeANG performed ASR screening tests using the protocol prescribed above and found that some coarse aggregates (marble and coarse grained granite) available within a reasonable haul distance from the project site meet the screening limits when blended w ith Class F low lime fly ash (CaO less than  3%) at a cement substitution rate of 25%.  The MeANG has also found that some coarse aggregates (quartzite and processed glacial deposits) when combined when Class F low lime fly ash at 25% did not pass the scre ening tests. All four of the local fine aggregate sources tested (glacial deposit) did meet the above-mentioned standard when tested with the addition of 25 % Class F low lime fly ash .  This sources sought advertisement is to help identify potential offerors and to give them enough notice so there will be adequate time for all testing and submission requirements. All information, amendments and questions concerning this solicitation will be electronically posted at the following web page: http://www.nationalguardcontracting.org/Ebs/AdvertisedSolicitations.asp . Interested contractors are encouraged to register.  For security reasons, all potential offerors, plan rooms and printing companie s are required to register in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), http://www.ccr.gov/   and the Federal Technical Data Solution (FedTeDS) https://www.fedteds.gov .

10)	support provisions for non-removable memory segments
11)	support rapid zeroization of selected (including all) RSM and static files/data
12)	support RSMs that contain different classification levels of data and the ability to access them independently over dedicated interfaces
13)	communicate with the mission computer and other avionics via Gig Ethernet (GbE) Bus interface(s)
14)	provide provisions for multiple Gig Ethernet interfaces
15)	support bootloading of avionics systems from files located in RMS
(b)	The RSM should provide some or all of the following features and/or characteristics:
1)	support pre-flight loading using standard widely used commercial interfaces (e.g. USB, Firewire, 10/100/1000 BaseT Ethernet, Fibre Channel, Ultra-SCSI, etc.) 
2)	be capable of being loaded and removed via an environmentally sealed door on the front of the MMU with or without power applied to the aircraft
3)	provide a minimum available capacity of 125 GB of non-volatile memory
4)	be scalable up to 500 GB of non-volatile memory
5)	support high speed zeroization

Nature and/or description of the action:   New contract for the replacement of the 20 licenses of Micro Focus Revolve Enterprise Edition (unlimited lines of code) and the 15 licenses of the Assembler add-on for Micro Focus Revolve with a 50 seat license of Micro Focus Revolve Enterprise Edition (unlimited lines of code) and an unlimited seat site license of the Assembler add-on for Micro Focus Revolve.  In addition, a special tailored class by the contractor, Micro Focus International plc, on the advanced functionality of the Enterprise Edition for 35 persons.  3.  A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value):   1.	50 seat license Micro Focus Revolve Enterprise Edition (unlimited lines of code); total approximate cost:  $187,500 with trade in of 20 existing licenses. 2.	Micro Focus Revolve Enterprise Edition with Assembler add-on, Unlimited seat cost is approximately:  $25,000 with trade in of 15 existing licenses. 3.	Revolve Enterprise Edition training (5 days) $3,000 per day, total cost: $15,000. 4.  An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.     "	41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements "	FAR 6.302-1 (c), application for brand name description 5.  A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.  This is an expansion of two products already in use at the Department of Veterans Affairs (hereinafter, "VA" or "Government") with refresher training.  These tools allow VA to analyze application source code in many unique ways.  The application source code consists of COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language) and Assembler, the tool natively examines COBOL code as its basic design and requires the Assembler Option to analyze the Assembler code.  The Micro Focus Revolve tool allows VA to search an entire application by job name, file name, variable name, literal name, statement types, program names, executions, uses (for example, where a copybook is used at, so if a code change is made to a copybook - how many and which programs must be re-compiled and re-certified), and text strings.  The Government requires a tool that allows for efficient developer time and to ensure all changes to the application made by developers are accurate and appropriate.  Based on market research, Micro Focus Revolve is the only known software that provides these essential functions and features.  The tool is specifically essential for all changes to the Personnel and Accounting Integrated Data (PAID) application which changes more than any other application daily.  In addition, it allows the following: "	To do a logical step through of a program's code (simulated run);  "	Flow diagram a paragraph, a section, a program, or a job;.   "	Display On Line Data Entry screens and their input/output fields; and.   "	Tell where dead (unused) code is, allowing VA to make the application more efficient and cost effective.   The Micro Focus Revolve Enterprise Edition (referred to as higher functionality) will give VA a predictability factor, for example a Date of Birth field were changed from year (4 digit) month (2 digit) day (2 digit) format to a julian date format year (4 digit) day (3 digit) - what would have to change, where it would have to change and the estimates for the cost in man-hours for that change.   The Revolve product is already in use and the transition from the licenses VA has to the 50 seat set will be seamless with a 20 minute maximum disruption of the individual seat(s) as the licenses are switched over.  Currently 38 users at the CFD require a Micro Focus seat license.  Micro Focus sells the Revolve Enterprise Edition license in 25-seat packs, therefore, the CFD requires the purchase of a 50 seat pack to cover the existing 38 users.  The remaining seats will be used by technical leads and managers for over site unless needed by new users.   The existing 15 seat Revolve Enterprise Edition with Assembler Add-on will be exchanged for an unlimited seat license, resulting in the Government not duplicating costs when required to add users.  The number of users has increased from 5 to 38 in the past year, using several different procurements.  By purchasing an unlimited seat license the Government will not duplicate the cost of reacquiring the existing licenses, nor the cost of procuring additional licenses in the future.  In addition the cost of maintenance subscription services (upgrades and technical support) is reduced with an unlimited seat license.  Fiscal Year 2007 annual maintenance for 15 Assembler Extension Option seats was $13,600, and had increased 9.98% from fiscal year 2006.  The cost of maintenance subscription services for an unlimited seat license is estimated at $10,000, $3,600 less regardless of the number of users added throughout time.   6.  A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.   A combined synopsis/solicitation will be issued in FedBizOpps as a small business set aside, the non-manufacturing rule applies. 7.  A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.   Negotiated costs will be based on available list prices and market research quotes previously obtained. 8.  A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.   Market research was conducted in the form of online searches, market research quotes, and previous procurement history in order to estimate the cost to the Government if the software was replaced.  Based on the online searches and previous procurement history the Government could not locate any other software manufacturers that provided software that meets the Governments requirements.  Estimates were based on the cost of replacing the existing system with Micro Focus licenses, since the Government is not aware of any other products that provide the same functionality.  A breakdown of the duplication of costs is provided below.  A quantity of 50 users was used for Assembler for the purpose of this estimate since the cost of an unlimited quantity is impossible.  The cost of maintenance for the Enterprise product is less when we upgrade because it is packaged at a quantity of 50, rather than the current maintenance that is priced separately by each package of 25. Total cost savings to the Government by upgrading the existing MicroFocus licenses is $167,127.50.  Assuming another manufacturer could provide similar functionality and assuming that the cost of similar technology would be at a similar license and maintenance cost, the trade in value of $143,357.50 would be lost and the Government's would not receive any savings in future maintenance costs.    9.  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as:  (i) Explanation of why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available.  (ii) When 6.302-1 is cited for follow-on acquisitions as described in 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), an estimate of the cost to the Government that would be duplicated and how the estimate was derived.  (iii) When 6.302-2 is cited, data, estimated cost, or other rationale as to the extent and nature of the harm to the Government.  The estimated cost savings to the Government is $167,127.50.  If the Government replaced the existing software it would cost an estimated $433,617.50; however by trading in the existing licenses for additional users the Government estimate is $266,490.00.  A breakdown is provided above in paragraph eight above.  In addition, the annual cost of maintenance will decrease by an estimated $23,770.00 each year.  While saving in the initial purchase and throughout each renewal year, the Government will also save in the cost of procuring additional licenses for the Assembler Option since an unlimited seat is being acquired.  The upgrade of the existing product is in the best interest to the Government based on the estimate of duplicating costs.  All estimates were developed from previous procurement of the licenses and maintenance in addition to market research quotes provided by Micro Focus. 10.  A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.    Sources will include authorized small business resellers of Micro Focus products since the non-manufacturing rule applies. 11.  A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.   The Government will send out periodic requests for information or sources sought notices once or twice before its time to renew maintenance.  And the end user will need to show the Contracting Officer, before the next maintenance renewal, that continuous market research was conducted to seek new sources for the software functionality. 12.  Certification requirement:  (Technical/requirements personnel must certify).  I certify the supporting data, including the statement of the Government's minimum needs and other rationale for other than full and open competition is complete and accurate to the best of my knowledge. _ David Roush /s/_                  ___________________________               ___11/8/07_____________ Signature of Technical/Requirements Representative                               Date This justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge and belief.  _Kari Cozzens /s/_______________________________________               __11/8/2007____________ Contracting Officer                                                                                          Date Procurements over $500,000 require approval from Competition Advocate.

    Section 835 of Public Law 107?296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ?more than 50 percent? for ?at least 80 percent? each place it appears.

    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held? 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107?296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107?296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:

    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.

(End of provision)

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  
The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>This amendment three extends the deadline for proposals/quotes to Friday, November 23, 2007 at 4pm ET and provides answers to the following questions:

1.       The Evaluation Criteria establishes that For this acquisition, technical capability is significantly more important that price.?  Could you please provide a more detailed description of the objective criteria that will be used to evaluate the offers?    The technical proposals will be evaluated against the statement of work to determine (1) if the offeror understands the requirement and (2) the methodology for filling the requirement.   The Government encourages innovative approaches to meeting this requirement.
 
3.      In order to present the complete proposal (SF 1449, technical specifications, corporate capabilities summary, past performance for similar projects and pricing, etc.), does each offeror need to be registered in the CCR Central Contractor Registration or is the tender open to the general worldwide business public?  Offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry to be eligible for award.
 
4.  Could you please provide us with a more detailed description of the differences between the data base "search" times, system "response" times, and fingerprint "transmission" times and the minimum requirements for each?  The RFP refers to a ?Response Time Requirement? (2 minutes for ten print searches and 15 minutes for latent searches).  By Response Time Requirement the USG means the time it takes the AFIS to provide a search response (hit, no hit, or candidate list) from the initial query ingestion.  Fingerprint transmission times will be a function of the telecommunications network as much as anything and; therefore, out of the control of the contractor.
 
5.  In addition to the seven remote data entry/query terminals described is there a requirement to provide the same functionality including live scan at the location of the main AFIS in the lab in San Salvador?  Yes.

6.  In the amendment 1, it has been indicated that the data base size will be:

Tenprint Records:     Not less than 600,000 records 
Palmprint Records:   100,000 records
Latent Records:          100,000 records 

Could you please indicate how many of the latent records will be finger latents and how many palm latents?  At present, there are no palm prints or latent palm prints.  We estimate that there will be approximately 60-75,000 finger latents and 10-15,000 palm latents.  These numbers are estimates only.

7.  Response 7 in Amendment 2 establishes a 99% accuracy specification for latent-to-tenprint searches and latent-to-palm print searches is this correct?   No, the Government modifies the latent accuracy specification rate to 75%.
