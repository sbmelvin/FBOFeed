<DESC><p>This notice is made in accordance with FAR Part 5.203 and will account for the 15 day pre-solicitation issuance requirement.&nbsp; The anticipated release for the solicitation is June 19, 2012.<br /><br />The Department of State, Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs in Beirut, Lebanon, has a requirement for a qualified contractor to&nbsp;provide and install a new&nbsp;countrywide 380-400 MHz LMR (Land Mobile Radio) system based on ETSI Tetra (Terrestrial Trunking Radio) standards, to provide wireless communications for the LISF (Lebanon Internal Security Forces) in the country of Lebanon (See attached&nbsp;"Envisioned Topology" Fig.1&nbsp;in the Statement of Work).&nbsp;All proposed systems shall use IP protocols and complete Open Architecture solutions; "Switched" or "Distributed".</p>
<p>The information and requirements of this SOW/Specifications document is for the main radio infrastructure (Control Rooms, Base stations/Repeaters, Controllers and associated hardware) only. Subscriber Terminals/Radios, fixed-end radio equipment and associated hardware will be part of a separate solicitation. The microwave equipment required to interconnect the LMR system and to support other functions required, will be provided separately by LISF. Any civil work (building, Greenfield site, or tower additions renovations and expansions), if identified, will be considered independently from this RFP by LISF.</p>
<p>The system should be highly reliable and fault tolerant, meeting the current requirements while providing growth capacity and a clear migration path for new emergent technologies without the need to replace major equipment elements. The system implementation shall be a multi-phased project, but only Phase-1 is to be considered for implementation at this time. (See attached Fig.2 in the Statement of Work).<br /><br />It is the intent of the Government to implement a radio communications infrastructure that includes the latest proven technology and meets the specified requirements for performance, coverage, and backup at a reasonable cost. The Contractor shall be responsible for providing a radio system that ultimately meets all functional and performance requirements of this SOW/Specification, including coverage, regardless of whether their final proposed radio system design reflects the same configuration of the conceptual design used as the basis of this document in terms of radio site selections and other system characteristics or is of a different design.</p>
<p>The system being installed must have a flexible infrastructure design to support without any constraints future data applications, additional sites and users beyond the initial identified requirements, as LISF intends in the future to expand locations and increase number of users. In the event of the loss of the system controller, the repeaters sites shall remain available for use. It is desired that operator positions retain full capability in the event of system controller loss.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Description/Specification/Statement of Work is attached to the Presolicitation.</p>
