<DESC>This is a solicitation for commercial items to be acquired under FAR 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for release of any amendments or other pertinent information. Solicitation FA8751-07-Q-0301 is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-17 and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement Change Notice (DCN) 20070531. See http://farsite.hill.af.mil/ for the full text of all provisions and clauses incorporated by reference herein. This procurement is being issued as a total small business set-aside under NAICS code 334515. The small business size standard is 500 employees.

The offeror shall provide the following items on a firm fixed price basis:

Manufacturer: Anritsu

Item 2: Simulation Kit
Qty: 1
Part No.: MX847010A

AFRL/IFGB has extensive existing hardware and software that is compatible only with an Anritsu platform. AFRL analysis software was custom made for this hardware platform. In order to preclude obsolescence and replacement, new hardware platform components must be of the same brand. No other brand meets the technical specifications and requirements.

The MD8470A Signaling Tester is used for mobile UE application development and supports processes required for application developments such as voice calling, packet communications including browser/contents download, video calling, and end-to-end UE communications (with a single MD8470A). The PPP server function is incorporated. The MD8470A Signaling Tester with the MU847040A TD-SCDMA Simulation Kit is a flexible, repeatable, and highly integrated TD-SCDMA/CDMA/GSM network simulation environment for technology developers. This allows users to perform testing and creation of devices, protocols, user equipment, and applications for TD-SCDMA/CDMA/GSM systems.

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate, Rome NY intends to solicit and negotiate a sole source purchase order under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 with Kemo Inc, 13183 Wexford Hollow Road N, Jacksonville FL 32224-8649 for the purchase of one (1) Filter/Amplifier System. Though this notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, information received within 15 days after date of publication of the solicitation will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The NAICS code is 334519.

SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION:     

AFRL/SNRT requires a product with a set of multichannel cards with high quality filters and amplifiers. The components requested from Kemo Inc are specified to an existing in-house Government designed experimental radar system. At this time Kemo is the only company producing a filter/amplifier system meeting the experimental radar receiver specifications. Kemo designed, validated, manufactured, and tested the filter/amplifier system to fulfill the Government program requirements. A company other than Kemo would have to complete the same process, which would result in a substantial and detrimental delay to the planned fielding of the radar system during summer 2007.

<DESC>The purpose of this effort is to provide analytical engineering studies to support the HH-60 Aircraft Structural Integrity Program (ASIP) as part of the overall Aging Aircraft Sustainment effort. This effort addresses those concerns through investigation of life predictions and failure analyses that are a direct concern of long-term aircraft use, consideration of corrosion effects that are seen on aircraft after a substantial time in service, consideration of the effects of new structure that has been added to the aircraft due to modifications and upgrades, and investigation of aircraft usage over its service life and the comparison of that usage to original design intent. This additional effort consisting of Loads/Environmental Stress Survey and Individual Aircraft Track (IAT) Development will compliment the existing generic ASIP program of the HH-60 program office, and will focus on identifying and solving HH-60 specific structural integrity issues listed in the Performance Work Specification associated with the 20+ year age of the aircraft.

Support directed under this contract also encompasses studies on the feasibility of future growth requirements and changes.  This support is required through completion of JPF production plus two additional years (estimated through FY12).  This effort is anticipated to be awarded under multiple contract types such as Time and Material and Firm Fixed Price for a period not to exceed 5 years.  This contract is anticipated to be an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.  Tasks include: studies and analyses related to current or projected enhancements to JPF system performance; simulation and modeling; evaluation of policy, budget, and parts obsolescence impact on production engineering baselines; analysis of technical issues arising between JPF production hardware and previously integrated weapon systems and/or aircraft; and inspection of non-warranty repair items and recommendations for repair, replacement, or scrap of non-serviceable assets.  This anticipated action is intended to provide a contractual vehicle to facilitate support tasks directly related to JPF production.  Kaman Dayron, Inc. is the only known company that has the detailed knowledge and expertise necessary to provide the required support; however, the Contracting Officer will consider responses from other contractors who express interest and capability to fulfill these requirements.  For contractual information concerning this synopsis, please contact Mr. Steve Wall, Contracting Officer, at (850) 882-3525 extension 3111.  For technical information, contact Mr. Michael Campbell, Program Manager, at (850) 882-3525 extension 2328.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from offerors or potential offerors.

When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Matters of a routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman but rather to the Contracting Officer, Contract Specialist, or the Program Manager.

<DESC>TITLE:  F-15 Electronic Systems Test Set (ESTS) Modernization Program BACKGROUND:  The F-15 ESTS Modernization Program is an Aeronautical  Systems Center (ASC) program.  The F-15 Electronic Systems Test Set (ESTS)  is an Intermediate  level support equipment system providing maintenance  & repair for approximately 50 F-15 Line Replaceable Units (LRU).  The  system consists of a station, Interface Test Adapters (ITA), ancillary  equipment, and associated cables located at all F-15 operating locations  and the depot at Robins as well as Northrop-Grumman, Rolling Meadows, Ill.  The station (62 units) itself will become increasingly difficult to  maintain and ultimately unsustainable beginning in FY08 unless known  obsolescence for a variety of component parts is addressed.  A projected  component obsolescence analysis is attached for reference purposes. PURPOSE:  The F-15 Systems Group, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is conducting a  survey to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise,  capabilities, and experience to analyze ESTS station instrument  obsolescence as currently fielded, identify potential solutions for same,  and demonstrate capability to replace obsolete parts as necessary.  The  overarching program objective is to avoid stations becoming Not Mission  Capable (NMC).  The government plans to issue, at a later date, a request  for proposal that will require offerors to provide a plan that provides  retrofit hardware improvements addressing obsolete parts within the  planned funding profile and meets the overarching program objective.  The  planned funding profile is as follows:  FY08 - $4.5M, FY09 - $12.1M,  FY10 - $13.4M, FY11 - $19.6M.  Respondents should maximize addressing the  projected component obsolescence issues within the planned funding  profile, i.e., address as many components as possible with the given  amount of funding.  In addition, offerors will be required to demonstrate  improvement to station MTBF as well as meeting the current performance  requirements.  In order to assist respondents with replying to this  sources sought synopsis a draft Statement of Objectives (SOO) is attached. CONTRACTOR CAPABILITY SURVEY:  Firms responding to this announcement  should indicate whether they are a large or small business, small  disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business, HUB Zone small  business and/or service disabled veteran-owned small business.

<SUBJECT>A--Notice of Intent to Sole Source - In Vitro Dermal Penetration Tests for Lipophilic Compounds

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE, NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION. EPA intends to issue a simplified acquisition to DuPont Haskell Laboratory for Health and Environmental Sciences of Newark, Deleware to conduct in vitro dermal penetration tests for lipophilic  compounds. Haskell has conducted these kinds of tests for lipophilic compounds in a partnership program between the EPA Office of Toxic Substances (OTS) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) under a Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Section 4 test rule. This rule requires  in vitro skin testing for a variety of industrial chemicals (EPA, 2004a). In conducting these tests Haskell has acquired unique experience regarding the dynamics of dermal absorption of lipophilic compounds and the proper approach to test them in vitro. This experience provides invaluable insight  into the chemical characteristics and the appropriate in vitro testing procedures that will yield measurements of chemical penetration through skin and permits the ability to estimate a permeability coefficient (Kp) for the tested compounds. Other laboratories can conduct in vitro dermal absorption  tests but none to EPA's knowledge has the experience and skill to successfully test lipophilic compounds in vitro.   FAR 13.106-1 states, "For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines the  circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available."  Due to the the unique qualifications of the suggested vendor, this simplified acquisition will be conducted on a sole source basis.    The period of performance is expected to be from July, 2007 through January, 2008.      All interested parties who believe they can provide the required services should fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 15 days from the date of this announcement.     The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any source(s) exist and, therefore, no RFQ is  available.  Consequently, any response(s) failing to provide the aforementioned data but instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will not be honored.     All responses must be submitted to the Contracting Officer at schermerhorn.eric@epa.gov

<SUBJECT>A--Intent to Sole Source - Development of Standardized marine/Estuarine Benthic Indicators for California, Oregon, and Washington
<SOLNBR>RFQ-RT-07-00188
<RESPDATE>062607
<ARCHDATE>07262007
<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Rebecca Clausen, Purchasing Agent, Phone (919) 541-3002
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency intends to award a sole source procurement to the Southern California Coastal Waters Research Project Authority, Costa Mesa, CA for the effort as described below.  Background:  Benthic indicators are used to assess the ecological condition of near-coastal and estuarine ecosystems, and such indicators are often central in management decisions on the suitability of dredge materials, NPDES permitting, Superfund, remediation, and regional assessments conducted under EPA's National Coastal Assessment (EMAP) program. However, as  stated in EPA's "National Coastal Condition Report II" (NCCR II, US EPA, 2004), "there is currently no single benthic community index applicable for the entire West Coast." In lieu of a standard benthic index, both NCCR II and NCCR III were forced to use deviations from a diversity-salinity  regression as the benthic indicator with the caveat that "Results should be interpreted cautiously because there is only a moderate concordance between lower species richness and indices of water quality or sediment quality."  The EPA is proposing to address this gap by building on ongoing work to  develop sediment quality objectives (SQO) by the State of California.  This California State effort offers the EPA a unique opportunity to develop benthic indicators for the Pacific Coast in timely fashion based on data and approaches that have undergone extensive technical and regulatory review.   The technical development of the California SQOs is being conducted by the Southern California Coastal Water Research Project (SCCWRP).  The overall goals of this contract are for 1) SCCWRP to provide their existing proprietary benthic and environmental data set to EPA; 2) use same approaches to  further develop this data set for Oregon and Washington; 3) using these data to calculate and analyze four types of benthic indicators that they are evaluating for the State of California; 4) contact/coordinate with states and federal agencies in Oregon and Washington regarding data availability  and the application of the California indicators to Oregon and Washington; 5)  write a final report on the potential application of the California benthic indicators to Oregon and Washington. A critical component of this contract shall be for SCCWRP to provide to EPA a standardized data set  consisting of marine/estuarine benthic species abundances and associated environmental data. This standardized data set shall be used by SCCWRP to calculate the four benthic indicators they have developed for the State of California (under Task B) and used independently by the EPA to evaluate a  different suite of benthic indicators. SCCWRP shall provide to EPA their existing data set that they have developed for the State of California.  This proprietary data set consists of several thousand records, covering studies dating back to the 1970s.  Much of the data were originally collected  by SCCWRP in Southern California, and these raw data are available only through databases maintained by SCCWRP.   In addition to the data collected by SCCWRP, their data set includes samples from other benthic surveys conducted in California. This compilation is a unique data source that has taken  several years to compile.  The circumstance permitting Other than Full and Open Competition Justification is FAR 6.301-2, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements" due to the proprietary nature of the data to be used by SCCWRP.  The period of  performance is expected to be from July 2007 for twenty months.  All interested parties who believe they can provide the required services should fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 15 days from the date of this announcement.  The intent of this synopsis is to  determine if any source(s) exist and, therefore, no RFQ is available.  Consequently, any response(s) failing to provide the aforementioned data but instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will not be honored.

<SUBJECT>66 -- C13 Hypersense DNP Polarizer
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-NCI-70066-NG
<RESPDATE>062107
<ARCHDATE>07062007
<CONTACT>Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 402-4509, Fax (301) 402-4513, Email holdcram@exchange.nih.gov - Renita Smith, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-496-8612, Fax 301-480-0241, Email rs442i@nih.gov
<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) plans to procure on a sole source basis the purchase of a C13 Hypersense DNP Polariser which includes the HyperSense installation/starter pack and solid state detector; with Oxford Instrument America, Inc; 300 Baker Avenue, Suite 150; Concord, MA 01742.  

This acquisition will be conducted under the procedures for acquiring commercial items authorized in FAR Part 12 and under the authority to use simplified procedures for commercial requirements as provided in FAR 13.501.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  

The salient characteristics apply to the C13 Hypersense DNP Polariser and inclusions: Dimensions: Height  2860 mm or 113 inches; Width  1668 mm or 66 inches; Depth 1038mm or 41 inches. 

C13 Hypersense DNP Polarizer:

-	low temperature (<3.4 K) polarizer using the Trityl radical for use in animals and humans;
-	interaction under extremely low temperatures (1.4 - 3.4 K) of the dynamic polarization transfer from the electron to 13C or 14N labeled compounds;
-	unpaired electron (in the Trityl radical) must be polarized using a 94 GHz microwave source and temperatures < 3.4&#9702; K must be maintained to achieve optimal spin polarization transfer.
-	94 GHz microwave source with 0.5 GHz sweep and a power output up to 180 mW;
-	3.35 Tesala actively shielded magnet operating at 4.2 Kelvin;
-	able to set polarizer sample temperature to < 3.9 Kelvin and  1.4 Kelvin at 180 mW;
-	helium consumption during dissolution must be < 2 Liter per dissolution

Justification:  

The NCI is developing new imaging modalities to study physiological responses of tumors and normal tissues to radiation and chemotherapy drugs. The HyperSense DNP Polariser is a means of detecting C13 labeled compounds using MRI pulse sequences.  Using C13-labeled pryuvate in conjunction with this instrument will enable the NCI to follow the production of lactate in tumor and normal tissue both before and after exposure to ionizing radiation.  Lactate production has been shown to be a good indicator of hypoxia and tissue response to cytotoxic agents.  The hyperpolarization of the C13 labeled compounds will allow for the unprecedented detection of these compounds in in-vivo systems (mouse, rabbits and eventually humans) using standard MRI pulse sequences. The ability to use this instrument in animal models should provide important information that will lead to human clinical trials.

Oxford Instruments worked closely with GE Medical to produce the Hypersense instrument to work with the proprietary Trityl radical, which is needed to activate the 13C-labeled pryuvate so that the appropriate metabolic by-products can be followed. It is not known to the NCI that any other manufacturer has access to the Trityl radical and hence is unable to make this instrument.

This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI contracting office by 1:00 PM ET on June 21, 2007.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.    Please reference NCI-70066-NG on all correspondence.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 					W911QX-07-R-0011	 1.  The Directed Energy and Power Generation Division (DEPGD) of the US Army Research Laboratory (ARL) has been tasked by the Armys Research Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM) to investigate the feasibility of developing Radio RF DEW concepts fo r Army applications, such as counter mine/booby trap, counter munitions, vehicle/area self-protect and air defense. ARL is also responsible for researching, designing and developing the technology necessary to build concept demonstrators and helping RDECOM  evaluate their effectiveness.  If an RF DE concept is deemed feasible and practical by RDECOM, then ARL transitions the technology to an appropriate Army Program Manager via the appropriate Research, Development and Engineering Center (RDEC).       To investigate the feasibility of an RF DEW concept, it is necessary to first determine the RF field strength and/or power density that must be incident on a target system to produce electronic upset and/or damage sufficient for a functional kill (i. e., target effects/susceptibility level). These target susceptibility levels are then combined with the users desired target engagement range to develop power/energy and system requirements for RF DEW concepts. Based on these requirements, a survey of RF source technology (i.e. transmitters, antenna, power supplies, etc) is conducted to determine if the current technology meets the requirements or whether gaps exist that must be addressed. If possible, breadboard systems are developed to show proof of prin ciple and to provide the basis for RDECS to further develop and transition to program managers (PMs). Finally ARL helps the RDECs/PM evaluate the effectiveness of the concept by conducting both analytical and experimental investigations as needed. 2.  This requirement is solicited as a basic Request for Proposals (RFP) with opportunities for offerors to respond to individual Sample Task Order Statements of Work attached in Section J.  These Sample Task Orders correlate to the Statement of Work found  in the RFP in Section C.  Sample Task Order Statements of Work numbers  1, 2, 3, and 6 are setaside for small businesses under the NAICS 541710, 500 employees standard.  Sample Task Order Statements of Work (SOW) numbers  4, 5, 7, 8 and 9 are being solici ted on a full and open competititive basis.   Offerors may propose against as many of the Sample Task Order SOWs it believes it has the capability to perform in the context of the business size limitations for each Sample Task.  The Government may award co ntract(s) with differing ceilings in them relative to its belief of the utility for each of the contracts awarded; however no individual contract will have a ceiling greater than the $3M estimated to be obligated over the term of this effort. Offerors are strongly encouraged to carefully review the Section L material so that a proposal may be properly prepared in response to this RFP.  Moreover, offerors should carefully study the evaluation criteria contained in Section M of this solicitation so that the e valuation scheme to be employed upon receipt of proposals by the Government is thoroughly understood as well.   3.  The period of performanc is five (5) years after award of contract.  A Cost Plus Fixed Fee Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity with Task Orders type of contract is anticipated.    4.  All Contractor/Subcontract personnel performing under this contract working at ARL shall be required to be United States citizens.  All Contractor/Subcontractor personnel performing under this contract must have a favorably completed/adjudicated (clear ed) National Agency Check (NAC) investigation prior to working on the installation.  Some future Task Orders issued may have individual Security Requirements particular to the instant task as well .     6.  This summary is provided solely as an administrative convenience.  It is not intended in any way to alter the terms an d conditions of this RFP.  Any inconsistency between this Ececutive Summary and the RFP shall be resolved in favor of the RFP.

The Air Armament Center (AAC) Joint Programmable Fuze (JPF) Program Office, 679th Armament Systems Squadron, plans to contract with Kaman Dayron, Inc. for continued technical support that will provide JPF with engineering, production, management, and logistics support required to ensure technical baselines remain current and effective.  Support directed under this contract also encompasses studies on the feasibility of future growth requirements and changes.

This effort is anticipated to be awarded under multiple contract types such as Time and Material and Firm Fixed Price for a period not to exceed 5 years.  This contract is anticipated to be an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.  Tasks include: studies and analyses related to current or projected enhancements to JPF system performance; simulation and modeling; evaluation of policy, budget, and parts obsolescence impact on production engineering baselines; analysis of technical issues arising between JPF production hardware and previously integrated weapon systems and/or aircraft; and inspection of non-warranty repair items and recommendations for repair, replacement, or scrap of non-serviceable assets.  This anticipated action is intended to provide a contractual vehicle to facilitate support tasks directly related to JPF production.  Kaman Dayron, Inc. is the only known company that has the detailed knowledge and expertise necessary to provide the required support; however, the Contracting Officer will consider responses from other contractors who express interest and capability to fulfill these requirements.  For contractual information concerning this synopsis, please contact Mr. Steve Wall, Contracting Officer, at (850) 882-3525 extension 3111.  For technical information, contact Mr. Michael Campbell, Program Manager, at (850) 882-3525 extension 2328.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from offerors or potential offerors.

Matters of a routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman but rather to the Contracting Officer, Contract Specialist, or the Program Manager.

<DESC>TITLE:  F-15 Electronic Systems Test Set (ESTS) Modernization Program BACKGROUND:  The F-15 ESTS Modernization Program is an Aeronautical  Systems Center (ASC) program.  The F-15 Electronic Systems Test Set (ESTS)  is an Intermediate  level support equipment system providing maintenance  & repair for approximately 50 F-15 Line Replaceable Units (LRU).  The  system consists of a station, Interface Test Adapters (ITA), ancillary  equipment, and associated cables located at all F-15 operating locations  and the depot at Robins as well as Northrop-Grumman, Rolling Meadows, Ill.  The station (62 units) itself will become increasingly difficult to  maintain and ultimately unsustainable beginning in FY08 unless known  obsolescence for a variety of component parts is addressed.  A projected  component obsolescence analysis is attached for reference purposes. PURPOSE:  The F-15 Systems Group, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is conducting a  survey to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise,  capabilities, and experience to analyze ESTS station instrument  obsolescence as currently fielded, identify potential solutions for same,  and demonstrate capability to replace obsolete parts as necessary.  The  overarching program objective is to avoid stations becoming Not Mission  Capable (NMC).  The government plans to issue, at a later date, a request  for proposal that will require offerors to provide a plan that provides  retrofit hardware improvements addressing obsolete parts within the  planned funding profile and meets the overarching program objective.  The  planned funding profile is as follows:  FY08 - $4.5M, FY09 - $12.1M,  FY10 - $13.4M, FY11 - $19.6M.  Respondents should maximize addressing the  projected component obsolescence issues within the planned funding  profile, i.e., address as many components as possible with the given  amount of funding.  In addition, offerors will be required to demonstrate  improvement to station MTBF as well as meeting the current performance  requirements.

<DESC>BWXT Pantex (Pantex), a government-owned, contractor-operated facility located in Amarillo, TX, for the Department of Energy?s National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), is preparing a solicitation to provide construction services to upgrade Pantex?s electrical distribution system.    
The Pantex Plants electrical distribution system is an electrical network that supplies electricity throughout the plant and in outlying areas of the Pantex Plant near Amarillo, Texas.  Electricity is a required utility as the Pantex Plant relies on electrical power to perform the essential functions of the Plant.  The objective of the EDSU project is to replace approximately 19 miles of overhead power lines (includes the removal of 704 existing poles and installation of 549 new poles) and 1 mile of underground conductors; replace 9 generators and 4 UPS with 4 new generators and 2 UPS; and to replace 12 panel boards and 2 air conditioning units.
This project shall provide turnkey Contractor services for Pantex. These services shall be for the equipment / material procurements, construction, start-up testing, plant personnel training, and completion of project closeout documentation (such as submittal of as-built drawing ?mark-ups?) for the EDSU project.
The scope of this project consists of two major tasks:  (1.) Generator /UPS /Panel board /HVAC Replacement (GUPHR), and (2.) Overhead-Electrical-Power-Line-Replacement (OEPLR).  The OEPLR task shall upgrade most of the Plant?s aging overhead electrical power poles. In addition to power poles, lighting poles will also be replaced in several locations.   The scope of both tasks includes disconnecting operating facilities and reconnecting power.
The successful contractor will be required to submit a cutover strategy plan that identifies how electrical power will be provided to facilities during construction activities and how electrical power will be cut over from the existing system to the new.  The new lines shall be installed such that both systems (new & existing) can remain operational independently &/or connected together. The maximum duration for facility outage to perform the actual cutover is limited and will complicate the execution.

EXPECTED RFP DATE IS JUNE 18, 2007
EXPECTED AWARD AND START DATE IS SEPTEMBER 30, 2007

ALL QUESTIONS, WHETHER TECHNICAL OR CONTRACTUAL, MUST BE SENT ELECTRONICALLY TO MIKE ALBERS, JALBERS@PANTEX.COM     IF YOU WILL BE RESPONDING TO THIS SOLICITATION, YOU MUST SUBMIT AN EMAIL TO JALBERS@PANTEX.COM ACKNOWLEDGING YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THIS SOLICITATION.     IF ANY QUESTIONS SHOULD ARISE, YOU WILL BE NOTIFIED ELECTRONICALLY. 

The purpose of this sources sought notice is to assist Pantex in preparing a list of qualified suppliers to whom to send the formal solicitation.     Interested suppliers, after having reviewed this sources sought, should submit to Pantex a statement of qualifications (SOQ), consisting of no more than two (2) pages, that describes the supplier's experience and capabilities in terms of Generator/UPS/Panel board/HVAC Replacement and Overhead Electrical Power Line Replacement of similar systems.     Suppliers must submit their SOQs to Mike Albers at jalbers@pantex.com no later than June 15, 2007

<CONTACT>Kurt Weilbaecher, Contracting Officer, Phone 228-688-2825, Fax 228-688-3153, Email kurt.weilbaecher@noaa.gov
<DESC>REQUIREMENTS:
This requisition is to provide continuing, uninterrupted Iridium RUDICS service for 84 currently active Iridium modems and to activate approximately 14 new modems over the next 12 months. The present Iridium services, provided through STRATOS, is an extension of existing Iridium services previously established by the Pacific Marine Environmental Lab (PMEL) in support of the Deep Ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART) buoy project.

RATIONALE FOR SOLE SOURCE:
Unless another Iridium VAR can provide seamless transition of active accounts from STRATOS with having to physically replace the existing STRATOS Iridium SIM cards, the costs to visit each active DART buoy immediately would be prohibitive. If the transfer is to be performed over the scheduled 2-3 year service period, the costs and procedural changes necessary to maintain two separate VARs during the transfer of all active accounts would be unduly cumbersome and burdensome on the government.

<DESC>RFP was posted 6/11/07. Proposals due 7/10/07. 

The Department of State (DOS) has a current requirement for telecommunications cable system design, installation and testing services. We anticipate awarding four  IDIQ (Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity) contracts .  Each contract will have a 12-month base year plus four 12-month Options. The contract ceiling is $2M per contract over 5 years.  Estimated  performance start date is June 2007.

The delivery orders will usually be for testing installed telecommunications cables systems at US Embassies and other diplomatic posts around the world but may require design and installation of systems at overseas posts on an infrequent basis.  The offer must be able to provide a Registered Communications Distribution Designer (RCDD) Archetect, A RCDD engineer and experienced Senior and Junior technicians.

This is a 100% small business set-aside.  The NAICS code is 541380 and the small business size standard is $11M.

In order to be considered for award of this contract, interested offerors, including all entities which comprise a joint venture, and the joint venture itself, must possess a Defense Security Service (DSS) Final Secret, Interim Top Secret or Final Top Secret facility clearance (FCL) with Secret safeguarding capability, issued in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), DoD 5220.22-M. At least two contracts will be awarded to firms currently possessing Interim or Final Top Secret FCLs, while firms with Final Secret FCLs may be selected for one or more additional awards.  Offerors must submit their appropriate Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code with the required qualification documentation.
Selected firms possessing a Final Secret FCL will be sponsored by Department of State for an FCL upgrade to the Top Secret level. Sponsorship does not guarantee that the firm will receive the upgraded clearance. A period of 90 days from the date of selection for award will be allowed for the Secret cleared firm to obtain an Interim Top Secret FCL.  After this period, the Government may, at its discretion, consider not awarding the contract to the selected offeror.
Due to time constraints, the Government will not delay award of contracts to selected firms already in possession of Interim and Final Top Secret FCLs.  Contractor personnel requiring access to classified information or Controlled Access Areas (CAA) must possess Secret or Top Secret personnel security clearances issued by DSS prior to performance on the contract.

Datron Advanced Technologies offers unique qualifications in the following areas that are considered essential to the requirement.  These unique qualifications include:   1)  L3 Datron is the vendor for the current 10 meter system in operations.  The GSC and related software control this very complex and is highly integrated into this system;   The 10 meter antenna must maintain very exacting pointing angles, implemented through the GSC, to insure that the spacecraft will remain in the beam width for both receiving data and transmitting data.  Since the GSC and other related software are not being replaced, this would prevent another vendor from fulfilling this requirement;  2)  Only the HPA is being replaced.  The GSC and HPA interface is tightly integrated into the existing system and the technical details of the interface are of a proprietary nature.  This would prevent another vendor from fulfilling this requirement by providing the HPA separately.  Based on the information available at this time and in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(i), the government considers the item specified as a sole source from Datron Advanced Technologies Simi Valley, CA and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm on that basis.

One project is envisioned which will provide the continued operation of the Alcohol Policy Information System (APIS).  

The APIS web site (http://alcoholpolicy.niaaa.nih.gov) is an online resource that provides public access to detailed information on a wide variety of alcohol-related public policies.  Intended primarily as a tool for researchers, APIS features compilations and tabulations of alcohol-related statutes and regulations.  APIS is designed to simplify the process of ascertaining the status of the law for researchers who wish to study the effects and effectiveness of alcohol-relate policies.

APIS inaugurated its public web site in June 2003.  Since that time it has been updated on a continuous basis to add new policy topics, update information on policy topics previously covered, add new features and capabilities, and clarify or correct previously published information.  Additional information about alcohol-related public policies is available through the links on the APIS Homepage. (http://alcoholpolicy.niaaa.nih.gov)

APIS contributes to the mission of the NIAAA by publishing data on line that supports research to (1) assess the effects of alcohol-related policies, both individually and in combination, on a wide variety of important health, social, and economic outcomes, and (2) identify and evaluate factors that enhance or inhibit the effectiveness of these policies.

Requirements and Tasks:  The purpose of the APIS project is to continue the publication on the APIS web site of accurate, authoritative, detailed, and comparable information on alcohol-related public policies at both the State and Federal level

(2) describing alcohol-related policies at several levels of detail, including descriptive overviews and detailed characterizations of specific policy provisions, (including the specific dates on which such provisions became or ceased to be effective); 
(3) storing the policy information, including all related descriptions, keywords, indicators, and variables in an electronic system that permits on-line search and retrieval of policy information by a variety of flexible criteria; 
(4) operating and maintaining the APIS web site; and, 
(5) implementing and employing rigorous quality assurance procedures to ensure the utility, reliability and integrity of the system and its various components.  

Information Requested: Submitted information should be relevant and specific to the technical area under consideration on each of the following qualifications: (1) Experience: An outline of previous work specific to the requirements and tasks listed above; (2) Personnel: Name, professional qualifications and specific experience of scientists and/or technical personnel who may be assigned as principal investigator and other key positions; and (3) Facilities: Availability and description of facilities and equipment required to conduct the analyses. (4) Other: Any other specific and relevant information that would improve the Government's consideration and evaluation of the information presented is desirable.

The Capability Statements must:

(2)  Demonstrate experience with operating a public web site. 
(3) Demonstrated experience with quality assurance procedures for a public web site.
(4)  Demonstrate and document past performance, in any capability statements submitted, and extensive experience with and the ability to perform the above tasks. 
(5)  Demonstrate organizational capability to administer and coordinate interrelated tasks in an effective and timely manner. 

Past Performance Information:  Documentation should include, but not be limited to, a minimum of five contracts (performed for both Government and commercial organizations) references which shall include for each contract: names, titles, contract number, price or cost, the Statement of Work, telephone numbers of Project and Contracting Officers, and any other information serving to document the organization's capability to perform the five tasks.

<SUBJECT>R -- National Acute Hazardous Substances Release Surveillance
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award, on a sole source basis, a purchase order to Texas Engineering Station, 301 WE RC Bldg, College Station, Texas 77843. The authority for this sole source procurement is FAR 13.106-1.  The purchase order is for procuring a National Acute Hazardous Substances Release Surveillance Implementation Plan.   
A program peer review of the ATSDR Hazardous Substances Emergency Events Surveillance System (HSEES) was conducted in 2005. Among the recommendations was that in order for the program to have more impact nationally on hazardous substances releases and their related public health consequences, an expanded focus is necessary. Since the program peer review, ATSDR staff have begun to develop this expanded focus.  Staff have developed a vision statement and a draft implementation plan, and have also begun to meet with a limited group of stakeholders.

In order to develop the broad national program as recommended by the Agency's external Board of Scientific Counselors, we require the assistance of a contractor with extensive knowledge of databases containing information on acute hazardous substances releases, and with access to stakeholder groups in the transportation and chemical industries and other government agencies.
The purpose of this project is to obtain contractor assistance in convening two meetings resulting in the production of a white paper describing the steps needed for the broad implementation of a national acute hazardous substances release surveillance program.  The first  small group meeting will include approximately 5 key stakeholders who will draft a focused white paper on the status of national acute hazardous substances release surveillance and prevention metrics. This draft white paper would be the basis for the second meeting, a 2-day roundtable meeting of approximately 20 selected stakeholders. The contractor would host the roundtable meeting and from this meeting produce  the white paper to include final recommendations describing the best possible methodology for surveillance of hazardous substances incidents in the US and details on the development and application of safety metrics. This white paper would be the basis for decisions about the implementation of the national acute hazardous substances release surveillance program at a later meeting.

1.Responsibilities of the Government: confirm planning committee and roundtable participants proposed by contractor,participate in committee and roundtable meetings and review and comment on white paper and final recommendations of roundtable. 2.Responsibilities of the Contractor: arrange and host small group meeting to develop white paper draft prior to August 2007 roundtable meeting, provide logistic support for 5 key stakeholders and produce a white paper and have it reviewed and approved by ATSDR prior to August 2007. 3.Roundtable Meeting:  arrange and host a 2-day roundtable meeting of approximately 20 stakeholders in August 2007 and provide logistic support for approximately 20 stakeholders. 4.Produce white paper: produce white paper to be reviewed and approved by ATSDR by September 30, 2007 and attend ATSDR national conference in FY2008 to present draft white paper. 5.Deliverables: the contractor shall provide an electronic version of the white paper with final recommendations describing the best possible methodology for surveillance of hazardous substances incidents in the US and details on the development and application of safety metrics. This document shall be updated with suggestions from the roundtable meeting and presented to ATSDR in final hardcopy and electronically by September 30 2007. The white paper will also be presented at the ATSDR National Conference in late 2007.
No deviations, changes, modifications, or revisions to this scope of work are authorized without the approval of the ATSDR Project Officer or Principal Investigator.
ATSDR will notify the contractor if any revisions to the project are necessary.

Period of Performance (Task/Delivery Order Contract):  The period of performance for the Basic Contract is 12 months from the date the contract is issued.
This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available. Firms that believe they can provide the instrument are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 15 days of the publication date of this synopsis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining to conduct a competitive procurement.

<SUBJECT>59 -- Ultra-DNE MCU2 Converter
<DESC>It is the intent of this agency to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c)(1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  United States Central Command (USCENTCOM)/CCJ6 requires a signal converter that converts conditioned diphase signals (CDI) to non-return to zero signals (NRZ).  The UltraDNE MCU2 provides expanded capability and redundancy in the event of circuit failure.  

This agency intends to award to DNE Technologies, 50 Barnes Park North, Wallingford, CT 06492.  DNE Technologies and UltraDNE are the same company and the equipment is proprietary.  There are no known resellers of this product.  Interested parties may e-mail joyce.wright@macdill.af.mil or fax 813-828-5111, Joyce Wright.

Numbered Notes 22  

V.  	DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTORS UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY).
The supplier was chosen because they are the only ones that make the product we need.  DNE Technologies, Inc. is the only manufacturer that meets Engineering Design Models (EDM) stringent requirements and specifications.  This equipment is requested to minimize incompatibility issues.  A search of the internet only showed one other company that produces a similar converter, but its limited to only two communication signals and would require additional space to add extra units to meet the same capabilities as one MCU2.  To purchase the original DNE CV-2048 instead of the UltraDNE with expanded capabilities would not be cost effective as we would have to purchase more converters to receive the expanded capabilities we would receive with the newer UltraDNE converter.  The original DNE CV-2048 costs approximately $5K per converter.  We currently have two of those, but would require 3 more in order to get the capacity the UltraDNE converter holds.  This would be an additional cost of $15,000.00.

<DESC>TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
Disposable Radiation Biodosimeters

                                      

Opportunity: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to license a disposable device for detecting an individual?s exposure to radioactive materials.

Background: Following a terrorist radiological attack, first responders need a portable, disposable device to effectively triage large numbers of victims based on their levels of radiation exposure.  There are currently no such devices in the responders? kits.

Description:  This technology gives emergency personnel the capability to perform quick, inexpensive testing of affected individuals.  LLNL has identified and patented protein and DNA biomarkers to detect ionizing radiation (IR) exposure in humans.  These biomarkers are suitable for use in disposable test kits using lateral flow devices and commercially available antibodies.
Advantages:  
?	Rapid diagnosis ?? perfect for emergency situations ?? reduced feedback time ?? Lower medical costs for the patient
?	Utilizes easily accessible biological samples (skin cells, saliva, blood cells, serum, etc.) ?? May not require FDA approval ?? Lower clinical costs for both patient and health care provider
?	Small, handheld, field-deployable, and easy-to-use ?? Lower operating costs for the care provider	
?	Uses lateral flow technology (similar to home pregnancy tests) ?? Simple, Cost-Effective to build ?? Lower production costs for the manufacturer 
?	Can easily incorporate other protein biomarkers ?? Greater flexibility and adaptability for other applications

Current Applications:   
?	Military or civilian post-attack triage
?	Border control/customs checkpoint sampling
?	Hair, cheek, or blood sample analysis from individuals suspected of handling and/or transporting radiological & nuclear (R/N) materials
?	Forensic sample analysis from suspected R/N weapons labs or incident zones

Potential Applications:  Although the disposable biodosimeter is designed to detect radiation exposure levels, the technology can be used in any situation where protein biomarkers are used, e.g., cancer testing

Intellectual Property:  Portfolio of 6-7 inventions depending on specific application.  U.S. patent applications have been filed for both the markers and the lateral flow technology.

Development Status:  Vendor relationships have been established with a supplier of antibodies and with a device fabricator. To view a picture of the device go to: http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/technology/profile/announcement/disposableradiation.php

LLNL is seeking industry partners with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. All licensing activities are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.

<SUBJECT>A -- SN07- 40, Proposer's Day Conference for Sensor Tape Program
<DESC>PROPOSERS' DAY CONFERENCE
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Strategic Technology Office (STO) will host a Proposers' Day Workshop in support of the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) BAA07-44, Sensor Tape program on June 26th and 27th, 2007 at the Los Angeles Airport Marriott, 5855 West Century Blvd, Los Angeles, California 90045 from 8:30 AM to 5:00 PM.  The purpose of this conference is to provide information on the Sensor Tape program; promote additional discussion on this topic; address questions from potential proposers; and provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.  

DARPA expects to publish a BAA, at a later date, with further details and is scheduling the proposer day in advance as a way of providing potential proposers with notice at the earliest possible time. The technical and programmatic details described in this announcement are accordingly subject to change.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION:  DARPA/STO is soliciting research proposals to develop, test and demonstrate medical monitoring systems for DoD applications and operations. The objective of this program is to develop low-cost medical sensor systems to support DoD missions, in particular to measure the cumulative effects of blast exposure, and to assist in combat medical care, patient triage, and physiologic monitoring in support of physiologic performance. It is anticipated that meeting the goals of this program will require furthering print-on electronics and ink formulation technologies. DARPA is interested in receiving proposals that exploit the novel properties of print-on electronics to develop these medical monitoring systems.   

There are two principle systems of interest: helmet (or body-mounted) blast dosimeters; and basic patient physiological monitoring devices that measure, for example, heart rate, body temperature, pulse, respiration and blood oxygen saturation.  Each system should consist of a patch-like sensor device, and a monitoring unit for communicating with the sensor tape patch.  Other innovative medical devices that incorporate print-on electronics and related enabling technologies may also be proposed.  Proposals may address one or more systems of interest, but must propose a full and complete program for the development, test, field demonstration and, if necessary for the proposed device, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of each system. 

The program will consist of two phases with metrics that must be met to progress to the second phase.  The bidder should develop a program plan that clearly delineates major work efforts and critical milestones in each phase so that a logical technical development path for each proposed system is evident.  Bidders must also outline a path for obtaining FDA approval, if necessary for the devices to be developed, and document their ability to follow Federal guidelines for the protection of human subjects.  DARPA expects that performers will develop the hardware and software necessary for accomplishing these program objectives, with milestone testing to be performed by a government activity in independent government-monitored tests.  The program will culminate in Phase 2 with a field demonstration of the devices developed, scaled and packaged to in-service system size, weight and power.

PHASE 1 
Phase 1 will focus on developing and demonstrating the proposed sensors, and on the communications capability for the patient monitoring device. All-print-on sensors are strongly desired and encouraged, including the patient monitoring device communications capability; however, hybrid solutions that meet the required size, form factor and cost metrics will be considered.  It is anticipated that this will require a focused effort to further the performance of conductive, semi-conductive and resistive inks and associated technologies, as well as improvements in printing resolutions.  At least twenty-five sensors, with the specified communications capability for the patient monitoring device, shall be prepared and delivered to the government for testing.  Required deliverables in Phase 1 include a detailed plan and schedule, with a list of required documentation, to complete an FDA approval process for each device being developed that requires FDA approval; and an analysis of the cost of the proposed sensor tape patches when produced in lots of 100,000.  

PHASE 2 
Phase 2 will focus on the integration of all components (sensors, communications, memory, etc) onto a flexible substrate with adequate shelf life and field durability. A monitoring unit (preferably hand-held for the patient monitoring device) for communicating with the sensor tape patch shall be developed, along with suitable algorithms for data exploitation and display.  The developers shall produce ten monitoring unit prototypes and 1000 sensor tape patches for each system developed.  After obtaining FDA approval (for the devices that require this), the program will conclude with a demonstration of the developed systems in suitable field exercises. 
This solicitation covers technologies in the following areas: print-on electronics, micro-electronic machines, radio frequency radios, wireless networks and protocols, medical triage and patient monitoring, human physiological sensing, acoustic sensing and mensuration, micro power storage.
DARPA requests proposals for the full scope of development (e.g., an end-to-end system designed by a team of multidisciplinary research organizations, plus an integrator for coordination and implementation support).

REGISTRATION INFORMATION:  Participants must register not later than June 22, 2007 at the following website: http://www.schafertmd.com/sensortape/.  Directions to the facility and other materials are also available on the website.  

Due to space limitations of the conference facility, attendance will be limited to the first 200 registrants, and no more than 2 representatives per organization. The Proposers' Day will be unclassified and open to the general public.  All attendees will be required to present government issued photo identification upon entry to the event.  Additionally, all US Citizens are required to submit a US Citizenship Verification form in order to attend this conference.  Non-US citizens are required to submit a DARPA Form 60 "Foreign National Visit Request".  The completed Citizenship Form or DARPA Form 60 must be faxed to:  Tom Fitzgerald, Schafer Corporation 3811 N. Fairfax Drive Arlington VA 22203, fax 703-516-6031, phone 703-516-6061, no later than June 22, 2007.  Both documents are available for download at the registration website.    Attendance is not required to propose to any associated BAA.  

Additionally, on the first day of the conference, 26 June, attendees who would like to present company overviews, discuss their technology expertise, and/or discuss teaming opportunities in scheduled presentations at the conference, may request to do so.  Presentations may contain up to 5 slides. Proposers desiring to reserve a time to present at the Proposers' Day Conference should contact Erik L. Smith at (Fax) 703-516-6060, or email at erik.smith.ctr@darpa.mil, or BAA07-44@darpa.mil, as soon as possible, but no later than June 18 2007.

All material to be displayed at the conference must be approved in advance by both the organization that funded the research and the DARPA Program Manager.  It is the presenter's responsibility to ensure that all material they plan to present at the Proposers' Day Conference has been approved by the funding organization in advance.  The DARPA Program Manager will screen the proposed material for sensitive but unclassified material and approve in advance any presentations.  An electronic copy of all material to be presented must be provided to the DARPA Program Manager (sent via e-mail to: BAA07-44@darpa.mil) for review by June 18, 2007.  There will be no exceptions to this requirement.

On day two of the conference, 27 June, there will be an opportunity to meet individually with DARPA Program Manager, Dr. Jennifer Ricklin.  Please contact Erik L. Smith at erik.smith.ctr@darpa.mil, or BAA07-44@darpa.mil, to schedule an individual session.

<DESC>SOLE SOURCE NOTICE: The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106.  This sole source is intended to be awarded to Aeroflex Witchita Inc.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  A copy of the requested items list will be given upon vendor request. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received by 0800 EDT Wednesday 26 June 07, will be considered by the Government.  A determination not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  A copy of the sole source justification will be provided upon request.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Sole Source is based upon this vendor being the only manufacturer/vendor able to satisfy this requirement: Sole Source is also based upon the authority FAR 6.302-1(2)(C)(ii) which allows for sole source purchase if it is considered a follow-on contract for the continued development of a system when the award would result in duplication of cost.  The circumstances that justify the restrictions to an Aeroflex Test Solutions acquisition are that Aeroflex is the only company that provides the accessory equipment that is compatible with the Army?s GRM-122 test set.  Currently to test different radio systems they must be ?hang tested,? which requires disconnecting a good radio and testing the bad one in its place.  The test system component RPM-002 provides a compliment to the AN/GRM-122 radio test set by allowing digital testing of the entire "Have Quick" radio family consisting of: the ARC-164 RT-1505/A, RT-1167C, RT-1168C, RT-1518/C, RT-1614, ARC-186 RT-1299, RT-1300/A/B/C, and RT-1354.  The test system component RPM-003B provides connectivity for testing of the survivor radios, AN/PRC-112, all models through "G" and also Satcom locator radios.  Although Aviation units are issued the basic version of the AN/GRM-122 Radio Test set, this item comes only with the J-box to allow interface with the Sincgars FM Radios.  In the Aviation Intermediate Maintenance Company there is a requirement to test all radios in the aircraft including the pilot survival radios.

(i.e., ?green card? holders) of the United States are not exempt 
from payment of Federal Income and, in some cases State, income taxes on salaries earned abroad while working for the U.S.

CONTRACTOR-MISSION RELATIONSHIPS 
 
   (a) The contractor acknowledges that this contract is an

be fully commensurate with the responsibilities which this 
entails.  

   (b) While in the Cooperating Country, the contractor is 
expected to show respect for the conventions, customs, and 
institutions of the Cooperating Country and not interfere in its 
political affairs.
 
   (c) If the contractor's conduct is not in accordance with 
paragraph (b) of this provision, the contract may be terminated 
under General Provision 16 of this contract.  The Contractor 
recognizes the right of the U.S. Ambassador to direct his/her 
immediate removal from any country when, in the discretion of 
the Ambassador, the interests of the United States so require.

performing his/her duties in accordance with the statement of 
duties called for by the contract. However, he/she shall be 
under the general policy guidance of the Country Director, and

***You are requested to contact the contract administrator, blake.tubbs@moron.af.mil  should you have any questions regarding this requirement.  It is highly recommended that you register to be notified of any new postings for this combined synopsis/solicitation.  However, the notification of changes that result from registration is only a service and any failure of the service to notify you of changes cannot be used against the Government.  Therefore, you should check FedBizOps frequently for any new postings that may have been made.  As a last resort, if you cannot download a document(s), then our office will send the document(s) to you electronically.  The Government anticipates and reserves the right to issue all solicitation documents in the English language only.

If you do not have one, it is suggested that you contact Dun and Bradstreet at web sites:  http://dnb.com/dunsno/whereduns.htm or http:www.duns.es/.  Failure to have a DUNS number at the time of award may delay the award and depending on the criticality of the project, may be cause to award to the next qualified best value offeror who has a DUNS number.  All contractors are advised that they should be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).  Registration can be made on line at http://www.ccr2000.com/.  NOTE: you must have a DUNS number to register.  Further, contractors are required to have a Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code.  You can obtain a CAGE code by submitting your request via e-mail to: cagemail@dlis.dla.mil; or, fax your request to: 616-961-5305.  However, do not delay submitting your proposal pending receipt of a DUNS number or CAGE code.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format prescribed in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is being requested as a Request for Quote (RFQ); solicitation number is H92244-07-T-0077, as a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) type contract with fixed unit prices.  The anticipated award date is on or about 29 June 2007.  

The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-17, effective 14 June 2007.  North American Industrial Classification Code (NAICS) 541511 applies to this procurement. The DPAS rating for this procurement is DO-C9.  FOB point is Destination.  This procurement is a 100% Small Business Set Aside and solicited for limited competition based on brand name requirements as listed below.

The Command currently utilizes LIDAR and Urban in unison with Feature Analyst Pro in order to enhance extractions, shading, computations, and image infusion.  Additional licenses are necessary in order to accommodate the imagery analysts in support of the warfighters. The brand name products are procured to maintain system continuity for geospatial imaging.  The Feature, LIDAR, and Urban Analyst software are compatible with the Command Security System.  LIDAR, Feature, and Urban Analyst are proprietary software suites.  The incorporation of non-LIDAR, Feature, and Urban software into the ArcGIS toolset will cause system degradation and will void current warranties and support coverage.  This approach would negatively impact the Government in terms of cost and time.

Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format prescribed in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is being requested as a Request for Quote (RFQ); solicitation number is H92244-07-T-0079, as a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) type contract with fixed unit prices.  The anticipated award date is on or about 6 July 2007.

The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-17, effective 14 June 2007.  North American Industrial Classification Code (NAICS) 541511 applies to this procurement. The DPAS rating for this procurement is DO-C9.  FOB point is Destination.  This procurement is 100% Small Business Set Aside and solicited for limited competition based on brand name requirements as listed below.

Orion SOLARWINDS.NET is a proprietary software suite utilized within the Command Computer System.  The brand name products are procured to maintain system continuity.  The incorporation of non-Orion software into the network infrastructure will cause system degradation and will void current warranties and support coverage.  Changing the system configuration would require additional personnel and training to support the new equipment.  This approach would negatively impact the Government in terms of cost and time.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial item prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is HSCG23-07-R-DNQ160.  This solicitation is issued as a request for proposals (RFP) under NAICS code 336612 (size standard, 500 employees) on a full and open basis.  The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) has a need for Special Purpose Craft ? Near-Shore Lifeboat (SPC-NLB) vessels that will be operated in varying sea and weather conditions, along the entire coast of the United States.  The SPC-NLB will be used as a fast response boat and utility boat from a USCG shore station and will frequently have to operate in shallow water (3ft 6in maximum draft) and transit surf (15ft minimum breaking sea) conditions.  The SPC-NLB shall be inherently self righting and self bailing, designed to re-right after a knock down or complete rollover and continue with the assigned mission with no or minimal degradation of operational capability.  The SPC-NLB will be a standard USCG mission multi-mission asset operated with a crew of four.  Typical missions include search and rescue, recreational boating safety, law enforcement, and Port, Waterways, and Coastal Security (including ferry boat escorts).  The vessel will have a forward and aft gun mount to accommodate the M240 machine gun during PWCS missions.  The enclosed cabin shall provide four shock mitigating seats for the crew.  This shore-based asset is not intended for Cutter deployment.  The vessel shall have twin four stroke diesel engines with reversing gears and waterjets.   The specifications for the platform are provided in Amendment 1 to this combined synopsis/solicitation. 

As a result of this solicitation, it is anticipated that a Firm-Fixed Priced Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract with provisions for issuance of delivery orders will be awarded.  The period of performance will be five (5) years from date of award.  It is anticipated that the Government will order a minimum of 1 SPC-NLB with associated support line items and a maximum of four (4) SPC-NLBs with associated support line items.  Offerors shall provide prices for the Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINS) for each of the five years in accordance with the price spreadsheet as provided in Amendment 1 to this combined synopsis/solicitation.

REQUIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE:  The Contractor shall deliver the NLB and associated support CLINs not later than 180 days after receipt of the delivery order for the first boat and 30 days for each subsequent boat ordered thereafter.  An expedited delivery of the first platform is strongly encouraged and shall be considered in evaluation for award.  Should there be a pending order that has not yet been fulfilled; the next consecutive boat ordered shall be delivered within 30 days after the last boat on the previous order.  The delivery locations will be identified in each applicable Delivery Order.  The anticipated delivery locations are the Pacific Northwest and the Northeast.  It is the responsibility of the contractor to deliver the boat, with the ability to place the NLB on the cradle and/or in the water upon delivery, at the respective delivery locations.  Whether the NLB will be required to be placed on the cradle or in the water upon delivery will be identified in each applicable Delivery Order.  All associated support CLINS that are ordered concurrent with the boat are to be delivered at the same time as the boat, unless otherwise identified in the applicable order.  All Provisioning Technical Documentation shall be delivered to the Contracting Officer or the COTR.  The exact addresses will be identified in the applicable Delivery Order.

The U.S. Coast Guard inspection and pre-acceptance trials will be conducted at the Contractor?s facility, prior to shipment of each NLB.  The inspection and pre-acceptance efforts are expected to take 2-3 days.  Final acceptance of the NLB and all support CLIN items shall be at the designated delivery location as stated in the applicable Delivery Order.  The first platform will be delivered to Ilwaco, WA for extended testing and evaluating of the platform and its self-righting ability.  

AUTHORIZED INDIVIDUALS TO PLACE ORDERS:  Only a Contracting Officer residing in G-ACS, USCG Headquarters, Washington, DC may place orders under this IDIQ contract.  The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation: (1) FAR 52.252-1 Solicitation Provisions Incorporated by Reference (FEB 1998).  This solicitation incorporates one or more solicitation provisions by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text.  Upon request, the Contracting Officer will make their full text available.  The offeror is cautioned that the listed provisions may include blocks that must be completed by the offeror and submitted with its offer.  In lieu of submitting the full text of those provisions, the offeror may identify the provision by paragraph identifier and provide the appropriate information with its offer.  Also, the full text of a solicitation provision may be accessed electronically at this/these address(es): http://www.arnet.gov. (2) FAR 52.252-2 Clauses Incorporated by Reference (FEB 1998).  (3) FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (JAN 2006).  (4) FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (JAN 1999) (a) The Government will award the contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government offering the best value, price and other factors considered.   The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes: (1) Vessel Operational Capability and Physical Characteristics; Proposals will be evaluated on their demonstrated ability to produce and deliver a boat that enables the USCG to effectively perform mission critical operations and that performs at a consistently high level. The proposed configuration of the vessel will be evaluated for ease of use and maintainability. Human engineering will also be evaluated to ensure that the boat is laid out in a manner that enables the crew to move freely, so as not to inhibit them from performing mission critical operations effectively. The ability to conduct search and rescue operations (particularly search execution, PIW recovery, and towing astern in surf/heavy weather), alongside towing, law enforcement/defense operations, and mission readiness are to be evaluated as these are  the primary functions of the boats.  The proposed boat design maturity, ability to maintain the level of performance as set forth in the requirements, maintenance with minimal down time in the field will also be evaluated. Greater importance will be given to proposals that meet stated Objective levels of performance in the specification.  (2) Production Capability; Proposals will be evaluated on their demonstrated capability to produce and deliver boats at the rate and quantity stated herein, with emphasis on an accelerated delivery of the first boat.  The evaluation will focus on the Offeror?s facilities, equipment, and experience.  (3) Quality Assurance and Management; Proposals will be evaluated on their demonstrated ability to provide an overall management structure to ensure quality boats are produced, tested, delivered and supported in a timely manner, and in accordance with the Specification.  Great importance will be given to the offeror's demonstrated ability to ensure consistency in quality; ensure the configuration management of the boat; adequate management control of the standardization program and subcontractors; and evidence of their quality assurance capabilities.  (4) Warranty Terms and Warranty Plan; Proposals will be evaluated on their demonstrated ability to provide efficient and effective warranty support to the USCG/CBP after the boats are in use in the field, to include the time required to affect repairs after receipt of notification from the Government; (5)  Relevant Past Performance; Past performance will be evaluated in terms of Quality; Timeliness of Performance; Business Relations; and Customer Satisfaction. If no relevant past performance information is available, offerors will be given a neutral rating.  Provide 3 recent past performance references of similar contracts currently in place, delivery orders, purchase orders, or a combination of all done within the past 3 years.  Similar contracts listed may include any contract entered into with the Federal Government, agencies of state and local governments, and commercial customers.  Include the following information: (a) Name of Contract Activity; (b) Contract Number, (c) Contract Type; (d) Total Contract Value; (e) Description of Item(s), (f) Contracting Officer Name, Telephone Number and e-mail address; (g) Program Manager Name and Telephone Number (if applicable); (h) Contracting Officer?s Technical Representative Name and Telephone Number; and (i) Administrative Contracting Officer?s Technical Representative, if different from (f), and e-mail address.   (6) Price.   Prices will be evaluated for price reasonableness as follows:  The Boat CLIN will be evaluated separately and then all other CLINS will be evaluated collectively.  Offerors proposed price should include a calculated subtotal for each year and a calculated total overall price.  Pricing should also include any discounts offered for quantity orders or alternate payment arrangements (i.e. 3rd party purchase).  The total evaluated price will be the sum of all CLINs for the entire potential ordering period of the IDIQ contract (five years).  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the prices are significantly unbalanced.  Although the ceiling for the IDIQ contract will be for four (4), pricing of one (1) boat each is required for each of the five (5) years of the contract for evaluation purposes.  The Government will evaluate the offeror?s price for award purposes of each year within the period of performance within the resultant contract.  The table shows only one (1) boat per year, however, the Government may order more or fewer boats in any particular year, up to the ceiling of four (4) boats over the five (5) year ordering period.

In addition to what?s required by FAR 52.212-1, the offeror shall provide information to support the areas of consideration in each applicable evaluation factor that will be evaluated for award as stated above.

The Government will award the contract to the offeror who has the best overall value on the basis of its offer and its capability to perform the work.  The evaluation factors are listed in descending order of important, with the first evaluation factor being significantly important than all other non-price related factors.  When all evaluation factors are combined, non-price factors are more important than price, ?end of provision?.  Offerors shall include a completed copy of the provision FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (JUN 2006), with their offer.  FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions?Commercial Items (SEP 2005), is incorporated by reference into the solicitation.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS: It is the policy of the USCG to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. This agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protestor fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the following address: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 Second Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, DC  20593, and Phone: (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held- 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation is a request for quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-16 and DFARs Change Notice (DCN) 20070531. This acquisition is a small business set-aside.  This is a Brand Name or equal acquisition for the item listed below ?V please submit sufficient literature detailing product specifications. NAICS is 334220 with a small business size standard of 750 employees.  Solicitation is for commercial purchase of Enerdyne Encoder Equipment or equal as listed below.  

Description:  The Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), Edwards AFB, CA has a requirement for 2 each SA 309913-01, ENC1000A94-00 Encoders (with Standard Features) to support the 419 FLTS to conduct flight testing.  This equipment must be completely compatible with the Enerdyne units that are already installed and in use in the bombers and other flight test aircraft at AFFTC.  The following are the specifications:

?XADVS- Adaptive Digital Video Standard Compression Algorithm
?XReal-Time Digital Compression of Full-Motion Video
?XSmall Size ?V 94 Cubic Inches
?XLow Power ?V 8 Watts Typical at 28 VDC
?XThree Selectable Video Inputs

?XUser Programmable Video Parameters via EIA-232 Port
?XCompsite NTSC Color and PAL, Y/C Capabilities
?XTransmits at Rates Up to 10 Mbps Over Any Digital Medium

The ADVS Advanced Digital Video Standard compression technique causes no blurring of the compressed picture upon the encoding and decoding of any type of moving objects within a given picture.  A multiplexer provides inputs for asynchronous serial data, PCM data and clock, and an audio signal to be interspersed into the digitized video data stream.

The encoders will be used to compress the video signal received from the Merlin units in order to be able to record two hours using a HI-8mm tri-deck airborne video recorder.  Also, this signal may be transmitted to a ground station where the telemetry system will provide a real-time video picture of the pilot??s Head-Up-Display (HUD), the Multi-Function Display (MFD) and/or safety of flight test data during a mission.  Flight test engineers will be able to monitor aircraft performance in the control room as they observe an image of the pilot??s HUD and/or MFD.

The following numbered notes are applicable:  1. 
Questions and Answers
06/11/2007

Question 1.  It appears the FFP line items we are being requested to quote are for 20, 120 and 80 flight days respectively, but the Q&A indicates that the government intention is to task this in smaller chunks.  Further examination of FAR 52.212 and the provided fill-ins indicates that the maximum order at any one time is for 20 flight days.  With this in mind, is the government requesting that vendors actually provide FFP quote figures on a "per flight day" basis?  Or is the idea that vendors submit pricing for the flight day quantities above, and you will then divide by the total to get a per day figure?  Since there is no SF 1449 with required blanks to fill in, we just want to ensure that our pricing submittal is compliant.  It occurs to us that a per flight day figure for each location may be more appropriate, since we also may be able to apply a volume discount scheme as allowed by the FAR.

ANSWER 1:  The estimates are for a period of performance of one year:  July 01, 2007 through June 30, 2008.  The line items should have stated, ?Unit Price per Flight Day $       ?.

Question 2.  Can you clarify the following language?  "The contractor remains legally responsible for each pilot provided under this contract and will supervise each pilot as defined at 5 USC 7103(a)(10)." The U.S. Code supervisory requirements are clear and certainly part of our business practices, but is there an intent to burden the contractor with some kind of liability requirements with this statement?  Does the government expect the contractor to carry aviation liability insurance for the operation of non-owned aircraft?  

ANSWER 2:  In accordance with FAR (Federal Acquisition Regulation) 37.104, the intent of this language is to make clear that the requirement is not a personal services contract.  It is the contractor?s choice to carry aviation liability insurance for the operation of non-owned aircraft. 

Question 3.  We have so far been unable to locate an electronic version of form USM-271.  Can this be made available or do you have a link where it may be downloaded?

ANSWER 3:  A form USM-271 wiil be e-mailed to anyone requesting the form.  Please send e-mail request to sandra.fink@usdoj.gov

<DESC>Q1-      On pages 1 of 5 and 2 of 5 you have sections (Portable brake
dynamometer technology can: and Capabilities:) which are started with ? marks.
      Is this a typo, or is there significance?

A 1-   FedBizOpps does not recognize hyphens or bullets.  It inserts question marks and these do not pertain to the verbiage.
 
Q2-     Under Minimum bid requirements: page 2 of 5, the first two
paragraphs talk about PBBT usage on mine roads or parking area (irregular dirt or gravel surface). It also mentions the vendor providing cribbing and wedges for uneven surfaces.
     We've investigated cribbing and wedges, and you're talking about large trusses. A PBBT should be on a level surface (side-to-side, front to back? Trying to set a PBBT in the middle of a dirt road with a 20% incline, and using wedges for leveling would create significant safety issues and testing would be compromised due to actual weight load distribution on the vehicle.

A 2-    "Surface ruts and holes may be present requiring the PBBT to be blocked to provide support for the frame.  The frame must be able to span limited ruts."  "Cribbing and wedges must be supplied for uneven surfaces."  As further explanation of these requirements, MSHA expects that the set up site will have a smooth, level surface.  However, the conditions at mining operations does not preclude that either the downgrade and/or side slope may range from 0% - 3% and that ruts up to 6" deep by up to 18" long may be present.  Any cribbing needed to support the PBBT for testing under these conditions must be provided.
 

Q3-      On page 3 of 5, paragraph two, sentence two, says " A minimum 2?
Amber flashing strobe light on a 6? Stand with it's own base.
     What should the ? be? How are these lights used?

A3-  See answer to question one (1).

Q4-     Near the bottom of page 3 of 5, the specification states, "The
PBBT must pass an acceptance performance test upon completion of training of the MSHA personnel." 
     What is the acceptance performance test specification? 

A 4-    "The PBBT must pass an acceptance performance test upon completion of the training of MSHA personnel."  As further explanation of this requirement, the acceptance criteria are that, upon completion of training, MSHA personnel are able to setup/tear Down the PBBT, as supplied, on simulated mining site conditions without undue difficulty (reference FMCSA's Functional Specifications, http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules-regulations/administration/rulemakings/080900n.pdf, Setup/Tear Down Time, except a time of 1 hour is acceptable if cribbing is required), successfully operate all features of the PBBT, obtain accurate brake performance data, and quickly analyze a vehicle's brake system, i.e. reference FMCSA's Functional Specifications Inspection Time requirements.

Q5-     On page 4 of 5, the third paragraph states, "The trailer must
totally enclose the brake dynamometer and associated equipment". 
While we believe you should consider a totally enclosed transport trailer, this statement conflicts with information from paragraph eight on page 3 of 5, regarding a fitted tarp. Can you please clarify?

A 5-   "The trailer must totally enclose the brake dynamometer and associated equipment."  As further explanation of this requirement and the requirement that "Protection for the PBBT from weather must be provided during transport, i.e. specially fitted tarp." note that these are alternate requirements.  At a minimum, the bid must include the cost of a weather-proof covering for the PBBT.  The bidder may also specify a totally enclosed trailer and the additional cost for this alternate feature.
 

Q6-     On page 2 of 5, under Capabilities: you state "Be capable of
performing brake checks of on-highway truck including significantly overloaded on-highway  trucks.
            What type of trucks are you really testing? On-Highway trucks are defined in the FMSCA standard and they fit on our standard roller width. What is the 
 "significantly overloaded" weight maximum? Does that equate to the 60,000 lbs axle weight?
 
A 6 -"Be capable of performing brake checks of on-highway trucks including significantly overloaded on-highway trucks."  As further explanation of this requirement, the PBBT must at a minimum meet the FMCSA's Functional Specifications and be able to test trucks with a maximum axle weight of 40,000 lb and a maximum total vehicle weight of 100,000 lb.  MSHA expects to only test truck's designed for on-highway use, i.e. typical wheel base dimensions.  Some on-highway trucks loaded in excess of 100,000 lbs. and some originally designed on-highway trucks fitted with over-sized beds, also loaded in excess of 100,000 lbs, may be encountered.  To accommodate these trucks, the bidder may specify an alternate PBBT designed for a maximum axle rating of 60,000 lbs and a maximum total vehicle weight of 150,000 lbs.  The bidder must specify the additional cost for this alternate design.





Q 7. Will a forklift be available to offload and load the tester from a trailer or should it be fixed to the trailer? If the tester must be fixed to the trailer then the ramps will be much longer.

A 7. 1Response:  A forklift will not be available to unload the tester.  The tester must be able to be unloaded manually but the tester is not required to be fixed to the trailer.


Q 8. This proposal is designed to be off-loaded from a trailer or truck quickly and easily, is there a flatbed truck or trailer available at the site so that expense can be avoided?

A 8.  No, the trailer must be supplied as part of the PBBT. 


Q 9. This proposal includes an enclosed booth for the test personnel and all electronic devices I.E. computer, printer, etc?.   Is air conditioning of the booth something you would like us to quote? 

A 9.  No-air conditioning is not requested.


Q 10. You refer to a UL standard for wet locations, could you provide the specification or the number.  

A 10.Refer to UL-50 for the general requirements.  This standard specifies other standards for individual components.  Also see:  http://www.ul.com/regulators/ode/0803.pdf .  The intent is to provide for the safe use and durability of electrical components in very wet conditions.  Other proposed standards/designs will be reviewed.

Q 11. Can the ground clearance for the vehicles to be tested be provided?

A 11.  Typical on-highway trucks/trailers will be tested.  A maximum PBBT test height of 6" would be acceptable.  Other proposed heights will be reviewed for acceptability.

Q 12. Could you describe how the testing unit will be use, as far as number of locations and how permanent the locations are?

A 12.  The PBBT will likely be moved every 1 - 3 days to different mining operations.  New setup locations will be established at each mine site.

Q 13. It could make sense to build a concrete structure so that the trailer can pull up to the site and test the trucks without ramps. The structure would be simple and make testing easier faster setup and lower the equipment cost.

A 13.  The short testing time at each site makes building a concrete structure impractical.

Q 14. Could you give more detail concerning the optional axle lift? Capacity? Configuration?

A 14.  The axle lifting jack will be used to raise the vehicle to allow visual inspection of the truck's brake components.  The design of the lift must accommodate typical on-highway trucks.  The lifting jack must meet recognized safety standards, i.e. ANSI, and have a positive locking mechanism or backup jack stand to prevent the truck from falling in the event the lifting jack fails.  The lifting jack's (and locking mechanism or jack stand) design should accommodate a maximum individual axle weight of 60,000 lbs.  The lifting jack may be part of the PBBT or a separate component.  

Q 15. Would wireless controls be of interest? Will the test operator be driving the truck also?

A 15.  Wireless controls would be of interest.  The test operator will not be driving the truck.

 Q 16. In the optional requirements is it asking for 34 inches inside of the tires along the axle? The next requirement asks for testing 12 inch diameter tires to be tested? If this is true, what is the maximum axle width (outside of both tires) and largest outside diameter tire dimension of a vehicle being tested?

A 16.  Yes.  The PBBT must be able to primarily test on-highway trucks.  As an option, the PBBT must also be able to accommodate a dimension between the tires along the axle of 34".   Also as an option, the PBBT may be designed to accommodate an outside tire dimension of 12'.  The 13' was a typo.  The inside and outside dimensions are intended to primarily allow more room for the truck driver to pull onto the PBBT.  Vehicles with typical on-highway truck tires will be tested, i.e. 11R22.5- typical loaded radius 19.5", but larger on-highway tires may also be tested.  Other proposed design configurations will be reviewed. 


Q 17.Description section: Quickly provide performance results....
How quickly do you want the machine to test, some brake testers are running at 0.5 km/hr and others at 4 km/hr. The testing speed depends on the size of the motors and gear box, the smaller means the slower, can you be more specific since the price of the 2 motors in the equipment can definitely impact on the total purchase price.

A 17. The PBBT must meet the requirements of  ?Functional Specifications as called out in the Notice of Final Determination, Guidelines of Development of Functional Specifications for Performance-Based Brake Tester Used to Inspect Commercial Motor Vehicles (65 FR 48799).?  see:  http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules-regulations/administration/rulemakings/080900n.pdf.  We have no other specifications related to speed.  We request manufacturers state the test speed of the PBBT and the benefits of this speed in the testing. 


Q 18.  Minimum bid requirements section: The PBBT must be blocked to provide support for the frame Can you specify which device should be used (what do you have in mind) to block the PBBT.

A 18.  ?Surface ruts and holes may be present requiring the PBBT to be blocked to provide support for the frame.  The frame must be able to span limited ruts.?  ?Cribbing and wedges must be supplied for uneven surfaces.?  As further explanation of these requirements, MSHA expects that the set up site will have a smooth, level surface.  However, the conditions at mining operations does not preclude that either the downgrade and/or side slope may range from 0% - 3% and that ruts up to 6" deep by up to 18" long may be present.  Any cribbing needed to support the PBBT for testing under these conditions must be provided.


Q 19. Minimum bid requirements section: Ramps will be positioned to drive     up onto the frame...    it is important to have ramps before and AFTER the PBBT to keep the vehicle leveled at all time while testing, do you plan to have ramps before AND after the PBBT.

A 19. Yes, as part of the bid, ramps before and after the PBBT must be provided.

Q 20. Minimum bid requirements section: Cribbing and wedges must be supplied...  Do you have size and quantity?

A. 20.  Refer to the response to question (2).

Q 21.  Minimum bid requirements section:  The PBBT must meet the FMCSA        Functional Specifications...   As far as I know, no portable brake tester meets the FMCSA Functional Specifications, how can you ask for something which is currently not existing?

A 21.  MSHA will consider bids for portable PBBT?s that do not meet the FMCSA  specifications.  Bidders must specify which of  the FMSCA?s requirements are not met.  

Q 22. Minimum bid requirements section:  The PBBT shall be UL approved for wet locations.  Could you please give a standard to refer to?

A 22. Refer to UL-50 for the general requirements.  This standard specifies other standards for individual components.  Also see:  http://www.ul.com/regulators/ode/0803.pdf .  The intent is to provide for the safe use and durability of electrical components in very wet conditions.  Other proposed standards/designs will be reviewed.

Q 23. Minimum bid requirements section:   US DOT specifications can be provided on request.    Please send me the specifications for the trailer.

A 23.Please see:  http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/staticfiles/DOT/NHTSA/Rulemaking/Articles/Associated%20Files/trailer002.pdf  .  Also, the requirements for the PBBT are described in ?Functional Specifications as called out in the Notice of Final Determination, Guidelines of Development of Functional Specifications for Performance-Based Brake Tester Used to Inspect Commercial Motor Vehicles (65 FR 48799).?  see:  http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules-regulations/administration/rulemakings/080900n.pdf  sections 3.2.2, 3.2.2.1, and 3.2.2.2.  See DOT regulations at:  49CFR 393, http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules-regulations/administration/fmcsr/fmcsrguidedetails.asp?regulation=393 , and 49CFR571 at:  http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules-regulations/administration/fmcsr/fmcsrguidedetails.asp?regulation=571 .


Q 24. Additional optional specification section:  The PBBT must be designed to simulate road vibration to check suspension components.  It seems as if you are describing/referring to two different options shaker plates (also referred to as play detector) and suspension tester. Please specify which of the 2 equipment you want or movement you desire. Suspension tester will give up and down movement and play detector wil give left-right and/or front/back movement.

A 24.  Correction to specification- The intent is to check for steering component defects (excessive play).  A suspension tester is not requested.

Q 25. Additional optional specification section:  The PBBT must be equipped with a lifting jack to allow.... What weight must the lifting jack be able to support?

A 25.  The axle lifting jack will be used to raise the vehicle to allow visual inspection of the truck's brake components.  The design of the lift must accommodate typical on-highway trucks.  The lifting jack must meet recognized safety standards, i.e. ANSI, and have a positive locking mechanism or backup jack stand to prevent the truck from falling in the event the lifting jack fails.  The lifting jack's (and locking mechanism or jack stand) design should accommodate a maximum individual axle weight of 60,000 lbs.  The lifting jack may be part of the PBBT or a separate component.  

Q 26.  Additional optional specification section: In this section you are proving minimum individual axle weight, brake stopping force per wheel, inside dimension of tires and maximum outside dimension of tires, should these values be used also for the minimum bid requirements section?

A 26.  These valves should not be used for the minimum bid specification.  For the minimum bid specification, the PBBT should meet the FMCSA?s specifications.  These optional specifications are intended to allow MSHA to more easily test vehicles and test a wider range of vehicles.

<DESC>Bid response time is extended to June 13, 2007 at 4:00 p.m. CST.  A revised Statement of Work has been posted on the DOC homepage http://sill-www.army.mil/doc/  Change marks to the SOW are in the left hand margin.  Contractors must acknowledge this m odification when submitting a bid response.Questions & Answers (Set II)Question 1)My company is primarily a project management firm.  Therefore, we are exempt from the worker's comp and the auto liability policy requirements.  However, it is our standard p ractice to have our subcontractors includes us as additional insured on their policies, and they, of course, have all the insurance needs for this project. Is this procedure acceptable for your group as it has been for so many other of our Government clien ts? Answer: As identified in section (T) of the combined synopsis solicitation.  Section (T) states that the Contractor and any subcontractors shall procure and maintain during the entire period of performance under this contract the following minimum insu rance coverage:  to include Workers Compensation and Employers Liability Insurance and shall extend to cover employers liability for accidental bodily insurance or death and for occupational disease with a minimum liability limit of $100,000.Question 2) If our company is selected for this project, we would like to do a complete inventory of available product in St Louis and draw up a set of typicals for approval by your customer.  For example, we would show how each and every 6x6 station would be built, a nd we would convert the customer's desire for 6x8's shown on the drawing into 6x9's due to availability of product.  There simply isn't an adequate amount of 24 inch panels to do 6x8's but there are plenty of 36 inch panels for the 6x9 configurations.Is th is process acceptable?   Answer: The Government expects 8x10 and10x10 configurations for 3rd & 4th floors and 7x10 and 6x8 on the 1st floor.Question 3)Contractor has requested information about building 4700 and where excess furniture will be received: a)  Location?  Answer: Building 2192, Fort Sill, OK 73503.b)  Accessibility?  Answer: Single story building with loading dock.Question 4)There are count discrepancies, i.e. binder bins and overall workstations.  The count taken by a contractor representative at the site visit on 6 June 2007 revealed approximately 400 work stations were at the DFAS location.  However, Technical Exhibit 1 states 250 workstations will be moved.  The Fort Sill drawings show approximately 179 workstations.  Further, Technical Exhib it 1 states that there are 7708 binder bins and based on this number there would be 30 binder bins to each workstation if there are a total of 250 workstations.  Answer: 255 workstations and 7708 binder bins will be moved in accordance with Technical Exhib it 1.  There will be excess furniture items and all items are identified in Technical Exhibit 1.Question 5)There is incomplete information on the drawings, i.e. panel heights and widths doors etc.  Our company proposes the following value add to insure tha t your end user expectations are met; conduct an inventory of the product components at the origin site and develop CAD drawings for the build out based on an understanding of the end user requirements.  Answer: It is at the Contractors discretion to cond uct an inventory of the product components at the origin site and develop CAD drawings.Question 6)With the addition of amendment #2 I propose/seek that we start the electrical and cabling work at building 4700 on 18 June 2007.  The original scope of work t o begin on 25 June 2007.  Do you think that this maybe possible?  Answer: Yes, work may begin as early as date of award.  This work will include electrical only.  Communications cabling is not included in this requirement.Question 7)To clarify, we are prop osing 3 circuits for each 6 stations with some additional single double and triple stations for a total of 60 hookups and 180 circuits. Answer: Yes, thisis acceptable for the electrical connection only.Question 8)   I need a clarification to the type of cabling.  We will be proposing a CAT5E non-plenum cable 255 triple pulls from a centrally located communications room for each floor; for the maximum linear f t to be no more than 300 per pull.  Each cable will test and be certified from jack at station and terminated at contractor supplied patch panel.Answer: This requirement does not include communications cabling. The Contractor shall provide poles and 1 cubi cle pigtail per 6 workstations.

For example, we would show how each and every 6x6 station would be built, and we would convert the customer's desire for 6x8's shown on the drawing into 6x9's due to availability of product.  There simply isn't an adequate amount of 24 inch panels to do 6x8's but there are plenty of 36 inch panels for the 6x9 configura tions.Is this process acceptable?   Answer: The Government expects 8x10 and10x10 configurations for 3rd & 4th floors and 7x10 and 6x8 on the 1st floor. Question 3)Contractor has requested information about building 4700 and where excess furniture will be received: a)  Location?  Answer: Building 2192, Fort Sill, OK 73503.b)  Accessibility?  Answer: Single story building with loading dock. Question 4)There are count discrepancies, i.e. binder bins and overall workstations.  The count taken by a contractor representative at the site visit on 6 June 2007 revealed approximately 400 work stations were at the DFAS location.  However, Technical Ex hibit 1 states 250 workstations will be moved.  The Fort Sill drawings show approximately 179 workstations.  Further, Technical Exhibit 1 states that there are 7708 binder bins and based on this number there would be 30 binder bins to each workstation if t here are a total of 250 workstations.  Answer: 255 workstations and 7708 binder bins will be moved in accordance with Technical Exhibit 1.  There will be excess furniture items and all items are identified in Technical Exhibit 1.Question 5)There is incompl ete information on the drawings, i.e. panel heights and widths doors etc.  Our company proposes the following value add to insure that your end user expectations are met; conduct an inventory of the product components at the origin site and develop CAD dra wings for the build out based on an understanding of the end user requirements.  Answer: It is at the Contractors discretion to conduct an inventory of the product components at the origin site and develop CAD drawings.Question 6)With the addition of amen dment #2 I propose/seek that we start the electrical and cabling work at building 4700 on 18 June 2007.  The original scope of work to begin on 25 June 2007.  Do you think that this maybe possible?  Answer: Yes, work may begin as early as date of award.  T his work will include electrical only.  Communications cabling is not included in this requirement.Question 7)To clarify, we are proposing 3 circuits for each 6 stations with some additional single double and triple stations for a total of 60 hookups and 1 80 circuits. Answer: Yes, this  is acc eptable for the electrical connection only.Question 8)   I need a clarification to the type of cabling.  We will be proposing a CAT5E non-plenum cable 255 triple pulls from a centrally located communications room for each floor; for the maximum linear ft t o be no more than 300 per pull.  Each cable will test and be certified from jack at station and terminated at contractor supplied patch panel.Answer: This requirement does not include communications cabling. The Contractor shall provide poles and 1 cubicle  pigtail per 6 workstations.
