<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">1. GENERAL INTENT: </span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The purpose of this Notice is to announce the U.S. Government's intent to seek competition for an eighth Manufacturing Innovation Institute (MII) to be led by the Department of Defense (DoD). <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The topic of this eighth DoD-led Institute is<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"> Robots in Manufacturing Environments (RIME)</strong>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"> </strong>motivation for the RIME-MII is to improve U.S. competitiveness in manufacturing through advancements in the smart collaborative robotic field.</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: "> This technology has the potential to level the manufacturing playing field with competing low labor cost economies, with decreased manufacturing cost, better quality and timely reaction to changes needed by the customer. Smart, collaborative robotics can also enable "batch of one" production, also known as mass customization. The technologies developed in this institute will be primarily focused in making advanced manufacturing more competitive, addressing DoD needs, and contribute to improving prosperity in the United States. The Institute will focus on technology areas such as human robot interaction, adaption, learning, manipulation, autonomy, mobility and perception.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">These state of the art technology areas cut across defense, space, automotive and general commercial sectors. In the manufacturing sector, advanced robots could operate directly alongside humans to enable better quality and efficiency in processes with less variation in the resultant product. Ancillary to the manufacturing application space, the same technologies can be applied to robots for commercial and defense markets such as robots in medical procedures, aerospace manufacturing, space exploration, material handling, mining and earthmoving, and consumer markets such as home service robots and patient recuperation, especially important for an aging population.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">2. BACKGROUND: <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Of the eight overall Institutes currently established as part of the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI) program, six are led by DoD and two are led by the Department of Energy (DOE). The DoD is leading MIIs focused on the following technology areas: (1) Additive Manufacturing; (2) Lightweight and Modern Metals; (3) Digital Manufacturing and Design; (4) Integrated Photonics; (5) Flexible Hybrid Electronics, (6) Revolutionary Fibers and Textiles. Another DoD institute for Advanced Tissue Biofabrication is under solicitation (W911NF-16-R-0021). The DOE is similarly leading MIIs within the NNMI program, with the first two focused on (1) Power Electronics; and (2) Advanced Composites.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Additionally, DOE will soon announce the award of a third Institute entitled Smart Manufacturing:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Advanced Sensors, Controls, Platforms and Modeling for Manufacturing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>DOE's fourth Institute, Modular Chemical Process Intensification, is currently under solicitation. DOE recently announced their fifth institute topic, Reducing EMbodied-energy And Decreasing <span style="text-decoration: underline;">E</span>missions (REMADE) in Materials Manufacturing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), within the Department of Commerce (DOC) is currently running an open-topic competition for one or more MIIs. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Each planned or existing MII brings together industry, universities and community colleges, federal agencies, and state organizations to accelerate innovation by investing in industrially-relevant manufacturing technologies with broad applications. MIIs are intended to bridge the gap between research and product development, provide shared assets allowing access to cutting-edge capabilities and equipment, and create an unparalleled environment to educate and train students and workers in advanced manufacturing skills. Each Institute serves as a regional hub of manufacturing excellence with a national impact.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>MIIs provide the necessary innovation infrastructure to repair fragmented advanced manufacturing ecosystems, enabling the U.S. manufacturing sector to commercialize products.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Over the last few decades, there have been numerous advancements in the use of robots in manufacturing, mainly in the automotive and electronics sectors. However, the manufacturing use of robotics has traditionally been restricted to one repetitive task and physically separated from human workers. Technological advancements in robotic research areas such as machine perception/sensing, autonomy, dexterous manipulation, collaborative behaviors with humans, platform mobility, and machine learning allow increased flexibility and collaboration between humans and robots. The RIME-MII will focus on applied research, technology demonstration, technology transition and scale up (MRL 4-7). It will facilitate connections between the US robotics research and development community and the domestic industrial base to enable agile, cost effective production of diverse consumer tailored products, thus strengthening U.S. competitiveness. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">3. THIS INSTITUTE:</span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: "> The technical focus area for this Institute is: <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Robots in Manufacturing Environments Manufacturing Innovation Institute (RIME-MII)</strong>. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The RIME-MII will bring together manufacturing, engineering, computer science, and research organizations from universities, government and industry, local, state, and federal government agencies to address common manufacturing challenges. This collaboration will enable delivery of intelligent, responsive robotic technologies which can be applied to multiple disciplines and requirements, with a primary focus on agile manufacturing.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The cost of labor drives low skilled manufacturing jobs to low-wage nations around the world. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The insertion of agile, collaborative robotics into U.S. manufacturing has the potential to alter the current paradigm by changing the cost, quality and efficiency equations. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The vision of the institute includes robots working collaboratively with humans on the assembly line and in material handling; increasing productivity and precision while freeing humans from low-value added activities. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The integration of advanced robotics into multiple manufacturing areas will<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold"> enhance U.S. competitiveness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The evolution of smart, collaborative robots in the private sector is hampered by the fragmented nature of the current robotic technology base, proprietary intellectual property, and a lack of resources for applied research and development.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Different attributes of the desired robotic capabilities are under development in the private sector, but there is limited coordination to bring these attributes together and a lack of common standards.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The RIME-MII will create a common collaborative environment to advance and synergize emerging technologies to accelerate the development of agile, collaborative robots for manufacturing as well as bring the different disciplines together. The RIME-MII will provide the facilities and institutional knowledge for prototype integration and development, testing, evaluation, validation, and verification of robotic technologies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The RIME-MII will also synthesize industry concepts and practices to develop standards and support a robotic technology repository, compressing learning curves for robotic manufacturers and users.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">In order to achieve disruptive change in U.S. manufacturing, advanced manufacturing robotic systems need to be intelligent, perceptive, mobile, adaptable, and have the capability to work side-by-side with humans with minimal restrictions. Specific technology enablers include: (1) collaborative robotics which includes advanced human-machine interfaces to ensure seamless, safe, and intuitive interactions; (2) intelligence and learning to effectively and efficiently repurpose to quickly adapt to multiple levels of tasking; (3) dexterous manipulation for robust and efficient object acquisition and grasping; (4) autonomous platform mobility in a highly contested manufacturing environment; (5) machine perception in order to operate and monitor surroundings for safety and productivity;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>and, (6) testing/verification/validation to ensure assurance, efficiency, and safety.</span></p>
