<DESC>The Department of Commerce/National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration is conducting a combined acquisition with step 1 being a market survey and step 2 being a design analysis.  The design study will be for a new SWATH vessel to improve hydrographic and ocean mapping in the Eastern United States.  This coastal mapping vessel will be based in New Hampshire and be a versatile platform enabling multi-mission capability with cutting edge research and development in hydrographic and ocean mapping techniques and technologies.  The primary ship mission is full seafloor mapping in coastal areas.  Operations will be conducted continuously 24 hours a day with an endurance of 10 days during all seasons of the year on the Eastern Seaboard.  The SWATH ship will replace the RUDE.  Anticipated homeport is Portsmouth, New Hampshire.  Standards and Design Guidance will include, but are not limited to, SOLAS, MARPOL, ABS, 46 CFR Subchapter U, and IEEE 45.  It is anticipated that this acquisition will be released on or about Monday, April 1, 2002.
