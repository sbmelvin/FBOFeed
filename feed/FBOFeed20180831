<DESC>PREFACE:
The FAA intends to extend the current Contract Weather Observation contracts. This action will result in the extension of the 17 Contract Weather Observation contracts through September 30, 2019. The basis of the single source is for continuity of services and compliance with Public Law 115-141.
Title: Award of Contract Weather Observation Contract Extensions 
The seven contracts identified below will be extended for 10 months and two weeks. 
DTFAWA-13-C-00055, Vero Technical Support

DTFAWA-14-C-00013, Alaska Weather Operations Services
The services on all seventeen contracts, after the extension identified above, will end on September 30, 2019.
PROCUREMENT ACTION:
This action is for a single source justification to extend the 17 Contract Weather Observation contracts through September 30, 2019.
In accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System (AMS) T3.2.2.4, the purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of FAAâs decision to extend temporarily the current seventeen Contract Weather Observation contracts. The extensions will provide continuity of critical weather observation services and prevent any lapse in service. 
The contracts now are staggered into two periods of performance with different end dates and this extension would bring the performance period and end dates for those contracts into alignment and obviate the need for two competitions for this one service.  The existing Contractors of the seventeen CWO contracts are the proposed single source awardees for the extended period. The time remaining on the contracts is not sufficient time to conduct a new competition before the current contracts expire. 
However, procurement planning for the next competition is underway. The follow-on contract is scheduled for an October 1, 2019 period of performance start date with a total period of performance of 60 months. Utilizing this single source procurement for the next 12 months will allow for the continuity of CWO services and assurance that the program complies with Public Law 115-141 until the Agency awards the next 60 months contracts. 
A market research announcement was posted on:  https://faaco.faa.gov/index.cfm/announcement/view/29346. 
A competitive solicitation is not available for this requirement. The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals and is not liable for any costs associated proposals prepared in response to this announcement.  
The weather observers are defined in the Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations at https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/wage/p29621.htm that includes the following description:
29621 Weather Observer, Combined Upper Air & Surface Programs (Meteorological Technician)
Takes, records and disseminates rawinsonde and surface observations, and completes forms in accordance with Federal Meteorological Handbooks and instructions provided by the National Weather Service as follows: (1) Prepares balloon, radiosonde and ground equipment for flight, performing pre-release checks and monthly optical comparative flights to ensure proper calibration of equipment; (2) Makes surface observations periodically and as required, special and local observations. Documents rawinsonde observation of atmospheric pressure, temperature, relative humidity, and wind direction and speeds aloft, using automatic methods. Obtains data of cloud height, wind atmospheric transmissivity, pressure and precipitation from autographic records. Performs rawinsonde observations, utilizing semi-automatic methods when automatic radiotheodolite equipment fails, and observes, evaluates and codes flight data. Performs prescribed quality control checks, and notifies personnel of problem areas. Disseminates observations by National Weather Service/Federal Aviation Administration approved systems. Federal Aviation Administration Contract Weather Observers do not perform upper air soundings. 
The Service Contract Act through the Department of Labor (DOL) and multiple Collective Bargaining Agreements (CBA) apply to these contracts. 
The management of the program is centralized at FAA Headquarters in Washington DC. It is managed under the Contract Tower and Aviation Weather Program, AJT-2230.

<CONTACT>Denise Y. Sydnor, Contract Specialist, Phone 3012868086, Email denise.y.sydnor@nasa.gov
<DESC>NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has a requirement for a 2x30 and 7x8 pixel Mercury Cadmium Telluride (HgCdTe) linear mode photon counting (LMPC) Avalanche Photodiode (APD) focal plane array (FPA) in a liquid nitrogen Dewar housing.
<p>NASA/GSFC intends to issue a sole-source Request for Proposal (RFP) to Leonardo DRS, Incorporated, for the HgCdTe LMPC APD FPA.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>NASA/GSFC, in partnership with Leonardo DRS, submitted a proposal entitled "Linear Mode Photon Counting HgCdTe Avalanche Photodiode Arrays for Multi-beam Laser Altimeters" to the NASA Research Announcement (NRA) NNH17ZDA001N-PICASSO, Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES-2017), Program Element C.12, Instrument Concepts for the Advancement of Solar System Observations (PICASSO) Program.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>On April 11, 2018, NASA Headquarters selected this proposal to provide support to NASA.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>DRS will support the development of an advanced detector for swath mapping lidar.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The period of performance is 26 months after the award.</p>
<p>Leonardo DRS is uniquely qualified because of their qualification and past performance of the prospective vendor as described below:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>(a) Leonardo DRS is the original inventor of this type of HgCdTe APD, trademarked HDVIP&Ograve; (high-density vertically-integrated photodiode), that has achieved the required performance. Leonardo DRS' fabrication process is proprietary.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Leonardo DRS has been producing this type of device since 2011 and has published several articles in peer reviewed scientific journals about the device.</p>
<p>(b) NASA GSFC has collaborated with Leonardo DRS to modify the LMPC HgCdTe APD array design for space lidar applications since 2012 under a NASA Earth Science Technology Office (ESTO) Advanced Component Technology (ACT) program in 2012-2015. NASA Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL) has subsequently worked with Leonardo DRS from 2015-2018 under another ESTO ACT program to further advance the technologies for passive radiometer applications. Leonardo DRS has steadily improved the device performance and reliability under these past NASA investments.</p>
<p>(c) NASA GSFC have been using the HgCdTe APD arrays from Leonardo DRS in third-party laboratory cryo-coolers in the airborne CO2 and CH4 lidar experiments since 2014. Leonardo DRS has developed a mature technology to integrate their HgCdTe APD detector with these third party cryo-coolers. NASA GSFC has also developed interface electronics, control software, and signal processing techniques for this type of detectors. Procuring the device in a similar cooler housing will save development time at GSFC.</p>
<p>(d) Leonardo DRS has been producing large array size LMPC HgCdTe APD arrays for other US government customers since 2013 in different operational modes. Leonardo DRS have already designed the 2x30 and 7x8 pixel subarrays alongside the larger array as test structures. It is much lower risk to procure the 2x30 and 7x8 pixel array devices from Leonardo DRS using their existing design with test data.</p>
<p>(e) The HgCdTe APD FPAs produced by Leonardo DRS have been tested for radiation damage from proton and gamma ray at NASA GSFC. The test data shows they are capable of withstanding space radiation for a typical multi-year space mission.</p>
<p>Statutory authority for this sole source procurement is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)--Only One Responsible Source.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, organizations who believe they can provide these services without any detrimental impact to the program schedules supported by this work should fully identify their interest and capabilities within 15 days after publication of this synopsis.</p>
<p>Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on September 14, 2018.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>See Note 26.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>An Ombudsman has been appointed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>See NASA Specific Note "B".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.</p>

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INTRODUCTION</span></strong><br />PURSUANT TO FAR Subpart 5.2-Synopses of Proposed Contract Actions, THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE OF A PROPOSED CONTRACT TO ACTION.
<p>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT OR PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME).</p>
<p>The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to award a purchase order to BrainXell, Inc. for services to grow human cortical glutamatergic neurons. The rationale for this sole source is BrainXell utilizes a unique, proprietary mixture of growth factors that accelerate the rate of maturation of the neurons into fully mature neurons in less than five (5) days after thawing.</p>
<p><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE</span></strong><br />The intended procurement is classified under NAICS code 325414 - Biological Product (except Diagnostic) Manufacturing and the small business size standard 1,250.</p>
<p><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">REGULATORY AUTHORITY</span></strong><br />The resultant contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses of the Federal acquisition Requlation (FAR) in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-100, dated August 22, 2018.</p>
<p><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">STATUTORY AUTHORITY</span></strong> <br />This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures, Subpart 13.106-1 (b) (1), Soliciting from a single source.</p>
<p><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Project Description</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Title</strong>: Human Cortical Glutamatergic Neurons</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong>: The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) focuses on getting more treatments to more patients more quickly. Several thousand genetic diseases affect humans, of which only about 500 have any treatment. NCATS is directly addressing this problem by discovering new technologies and other approaches that could greatly accelerate the process of developing and deploying solutions that can be used by all translational researchers.</p>
<p>The Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases (TRND) biology program's mission is to encourage and speed the development of new treatments for diseases with high-unmet medical needs. N-glycanase 1 (NGLY1) deficiency is an ultra rare, multi-system disease characterized by neurological disorders. To study the pathophysiology of this disease and to facilitate therapeutic development, we have generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from NGLY1 patient fibroblasts as a disease model. The iPSCs now need to be differentiated into disease relevant cells types, specifically, cortical glutamatergic neurons. In patient iPSC-derived neurons, we will investigate cellular phenotypes caused by loss of NGLY1 function and aberrant deglycosylation. In a parallel study, once a disease-specific phenotype is identified, we will perform high-throughput screening of NCATS' compound collection to identify lead compounds for drug development.</p>
<p>The contractor will grow the stem cells into actual neurons that have the NGLY1 phenotype. BrainXell will send the neurons to TRND for further testing. The contractor shall be responsible for validating the patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), producing the neurons, and assessing the quality of the neurons.</p>
<p><strong>Project Requirements</strong>: The contractor will receive frozen iPSCs, provided by TRND, that were derived from patients with a lysosomal storage disease. The iPSCs TRND is sending out have the disease phenotype. Contractor will thaw and culture the iPSC line to validate its quality. If necessary, contractor will select and expand high-quality sub-colonies within the culture before neural differentiation. Contractor will produce 20 vials of human cortical glutamatergic neurons from the iPSCs lines.

<DESC>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) plans to solicit proposals under full and open competition procedures from qualified organizations having the capability to identify and quantify drugs and their metabolites in biological fluids and tissues such as plasma/serum, urine, sweat, saliva, hair and brain and other tissues. The Contractor must be able to:
<div><br /></div>
<div>(1)	analyze experimental samples for drug concentrations in biological fluids and/or tissues;</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>(2)	develop more specific and sensitive methods for existing drugs or compounds and provide analytical validations for such methods; and</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>(3)	develop assays that are not currently available for compounds for which specific and sensitive assays are required by the drug abuse research community.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The research drugs may include cannabinoids, opiates, amphetamines, l alpha acetyl methadol (LAAM), naltrexone, methadone, cocaine, phencyclidine, anabolic steroids, opioid peptides and peptidomimetics, benzodiazepines and other drugs and their metabolites. The concentrations of such drugs and metabolites usually appear in biological materials at ng/g or ng/ml levels and therefore require the use of state of the art chromatography methods for separation and highly sensitive instrumentations for identification and quantification, such as gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC MS), liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and LC-MS-MS.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>This is a follow-on procurement to Contract Number HHSN271701400012C titled "Quantification of Drugs of Abuse and Related Substances in Biological Specimens."  It is estimated that a cost reimbursement, level of effort type contract will result from this procurement which will include a one-year base period and four one-year options to extend performance.</div>

<DESC>Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, New Jersey, intends to issue a limited competition between Advanced Technical Group, Inc. (ATG) and their authorized distributor, for a firm fixed-price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract for the procurement of a minimum quantity of one (1) each, and a maximum quantity of twenty (20) each ARINC 429 Data Bus Analyzers (Part Number (P/N) 01-1001-12; NSN: 7035-01-577-8438). The ARINC 429 Data Bus Analyzer is for the P-8A Poseidon Program for the United States Navy (USN), Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers. This analyzer provides avionics technicians and line maintenance personnel the capability to test the air data inertial reference system. Market research was conducted and confirmed that ATG and its authorized distributor, are the only valid sources that can provide the required item because they were selected by Boeing based on interface requirements in which the Government does not possess. The commercial common SE was selected by Boeing based on 737 interface requirements which was not developed at Government expense, therefore the Government does not possess the data rights, the interface requirements or the functionality requirements for all commercial common pieces of SE and cannot evaluate other competitors. An adequate purchase description or other information suitable to solicit by full and open competition has not been developed because the Government does not have sufficient engineering data or drawings to organically design the above items and enable a competitive procurement. Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, the Government will consider all responses received to this notice. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to full and open competition based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

If co-mingling must be allowed to meet the requirements of the business need, the contractor must ensure that FHCC s information is returned to the FHCC or destroyed in accordance with FHCC s sanitization requirements. FHCC reserves the right to conduct onsite inspections of contractor and subcontractor IT resources to ensure data security controls, separation of data and job duties, and destruction/media sanitization procedures are in compliance with FHCC directive requirements.

D. The contractor/subcontractor must receive, gather, store, back up, maintain, use, disclose and dispose of FHCC information only in compliance with the terms of the contract and applicable Federal and FHCC information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies. If Federal or FHCC information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies become applicable to the FHCC information or information systems after execution of the contract, or if NIST issues or updates applicable FIPS or Special Publications (SP) after execution of this contract, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to implement the information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies in this contract. 
E. The contractor/subcontractor shall not make copies of FHCC information except as authorized and necessary to perform the terms of the agreement or to preserve electronic information stored on contractor/subcontractor electronic storage media for restoration in case any electronic equipment or data used by the contractor/subcontractor needs to be restored to an operating state. If copies are made for restoration purposes, after the restoration is complete, the copies must be appropriately destroyed. 
F. If the FHCC determines that the contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality, privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for the FHCC to withhold payment to the contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12. 
G. If a FHCC contract is terminated for cause, any associated BAA must also be terminated and appropriate actions taken in accordance with VHA Handbook 1600.01, Business Associate Agreements.

K. Notwithstanding the provision above, the contractor/subcontractor shall not release VA records protected by Title 38 U.S.C. 5705, confidentiality of medical quality assurance records and/or Title 38 U.S.C. 7332, confidentiality of certain health records pertaining to drug addiction, sickle cell anemia, alcoholism or alcohol abuse, or infection with human immunodeficiency virus. If the contractor/subcontractor is in receipt of a court order or other requests for the above mentioned information, that contractor/subcontractor shall immediately refer such court orders or other requests to the FHCC contracting officer for response. 
L. For service that involves the storage, generating, transmitting, or exchanging of FHCC sensitive information but does not require C&A or an MOU-ISA for system interconnection, the contractor/subcontractor must complete a Contractor Security Control Assessment (CSCA) on a yearly basis and provide it to the COR.
LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR DATA BREACH
A. Consistent with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. Â§5725, a contract may require access to sensitive personal information. If so, the contractor is liable to the FHCC for liquidated damages in the event of a data breach or privacy incident involving any SPI the contractor/subcontractor processes or maintains under this contract. 
B. The contractor/subcontractor shall provide notice to the FHCC of a  security incident  as set forth in the Security Incident Investigation section above. Upon such notification, the FHCC must secure from a non-Department entity or the FHCC Office of Inspector General an independent risk analysis of the data breach to determine the level of risk associated with the data breach for the potential misuse of any sensitive personal information involved in the data breach. The term 'data breach' means the loss, theft, or other unauthorized access, or any access other than that incidental to the scope of employment, to data containing sensitive personal information, in electronic or printed form, that results in the potential compromise of the confidentiality or integrity of the data. Contractor shall fully cooperate with the entity performing the risk analysis. Failure to cooperate may be deemed a material breach and grounds for contract termination.
C. Each risk analysis shall address all relevant information concerning the data breach, including the following: 
(1) Nature of the event (loss, theft, unauthorized access); 
(2) Description of the event, including: 
(a) date of occurrence; 
(b) data elements involved, including any PII, such as full name, social security number, 
date of birth, home address, account number, disability code; 
(3) Number of individuals affected or potentially affected; 
(4) Names of individuals or groups affected or potentially affected; 
(5) Ease of logical data access to the lost, stolen or improperly accessed data in light of the degree of protection for the data, e.g., unencrypted, plain text; 
(6) Amount of time the data has been out of FHCC control; 
(7) The likelihood that the sensitive personal information will or has been compromised 
(made accessible to and usable by unauthorized persons); 
(8) Known misuses of data containing sensitive personal information, if any; 
(9) Assessment of the potential harm to the affected individuals; 
(10) Data breach analysis as outlined in 6500.2 Handbook, Management of Security and 
Privacy Incidents, as appropriate; and 
(11) Whether credit protection services may assist record subjects in avoiding or mitigating 
the results of identity theft based on the sensitive personal information that may have been 
compromised.
D. Based on the determinations of the independent risk analysis, the contractor shall be responsible for paying to the FHCC liquidated damages in the amount of $37.50 per affected individual to cover the cost of providing credit protection services to affected individuals consisting of the following: 
(1) Notification; 
(2) One year of credit monitoring services consisting of automatic daily monitoring of at least 
3 relevant credit bureau reports; 
(3) Data breach analysis; 
(4) Fraud resolution services, including writing dispute letters, initiating fraud alerts and 
credit freezes, to assist affected individuals to bring matters to resolution; 
(5) One year of identity theft insurance with $20,000.00 coverage at $0 deductible; and
(6) Necessary legal expenses the subjects may incur to repair falsified or damaged credit records, histories, or financial affairs.

Physical Security & Safety Requirements:

The Contractor and their personnel shall wear visible identification at all times while they are on the premises.
The FHCC does not provide parking spaces at the work site; the Contractor must obtain parking at the work site if needed.Â  It is the responsibility of the Contractor to park in the appropriate designated parking areas.Â  The FHCC will not invalidate or make reimbursement for parking violations of the Contractor under any conditions.
Smoking is prohibited inside/outside any building other than the designated smoking areas.
Possession of weapons is prohibited.
The Contractor shall obtain all necessary licenses and/or permits required to perform the work, with the exception of software licenses that need to be procured from a Contractor or vendor in accordance with the requirements document.  The Contractor shall take all reasonable precautions necessary to protect persons and property from injury or damage during the performance of this contract.
The Contracting Officer will be the sole authorized official to release in writing, any data, draft deliverables, final deliverables, or any other written or printed materials pertaining to this contract.

Acquisition sensitive information shall be marked "Acquisition Sensitive" and shall be handled as "For Official Use Only (FOUO)".
Contractor does not require access to classified data.
Regulatory standard of conduct governs all personnel directly and indirectly involved in procurements.Â  All personnel engaged in procurement and related activities shall conduct business in a manner above reproach and, except as authorized by statute or regulation, with complete impartiality and with preferential treatment for none.Â  The general rule is to strictly avoid any conflict of interest or even the appearance of a conflict of interest in FHCC/Contractor relationships.

Government-Furnished Equipment (GFE) / Government-Furnished Information. None.

Other Pertinent Information or Special Considerations.  
In addition to the requirements detailed in Para 7, the contractor will be required to register through RAPIDGate registration for Naval Base Great Lakes access. 
REQUIRED REGISTRATION WITH CONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT SYSTEM (CPARS). As prescribed in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 42.15, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) evaluates contractor past performance on all contracts that exceed the thresholds outlined in FAR Part 42.15, and shares those evaluations with other Federal Government contract specialists and procurement officials through the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS).Â  The FAR requires that the contractor be provided an opportunity to comment on past performance evaluations prior to the posting of each report.Â  To fulfill this requirement VA uses an online database, the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS).Â  The CPARS database information is uploaded to the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) database, which is available to all Federal agencies.

Each contractor whose contract award is estimated to exceed the thresholds outlined in FAR Part 42.15 is required to provide to the contracting officer contact information for the contractor s representative with their response to the solicitation.Â  The contractor is responsible to notify the contracting officer of any change to the contractor s representative during the contract performance period.Â  Contractor s representative contact information consists of a name and email address.

The Government will register the contract within thirty days after contract award.Â  For contracts with a period of one year or less, the contracting officer will perform a single evaluation when the contract is complete.Â  For contracts exceeding one year, the contracting officer will evaluate the contractor s performance annually.Â  Intermediate reports will be filed each year until the last year of the contract, when the final report will be completed.Â  Each report shall be forwarded in CPARS to the contractor s designated representative for comment.Â  The contractor s representative will have thirty days to submit any comments and return the report to the VA contracting officer.Â  Failure by the contractor to respond within those thirty days will result in the Government s evaluation being placed on file in PPIRS without contractor s comments.

Health and Human Services/Office of Inspector General (HHS/OIG).  To ensure that the individuals providing services under the contract have not engaged in fraud or abuse regarding Sections 1128 and 1128A of the Social Security Act regarding federal health care programs, the contractor is required to check the HHS/OIG, List of Excluded Individuals/Entities on the OIG Website (www.hhs.gov/oig) for each person providing services under this contract.  Further the Contractor is required to certify in its proposal that all persons listed in the contractor s proposal have been compared against the OIG list and are NOT listed.  During the performance of this contract the Contractor is prohibited from using any individual or business listed on the List of Excluded Individuals/Entities.

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Compliance.  Contractor must adhere to the provisions of Public Law 104-191, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 and the National Standards to Protect the Privacy and Security of Protected Health Information (PHI).  As required by HIPAA, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has promulgated rules governing the security and use and disclosure of protected health information by covered entities, including the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  In accordance with HIPAA, the Contractor may be required to enter into a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with VA.  Optical Dispensing Services qualifies as a medical service   therefore, no BAA is required.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) intends to award a sole source firm-fixed price purchase order to Koetter Fire Protection (KFP), 16069 Central Commerce Dr., Pflugerville, TX 78660 to procure annual maintenance and emergency/non-emergency repair services for the four (4) Very Early Warning Aspirating Smoke Detection (VESDA) systems, model VLS-314, and 2 VESDA systems, model VLS-304, located in Austin, TX.

Koetter Fire Protection is the only source to perform this requirement because of the required access to the existing Simplex Grinnell master fire panel, which controls the VA-Austin Information Technology Center (AITC) fire detection system. VA-AITC must manage and oversee the maintenance of the fire protection systems in the AITC computer rooms which house critical information on Veteran s services, records, and operations. In 2010 General Services Administration (GSA) awarded a contract to perform facility maintenance services for the AITC which includes maintenance of the fire protection system for the entire facility. 

In 2014, GSA awarded a new contract to continue these services under contract number GS-07P-14-JU-D-0039, awarded to SDS JV. Koetter Fire Protection has provided maintenance services for the AITC Simplex Grinnell master fire panel for over seven years, as a subcontractor under both GSA contracts. In 2010, VA-AITC installed an upgraded fire detection system in computer rooms 134 and 140. The installation of the new equipment was not within the scope of the existing GSA facility maintenance contract. However, Koetter Fire Protection was awarded a sole source contract for the equipment and installation of the upgraded VESDA system in these computer rooms due to its  exclusive access under the GSA contract to the existing Simplex Grinnell master fire panel and inherent knowledge to configure the new equipment to ensure compatibility and interoperability with the existing system. This approach provided continuity of services and minimized the technical risk of multiple sources accessing a critical safety system. 

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all quotations/responses received within seven (7) days of the issuance of this notice will be considered by the Government; September 07, 2018 @ 3:00 pm CST. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely to determine whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

Any quotation/response should be emailed to Aaron Waltersdorff, Contract Specialist at e-mail address aaron.waltersdorff@va.gov; phone 512-981-4469.

<DESC>SUBJECT: Sources Sought Notice Request: Inertial Navigation Units
<p>Sources Sought Notice</p>
<p>This announcement will be used as a market research tool. The Government is in the position to research commercially available Inertial Navigation Units (INU) for possible future acquisitions for the M7A2 Bradley Fire Support Team Vehicle (BFIST) Situational Awareness (SA) and the M7A3 BFIST. The INUs shall be produced and meet the requirements of the "Performance Specification for the Inertial Navigation System (INS) for the A3 Bradley Fire Support Vehicle (A3 BFIST)", #19207-12471192 Revision A, dated 24 July 2017.</p>
<p>A general description of the required item is as follows: The INU would function as an inertial reference system and land navigator for a variety of military systems in support of the Soldier. This inertial navigation platform would be required to interact with an array of previously established system components with no decrease in current operating capabilities. The potential systems range from basic personnel carriers to complex weapons and/or sensing platforms with a varying degree of sensitivity and accuracy requirements. A single INU design need not be able to perform with every system so multiple versions would be acceptable. Minor modifications for mission support would be also expected. No Government-owned interface control document (ICD) is currently available. Any information that is provided and/or potentially developed by any prospective supplier would remain proprietary unless/until rights are purchased by the Government. The system(s) shall be required to meet performance specifications, space constraints, environmental, functional, operational, functional and interface requirements of the platform's the INU supports without degrading individual system performance both on a stand-alone basis and in concert with other systems with which that system supports while the other systems may be utilizing other contractors units.</p>
<p>The USG acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1905: The Trade Secrets Act to protect confidential information provided to the USG. Pursuant to this statute, the USG is willing to accept proprietary restrictions placed upon data presented in response to this survey and to protect such information from unauthorized disclosure, subject to the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Data must be in writing and be clearly marked PROPRIETARY and be accompanied by an explanatory text so that the USG is clearly notified regarding what data is proprietary.</p>
<p>&bull; Mark as proprietary only data that is truly confidential and to which there is a legal property right.</p>
<p>&bull; Do not mark data that is already in the public domain or is already in possession of the USG or third parties on an unclassified basis. Do not mark data that is available to the USG or to the public without restriction from another source.</p>
<p>&bull; Do not submit any classified data in response to this market survey.</p>
<p>&bull; Proprietary data transmitted electronically must have the PROPRIETARY legend on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail as well as at the beginning of the file. Proprietary information contained within the correspondence shall use the legends: "PROPRIETARY PORTION BEGINS" and "PROPRIETARY PORTION ENDS."</p>
<p>The purpose of this notice is to identify and establish initial interest and points of contact from private industry. This information may be used to design acquisition strategy to include socioeconomic program support. It may also help to identify and establish commercial practices available to the Government.</p>
<p>All responses to this notice should include the following: Company Name, Point of Contact, Address, Telephone and Fax Numbers, E-mail address, Brief Description of Company/Capabilities, Experience areas, Contract History, DUNS Number, CAGE Code and/or Tax ID Number, as well as Size Category (Large/Small Disadvantage, etc). Also provide any supporting information such as commercial literature, catalogues, manuals, etc.</p>
<p>The requested date for receipt of responses to this announcement is no later than 14 Sep 2018. Upon receipt and analysis of information, potential vendors may be contacted for possible appointments for further discussion and exploration.</p>
<p>The Government will not award a Contract from this announcement. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation, nor is it a request seeking participants to be placed on a solicitation mailing list. Responses to these notices are not offers and the Government cannot accept the responses to form a binding contract.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUCEMENT. This is a sources sought synopsis only. The purpose of this synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their business size classification (HUBZone, 8(a), Small Business, Small Disadvantaged, Small Veteran Owned Business or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business) relative to NAICS Code 611430- Professional and Management Development (Size Standard of $11 million) The Government will utilize responses to determine the appropriate procurement methodology. After review of the responses to this sources sought synopsis, a solicitation announcement may be published to the public on the Federal Business Opportunities website at www.fbo.gov. Responses to this sources sought synopsis shall not be considered a response to a solicitation and will be used only as market research. Again, this is a sources sought notification that is intended only for informational and planning purposes only. Interested parties shall not construe it as a solicitation, obligation, or commitment by the Government at this time. <br />The New Hampshire Air National Guard (NHANG) has a total petroleum, oil, and lubricant (POL) storage capacity of over 1,000,000 gallons and is required to prepare and follow the regulations within a Facility Response Plan (FRP). The NHANG requires spill response training for 30 to 50 members of its Spill Response Team (SRT) to include both classroom and field training to prevent and mitigate the accidental releases of POL to the natural environment. Training shall include the use of dikes, berms, dams, trenches, etc. to restrict the flow of POL spills and the use of sorbents, booms, skimmers, and other spill abatement devices to complete spill clean-up actions. In responding to this sources sought synopsis, companies should propose the number of hours/days needed for both classroom and field work with a maximum training length of 3-5 days. The training will primarily take place on-location at Pease ANGB.
<p>The training must provide instruction on the latest immediate action emergency spill response strategies and techniques to SRT members IAW 40 CFR Part 112. The training should also emphasize small, and medium petroleum, oil, and lubricant (POL) spills which SRT members are likely to encounter at Pease ANGB as well as off-base emergency response locations that are likely to be impacted by a POL release. Additionally, interested parties should be prepared to analyze the existing Base Facility Response Plan (FRP) and recommend improvements to emergency spill response equipment stored on base used to respond to POL spills prior to or following the spill training event to improve the effectiveness of SRT emergency responses.</p>
<p>The Government intends to issue a FIRM FIXED PRICE contract should a solicitation be issued and award made. <br />If interested, parties capable of providing the required services shall provide the following information:</p>
<p>(1) Is your business currently registered as a small business?</p>
<p>(2) If small, does your company qualify as a small emerging business, or small disadvantage business?</p>
<p>(3) If disadvantaged, specify under which disadvantaged group it falls under and if your company is certified under the Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act?</p>
<p>(4) Is your company a certified HUBZone entity?</p>
<p>(5) Is your company a woman-owned business?<br /><br />(6) Is your company a certified Service-Disabled Veteran Owned organization?</p>
<p>(7) Is your company a Veteran Owned Small Business? Small business concerns that are considering participation in this potential solicitation process under any Small Business Set-aside shall do so in accordance with the Small Business Act.</p>
<p>If interested, please email your responses to the attention of matthew.r.lapointe.mil@mail.mil. The Government will not accept responses telephonically. Interested parties must respond no later than 4:30 pm on 20 September 2018. This notice is to assist in determining availability from capable commercial sources only. If the government issues a solicitation, all interested parties shall respond to that announcement separately from this source sought.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA's Air Resources Laboratory (ARL) requires a vendor to conduct scientific research flights in the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area to measure concentrations of short- and long-lived trace pollutants in the atmosphere, with the specific aim of evaluating the performance of meteorological models in predicting transport and dispersion in the planetary boundary layer (PBL).
<p>The required research flights will be used to evaluate the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model that has been developed and improved by NOAA/ARL.</p>
<p>The HYSPLIT model is a complete system for computing simple air parcel trajectories, as well as complex transport, dispersion, chemical transformation, and deposition simulations. HYSPLIT is one of the most extensively used atmospheric transport and dispersion models in the atmospheric sciences community. Parameters used in the HYSPLIT model need to be evaluated based on atmospheric observations to improve the accuracy of the model results.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:<br />This project aims to evaluate and improve the HYSPLIT dispersion model, especially for the application of the model in the PBL. As a result, a number of chemical and meteorological parameters from the aircraft must be measured and recorded. Trace gas and aerosol detectors will be provided by the University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP) and/or ARL, as will instrument racks to securely house the instruments.</p>
<p>The successful vendor must be capable of supplying an aircraft with a minimum instrument payload of approximately 500 pounds, an effective range of approximately 600 nm, and an endurance of approximately 3.5-4 hours, with one pilot and one scientist aboard. The vendor must measure and report all relevant wind, meteorological, and aircraft attitude (roll, pitch, yaw, altitude, true airspeed, ground speed, position) parameters. Position, attitude, and velocity measurements should be made with differential GPS techniques. ARL staff will be responsible for integrating the instrument payload into the aircraft, with technical and engineering support from the vendor, as needed. To the extent practicable, all measurements should be calibrated with NIST-traceable instruments and techniques.</p>
<p>DELIVERABLE SCHEDULE:<br />The vendor will conduct approximately 12 research flights (~3 hours each flight, totaling 36 flights hours) after October 1, 2018, but before September 30, 2019. The flight crew will help ARL scientists to collect meteorological and chemical data during those flights to evaluate the HYSPLIT model, and will deliver to ARL data sets containing all measured platform parameters (meteorology, winds, 3-dimensional aircraft position and attitude, etc.).</p>
<p>SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS:<br />The vendor will assist ARL scientists to develop flight plans (i.e., where and when to fly, subject to airspace restrictions and FAA-mandated minimum flight altitudes over populated areas).  When a flight request comes from ARL scientist, the flight crew will provide flight hours for the ARL scientists to collect airborne data to be used to evaluate the HYSPLIT model.</p>
<p>The successful vendor must be capable of supplying engineering and limited machining services to aid in the installation and integration of trace gas and aerosol detectors, and the calculation of aircraft weight and balance, and must assume responsibility for arranging and supplying services (fuel, ground power, hangar space if needed) at FBOs to be determined based on specific flight plans.</p>
<p>Most significantly, the successful vendor must supply an inlet system, certified by the Federal Aviation Administration, to direct ambient air to the chemical measurement systems via manifold tubing, or similar. The preferred location of this inlet is at and well ahead of the nose of the aircraft, to allow the sampling of air parcels uninfluenced by turbulence or aircraft engine exhaust.</p>
<p>Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within ten days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Evidence must be provided of ability to provide the required service.  The announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  A contract will be issued in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR 6.302-1 (C).  The associated NAICS Code is 532411.</p>
<p>Offers will be evaluated based on price, proven technical capabilities, and the factors set forth above.  An award will be made to the entity who can meet the specific requirements and is most advantageous to the Government considering price and other related factors on an all or none basis.  This will be a firm fixed-price purchase order, with payment terms of Net 30.</p>
<p>No other additional contractual terms and conditions are applicable. In order to comply with the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, ALL Vendors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM.gov)</p>
<p>All proposals are required to be received in the contracting office no later than 11:00 am, EST, on Friday, September 7, 2018.

<p>a. The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1.	Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2.	Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the<br />Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3.	Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her.<br />Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1.	Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A-176 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p><br />4.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6.	The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the<br />Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7.	The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f.  The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g. Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>
