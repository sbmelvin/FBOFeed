<DESC>USAID will post a request for proposals (RFP) for indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) time and materials (T&M) contracts for technical assistance in the area of international anti-corruption.  The RFP will be posted o/a March 25, 2002. Proposals will be due on May 8, 2002. 

The worldwide trend towards democratization and the growing understanding of the costs of corruption have allowed USAID and other USG agencies greater opportunities to engage in efforts to fight corruption around the globe.  By supporting efforts by host government institutions, civil society organizations (including the media, youth, labor union and faith-based organizations) and the private sector, USAID seeks to promote greater transparency, accountability and broader participation in the development process.  The U.S.  Congress recognized the importance of anti-corruption and good governance assistance by passing the Anti-Corruption and Good Governance Act of 2000 (P.L.  106-309).  This law adds promotion of good governance as part of overall U.S.  development assistance policy and authorizes an array of activities designed to combat corruption and improve transparency and good governance in developing countries of particular interest to the United States.

Consistent with these goals, the objective of this activity is to curb governmental corruption in both political and bureaucratic offices.  This activity focuses on unilateral abuses by governmental officials such as embezzlement and nepotism, as well as abuses linking public and private actors such as bribery, extortion, influence peddling, and fraud.  Governmental integrity support activities under this contract are expected to encompass the following functional areas: (a) public financial, administrative, regulatory and personnel controls that promote transparency and accountability; (b) civil society participation in advocating for governmental integrity; and (c) promoting synergies between anti-corruption promotion and other sectoral/sub-sectoral areas, e.g., promoting greater transparency in other sectors, such as health and education, or in other areas of democracy promotion, such as rule of law or decentralization.

NAICS is 541611. This procurement is full and open competition with a partial small business set aside. Order of magnitude threshold: (estimated) $85,000,000.00. Numbered/nonnumbered notes do not apply.

<DESC>The United States Air Force Academy intends to acquire services under Parts 12 and 13 from the University of Notre Dame.  The statement of work requires the contractor to investigate the effectiveness of phased plasma actuators in controlling transonic flow over a surface.  In particular, low-power electrodes separated by thin insulators will be used to create confined, weakly-ionized plasmas, hereafter referred to as plasma actuators.  Various geometric configurations of these actuators will be placed just upstream, directly under and just downstream of weak shocks formed in a transonic flow, and the changes in the shocks' properties from their undisturbed values will be documented.  These studies will be carried out in one of the in-draft, transonic tunnels located in the Hessert Center for Aerospace Research at Notre Dame.  In addition, Dr. Eric Jumper will participate as a Co-P.I. on continued studies at the Air Force Academy studying the efficacy of using the plasma actuators directly as synthetic control surfaces, hereafter referred to as plasma flaps.  These plasma flaps have already been demonstrated to be effective in 50 ft/s flows; the continued work will concentrate on scaling these low-speed results to higher speeds more applicable to munitions applications.  In addition, work at the Academy will continue in the attempt to understand the basic power requirements and flow phenomena associated with these plasma actuators. The general tasks for this next phase of research are as follows:  1) Perform a series of experiments in transonic wind tunnels to investigate plasma actuator effects on weak shocks. Employ static pressure taps, total pressure probes, and plasma actuators as necessary to determine if plasma actuators can be used to adjust shock wave and placement on munitions performance.  2) Serve as consultant during testing and data reduction involving the power requirements to produce effective plasma at the USAFA Aeronautics Research Center. Participate in deciding the approach to developing the scaling laws necessary to scale up the size of the actuators.  3) Serve as Co-Principal Investigator for research investigating the scaling of plasma flaps in all necessary Aeronautics Research Center wind tunnels. Participate in the decisions regarding research direction to pursue at each stage, selection of appropriate experimental configurations, and all test plan development, data reduction, interpretation, and presentation.  4) Serve as consultant during testing and data reduction involving measurement and modeling of the plasma-flow interaction. Review measurements and computational results.   Assist in determining research results from all investigations.  Interested firms have FOUR (4) days from the publication of this synopsis to submit in writing to the identified point of contact, their qualifications/capabilities. Such qualifications/capabilities will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  Responses received after the FOUR (4) days or without the required information will be considered non-responsive to the synopsis and will not be considered.  Based upon responses to this notice, a determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competitive basis, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the agency.  An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>Air Force Research Laboratory, (AFRL/PRKB ) will be soliciting research proposals for the TERC Enhancement and Sustainment . This is an IDIQ five-year effort with an estimated value of $4.9M to support  research, development, enhancement & sustainment of the TERC including measurement, data acquisition, analysis, control, & computer systems used for the measurement & analysis of experimental turbine engine components.  Delivery Order 01 will be issued with the award of the basic contract.  Estimated value of DO 01 is $3.5M for 5 years ($700K each year).  All Delivery Orders will be Cost Plus Fixed Fee.  Only one contract will be awarded as a result of this solicitation.  The procurement is unrestricted (not set-aside). The primary mission of the Turbine Engine Research Center (TERC) is to analyze and evaluate the aerodynamic and aeromechanical performance of advanced turbine engine components. To meet its mission, the TERC conceives, develops, operates and manages technology that:  Provides high quality data necessary to document performance;  Develops and applies state-of-the-art measurement techniques;  Develops, modifies and integrates advanced analytical tools in support of test requirements  Acquires, verifies, analyzes, manages and presents acquired data.  The objective of this contract is to research, develop and apply techniques, methods, software and hardware for the measurement and analysis of aerodynamic and aeromechanical parameters of experimental turbine engine components and to ensure the operational readiness of the TERC measurement, data acquisition, analysis, control, and computer systems. .  Facilities that are currently part of the TERC are:  COMPRESSOR RESEARCH FACILITY (CRF):  A compressor under test in the CRF is driven by one of two 30,000 horsepower synchronous electric motors coupled by a gearbox system that can drive the test compressor at rotational speeds of up to 30,000 revolutions per minute (RPM). Computer control and/or monitoring of all systems allows detailed study of the test compressor through immediate data analysis.  Drive motor speed, electrical power conditioning, inlet valve positions, discharge valve positions, and variable test compressor geometry (e.g., variable vanes, bleed valves) are all digitally controlled.  Test article lubrication, drive motor lubrication, actuator hydraulics, service air, cooling water, and auxiliary air systems are controlled by programmable logic controllers (PLCs).  The control system uses CAMAC hardware with 500+ analog input channels sampled at 100Hz per channel, 32 analog output channels, 48 digital input channels and 48 digital output channels. The computer systems are DEC alpha computers using the VMS operating system. The control software is primarily custom FORTRAN with some C  code.  The primary Test Article data system uses VXI hardware with 1500+ channels of analog input sampled at 60Hz per channel. Data acquisition is handled by an NT system using modified Kinetics Systems Visual Basic and C++ code. The online data reduction, display and data storage is handled by a DEC ALPHA using VMS running custom FORTRAN code.  The Aeromechanics data system is a UNIX system running custom C++ code and is used to acquire and process dynamic data (strain gage, high response pressure transducers, etc).  The data acquisition and control systems are tied to a common IRIG-B clock.  Additional software features allow pre-test development of a Test Article Data Base tailored to a compressor's unique requirements and post-test data playback for data analysis, reduction and display.  TURBINE RESEARCH FACILITY (TRF):    The TRF is a short duration test apparatus used to conduct aero-thermal investigations of phenomena relating to turbine components (primarily rotor and vane assemblies) The TRF contains all the support hardware, software and instrumentation required to run tests on advanced turbine designs..  The facility consists of a large tank filled with heated, pressurized gas, an evacuated test section, and two large evacuated dump tanks.  The test section is comprised of a turbine rotor section, which is spun up to a predetermined speed by an air motor, and then allowed to coast for a few seconds.  At the test speed, a valve is opened, allowing the pressurized test gas to flow through the test section that contains the spinning test rotor and on to the dump tanks.  The tests have a duration of two-to-five seconds.  The turbine rotor?s speed during the test is regulated and subsequently brought to rest by an eddy current dynamometer.  Facility health data is acquired throughout spin-up, test and spin-down.  Performance data, currently derived from 400 temperature, pressure, speed, torque and heat flux sensors, are acquired during the two-to-five seconds of blow-down.  Current data system capabilities allow sample rates of up to 1 MHz. Data acquisition is handled by an NT system using modified Kinetics Systems Visual Basic and C++ code. The online data reduction, display and data storage is handled by 2 SUN SOLARIS UNIX Systems running custom LabView and C code.  COMPRESSOR AERO RESEARCH LAB (CARL):  The CARL is used to investigate turbine engine compressor aerodynamic performance.  The test facility is powered by a 2,000 horsepower drive motor.  The facility is unique in that it is operated in a closed-loop fashion using state-of-the-art instrumentation and measurement systems that permit on-line precision calibrations of all steady-state pressure and temperature sensors.  The facility may be operated over a speed range of 6,000 to 21,500 RPM and a flow range of 15 to 65 lbs/sec.  Current standard instrumentation capabilities include:  100 temperature sensors, 160 steady-state pressure sensors, 32 channels of up to 280 kHz direct digital recording, parallel analog recording of up to 26 channels, and 4 active tip-clearance devices.  Both fixed and traversing instrumentation capabilities exist.  Laser-illuminated flow visualization techniques, Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDV), Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) also exist.  TURBINE ENGINE FATIGUE FACILITY (TEFF):  The primary mission of the TEFF is to investigate High Cycle Fatigue phenomena in turbine engine blades and disks. TEFF testing fills a gap between material coupon testing and actual engine system testing.  The research focus is on the growth of cracks in actual engine components when subjected to realistic stress scenarios induced by servo-hydraulic test frames and electro-dynamic shakers. Full-scale testing of turbine engine blades and disks using advanced analysis techniques such as Laser Vibrometry and Optical Rotation/De-rotation can also be accomplished.  FLOW RESEARCH LABORATORY (FRL).  The FRL supports TERC programs.  It is used to calibrate inlets, probes and other instrumentation devices and systems used in the CRF, TRF and CARL.  This facility is also used to develop and optimize advanced non-intrusive instrumentation techniques, such as laser and hot wire anemometry systems to measure the detailed flow field within turbine engines.   TURBINE ENGINE WIND TUNNEL RESEARCH FACILITIES.  The two cascade facilities are used to explore boundary layer control on low-pressure turbine blading at simulated Reynolds numbers.  The facility can operate at velocities up to 180 ft/sec, and turbulence levels up to 20%, with desired turning angles.  The physics of secondary, transitional and separated flows are investigated and boundary layer control techniques are being researched.  Key to the effective research performed in these facilities is the rapid prototyping of experimental turbine blades. TURBINE ENGINE FLAT PLATE RESEARCH FACILITY.  This facility is used to research the flow physics related to boundary conditions such as turbulence intensity levels and scales along with heat transfer measurements, to evaluate turbulence models and enhance computational fluid dynamics related to turbines.  The primary test unit consists of a two-foot by ten-foot flat plate section with electrical heating capability plus a five-foot unheated starting length, with zero pressure gradient.  Air is supplied at a maximum of 200 fps by a wall jet with interchangeable nozzles for shaping the flow.  The flat plate is equipped to investigate film cooling application techniques.  This unit is also used for flow visualization using laser sheet lighting, with and without cooling jet interactions. Two additional low-speed, two-dimensional, high turbulence units are available for leading edge or stagnation area film cooling research. These two additional units are used to research the effects of pressure gradient on film cooling with high turbulence levels.  Film cooling effectiveness and heat transfer coefficients are determined by transient liquid crystal or thermographic phosphor techniques.  Other advanced instrumentation includes three-component and two-component laser anemometry systems, two color Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) system for instantaneous 2D velocity measurements, three-component hot wire system, and high accuracy and precise spatial resolution arrays of 80+ thermocouples along the plate sections.  AEROSPACE FUELS RESEARCH COMPLEX - This facility provides the theoretical and practical knowledge needed to fuel cutting edge propulsion technology. By combining chemistry, computer skills, and hands on technology,  the Fuels Research Complex is creating more powerful, more affordable, and more environmentally friendly fuels for all aircraft and spacecraft needs.  Interested offerors may view and/or download the full  solicitation by accessing the Federal Business Opportuinies (FedBusOps) homepage at http://www.eps.gov/.  Direct questions to the Contracting point of contact identified in the announcement.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to purchase six Dioxin Power-Prep Sample Cleanup Systems/P6 as manufactured by Fluid Management Systems.  CDC believes that its requirements can only be met by this provider, however all responsible sources that can meet the requirements listed herein may submit a quote which will be considered by the agency.  Description of the requirements are a rapid method of analysis for dioxins, furans, coplanar PCBs, PCBs and persistent pesticides in human serum. Increase sample throughput of archived samples pending dioxin and PCB/persistent pesticide quantification by high resolution isotope-dilution mass spectrometry at ultra-trace levels. The system must be capable of performing sample clean-up and analyte enrichment on six serum sample extracts in parallel (or simultaneously) and collect multiple chromatographic fractions on each of the six samples in approximately one hour. The analyst can selectively program each chromatographic step in the automated sample preparation procedure using the FMS Windows based software. The system can handle up to five different solvents and up to three different chromatography columns. The software must control each of the six independent chromatography modules and is used to calibrate the flow-rate of the six solvent pumps, select different flow-rates at various steps during the procedure, and to reverse the flow of solvent required by CDC method to collect the dioxin fraction. All components that come into contact with solvents (including all tubing and valve seats) are made of Teflon or similar solvent resistant material. The system can perform clean-up on a wide range of serum sample sizes (0.5 ml to 50 ml) without changing column sizes.

<DESC>The United States Air Force Academy intends to acquire services under Parts 12 and 13 from the University of Notre Dame.  The statement of work requires the contractor to continue data reduction of unsteady pressure data along an airfoil surface (Inlet Guide Vane type probe, IGV probe) and the design and implementation of a data acquisition system to acquire flow field measurements downstream of the IGV probe.  The work is in direct support of a joint research program between the USAFA and the University of Notre Dame using the Honeywell F109 Turbofan engine, in place in Test Cell Number 3 of the USAFA Jet Engine Test Facility.  The research is part of the Air Force's High Cycle Fatigue (HCF) Correction Program that has been ongoing since FY 96. The general tasks for this next phase of research are as follows:  1) Continued data reduction of IGV probe data gained during FY01 engine testing.  This includes data gained from three probe designs:  sharp trailing edge IGV probe, semi-bluff trailing edge IGV probe and bluff trailing edge IGV probe.  2) Write and present two meeting papers regarding the data collected on the sharp and bluff trailing edge IGV probes. 3) Determine acceptable design for using USAFA's Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) system to acquire 2-Dimensional flow field measurements in the azimuthal plane downstream of the sharp and bluff trailing edge IGV probes.  4) Take preliminary 2-Dimensional velocity field measurements using PIV in the F109 inlet region just upstream of the fan..

<DESC>On November 15, 2001 the firms Ball Aerospace and Technologies Corp., of Boulder, CO (50-DGNE-2-90001), Raytheon Santa Barbara Remote Sensing, of Goleta, CA (50-DGNE-2-90002), and SpecTIR, Inc., also of Goleta, CA (50-DGNE-2-90003) were awarded Concept Exploration studies for $125,000 each to study the design, assess risks, prepare a management team, and perform CAIV trade studies for the NPOESS/Aerosol Polarimetry Sensor (APS).  This notice signifies the Government's intent to increase each of those studies by $600,000.  Each firm was required to deliver an initial and final technical interchange meeting, with supporting briefings and reports.  The Government has determined that it shall extend the breadth of the initial phase Concept Exploration by six months, to September 6, 2002, to facilitate expansion of competition among the three firms pending approval to proceed to the Sensor Design and Risk Reduction (SDRR) Phase, estimated to begin on or about mid-August 2002.  In the meantime this contract extension will expand the number of CAIV studies from the initial three to add additional studies related to spacecraft and component interfaces, scanning and hardware issues, etc.  The expanded deliverables shall include two additional interim TIMs, and a final report approaching an SRR.  In addition to the risk reduction achieved on these CAIV studies, reports on the life cycle costs and refinements in the design will be submitted.  The expansion of the scope of these studies will enhance competition and the reduce risks of development in the SDRR phase.  Based on this extension, the Government will reserve the right to down-select to a single vendor at SDRR award.  That next phase will be awarded on or about January 2003.  The authority for execution of this proposed contract by NOAA is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), "only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements".   This notice applies to all three firms noted above.  Any other party desiring consideration for this requirement must  identify its full capability in writing to the Contracting Officer within 45 days of this publication.  No RFP or solicitation is available.  No further CBD notice is planned.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   The U.S. EPA, Office of Research and Development intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Dr. Elaine Faustman under the authority of FAR Part 13 to develop case studies that illustrate the application of quantitative considerations (kinetic and dynamic factors) for developmental neurotoxicity.  The contractor shall develop four case studies that demonstrate the importance of considerations of kinetics and dynamics for quantitative developmental neurotoxicity.  Compounds with available robust data sets have been chosen to illustrate these considerations.  However, considerations for related but less well studied compounds will be drawn into the evaluations to improve understanding of how these methods could be applied to a broader range of toxicants.  The proposed chemicals chosen for these case studies are Methylmercury, Ethanol, Chlorpyrifos and  Benomyl.  Successful completion of the proposed project requires specific expertise in development of both kinetic and dynamic models of neurological development in various brain areas.  The contractor must have specific expertise in a number of areas:  pharmacokinetic modeling in the developing  rodent and maternal/fetal unit, an ongoing research program using embryonic cell cultures from specific brain regions to study the effects of neurotoxic agents, and expertise in risk assessment issues and processes.  Any firms believing itself capable of meeting EPA's requirements may submit  technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the statement of work.  Such documentation must be submitted to the POC within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice. A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely  within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition  Procedures.  The applicable NAICS code is 541620.  The anticipated award date is 03/31/2002.  See Numbered Note 1.

<DESC>The National Library of Medicine seeks to demonstrate the application of scalable, network aware, wireless, GIS and identification technologies to a networked health related environment.  Project proposals will focus on situations that will require or greatly benefit from the application of these technologies in health care, medical decision-making, public health, large-scale health emergencies, health education, and biomedical, clinical and health services research.  Projects must involve the use of testbed networks linking hospitals, clinics, the health practitioners' offices, patients' homes, health professional schools, medical libraries, universities, medical research centers and laboratories, and/or public health authorities to demonstrate revolutionary applications in healthcare, health education and medical research.  These significant, network dependent healthcare, health education or research applications will demonstrate one or more of the following capabilities:  1) Self-scaling applications; 2) Self-optimizing end-to-end network aware real-time applications and/or middleware; 3) Wireless applications; 4) Nomadic application and/or applications using geographic information systems (GIS) techniques; and 5) Applications which involve advanced identification methodologies, e.g., biometrics or smartcards.  These testbeds shall be designed to yield insight into three realms:  first, the biomedical and social value of the proposed testbed services to the individuals served; second, insight into the potential value of these services to the health delivery, public health or health education enterprise, or homeland defense initiative; and third, insight into particular elements of future advanced network capabilities or network specifications that are required for support of these capabilities.  Projects may range from being small in scope requiring small amounts of funding to very broad in scope requiring larger amounts of funding.  BAA RFP NLM 02-103/VMS will be available in electronic format only.  Paper copies will not be issued.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<SUBJECT>99--National Asset Supply Chain Management (ASCM) Integrated Services Contract (ISC)
<SOLNBR>2270
<RESPDATE>032902
<CONTACT>Kevin Hart, 781-238-7660
<DESC>The national Asset Supply Chain Management (ASCM) program represents an integrated solution aimed at addressing FAA-wide lifecycle asset management requirements.  The ASCM system will provide an efficient, effective, and integrated national system to provide asset management functions, thereby providing seamless support to headquarters, regional, and remote field users.  ASCM provides this support over several functional areas: <P>  - Physical Asset Accountability (property management) <P>  - Configuration Management <P>  - Asset History <P>  - Inventory Management <P>  - Acquisition Support <P>  - Workflow Management <P>  - Document Management & Forms <P>  - External system interfaces <P>  The technical approach envisioned for national ASCM embraces multi-vendor interoperability, open standards, and scalable designs that integrate client/server and web-based solutions through distributed object technology.  The FAA will achieve this vision using a distributed network-centric enterprise-wide architecture.  Architectures that fulfill these objectives are embodied in commercial off-the-shelf/non-developmental item (COTS/NDI) Enterprise Asset Management (EAM) applications available from several vendors.  <P> The FAA is planning to issue a solicitation to acquire a COTS EAM solution and systems integration support.  The successful offeror will provide the COTS solution and integration skills required for the full lifecycle support of the national ASCM program. <P> An Initial Requirements Document (iRD) was published in October 1999 (see attachment).  This document is currently being expanded and will be used as part of the Request for Offer (RFO).  In a separate but related effort defined within the iRD, the FAA Logistics Center (FAALC) is currently developing increased capabilities, referred to as the Logistics Center Support System (LCSS).  Aimed at performing as a stand-alone solution, the LCSS requirements identified in the iRD will not be part of the national ASCM solution set, other than as an interface. <P> In February 2000, the FAA conducted an Industry Day to understand the current state of EAM products and to gain insight into the applicability of these products to the FAA's asset supply chain management requirements, as defined in the national ASCM iRD.   <P> In conjunction with the Industry Day, the FAA issued a Market Survey questionnaire to vendors expressing an interest in the national ASCM program.  The information gathered as part of the responses to that questionnaire enabled the FAA to validate and verify the COTS / NDI alternative selected for the program's implementation strategy.   <P> The FAA plans to release a Screening Information Request (SIR) to industry in mid to late March 2002, seeking full and open competition, in which to develop an offerors list.  This SIR will include specific evaluation criteria to determine the experience, skills, and capabilities of prospective offerors.  The SIR will be posted on the FAA Contract Opportunities Website. <P> Following the SIR, the FAA plans to issue a Request for Offer (RFO) in early June 2002, to those offerors who have successfully satisfied the above mentioned criteria.  This RFO will include contract terms and conditions, Statement of Work (SOW), and evaluation criteria specific to the requirement.  Subsequently, qualified offerors will be required to perform Operational Capabilities Demonstrations (OCD) using scenarios developed by the FAA. <P> The FAA anticipates a Calendar Year 2002 award of a national ASCM contract for the development of a program that ties together the management and control of all assets within the FAA under one single system.  The performance period shall consist of a base year plus four separately priced option years. <P> This announcement is for information only and is not a request for proposals. The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The FAA shall not be liable for any costs associated with the preparation of responses to this public announcement, or reimburse or otherwise pay any costs incurred by any party responding to the SIR/RFO. <P>  <P> Attachments:  Initial Requirements Document Asset Supply Chain Management (ASCM) < http://www.faa.gov/ats/af/afz.htm#afz500 > <P>

N62645-02-R-0006
Amendment 002
 
Question #1:  Within the CCTV portion of the RFP, the document specifies analog VCR?s for video storage and archiving purposes.  Will the Government accept as ?equal? the use of digital video storage units if the required storage hours are met or exceeded?

Government Response:  Yes.  Digital video storage is accepted as equal.  
 
Question #2:  The Solicitation and the received Amendment refer to several requirements for the integrated security system are we to understand that these are minimum requirements?  

Government Response:  Yes.  These are minimum requirements.
 
Question #3:  Within the description portion of the RFP there is mentioned the capabilities for off-site monitoring of the Intrusion Alarms ?after hours? for dispatching security personnel.  What types of information or annunciation will be accepted at this remote location?

Government Response:  It is currently a dedicated line directly from Bldg. 38-H to NTC Security.
 
Question #4:  Are there existing functional pathways i.e.; LAN located within building 38-H?   If so, could the security / video / access control system utilize this for communication pathways?
 
Government Response:  This is not available.  Contractors will have to do their own pathway.

Question #5:  The RFP specifications for the computer system list Windows NT 4.0.  Will the Government accept Windows 2000, or Windows XP as an equal?

Government Response:  Will accept Windows 2000.  

Question #6:  Are time lapse VCR's required or can digital recorders be provided?  Digital recorders will provide more flexibility and ease of use along with easily accessed stored video.

Government Response:  Digital recorders are acceptable.

Question #7:  What frame rate is required of the video?

Government Response:  The Time Lapse Recording should have options to record from 20 frames per second to 1 frame every 10 seconds.

Question #8:  How long is storage of information required?

Government Response:  30-days storage.  

Question #9:  Are the 12 motion detectors in addition to the cameras identified?

Government Response:  Yes, we would like the 12 additional motion detectors.

Question #10:  The document specifies the use of time lapse VCR's and matrix switchers, which is old technology.  Can Digital Video Recorders (DVR's) with multiplexers be used instead?
 
Government Response:  Digital video recorders will be acceptable.
 
Question #11:  The document specifies two monitors.  Is Monitor 1 to be dedicated solely for the use of viewing  Camera 5? 

Government Response:  Yes.  We want Monitor 1 dedicated to 2nd Deck Main Entrance.  This entrance has high traffic volume and all doors lead to secured areas.  

Question #12:  Access Control:

A) While the specifications indicate that the bids are to include door hardware, in locations that already have functioning locking hardware on doors, can the existing locking hardware (primarily electric door strikes) be utilized in the new installation?  (In the walk through, almost all doors were opened by the tour guide for
complete inspection, the existing locking hardware appeared to be functioning properly)

Government Response:  Existing door hardware should be able to be used in the conversion.  The hardware is old, however, as of this writing it is functioning properly.  If, during the conversion, any hardware is determined to show excessive wear, new hardware should be installed.    

B) The existing mag stripe readers are American Magnetics Corporation.  What is the manufacturer of the panels that control the existing access control system? (This information will allow a determination of the feasibility of reusing any existing wiring)

Government Response:  The current system was designed, installed and maintained by NTC Electronics, Inc., Alsip, Illinois.

Question #13:  Please define the term ?Security System Control Panel? as used in the first portion of the specification.  Does this mean that all command and control equipment will be located in Room 204 (i.e. Access Control Computer, CCTV Matrix/Multiplexer)? 

Government Response:  Yes.  All command and control equipment will be located in Room 204.  

Question #14:  Please describe the mounting configuration desired for the command & control equipment, i.e. do you desire a console workstation?  Vertical rack?  Desktop configuration?  Ceiling mount monitors?   How much space is allocated for the equipment?

Government Response:  Vertical rack is acceptable.  Space available approximately 4 ft x 6 ft.

Question #15:  Is all existing security hardware to be replaced, or are any portions of the existing system (e.g. electric strikes) able to be integrated into the new system?

Government Response:  The response is the same as indicated in Question #12(A).      

Question #16:  Please re-clarify the reader technology desired; i.e. is your intent to specify a reader technology or to specify an entry process?  (It appears that the objective is to create a level II entry process (card plus PIN) and level I egress process (card only).  Proximity technology offers substantial operational benefits over magnetic stripe or Weigand swipe technology, and can meet the level II entry requirement of card plus PIN.)  

Government Response:  Proximity is fine provided we still have the capability to enter access codes where keypads are present.   

Question #17:  Please confirm that you desire a direct-print PVC color photo identification and access badge making process.  

Government Response:  Yes, direct-print PVC is required.  

A) Do you desire to a single-side or duplexing printer? 

Government Response:  Duplexing printer is desired.  

B) Will the badging process be performed in Room 204, or will a separate badging workstation be needed? 

Government Response:  Will be performed in Room 204.

Question #18:  Is there a strict limitation to 2 14? monitors?  (Most matrixes are limited to 16 camera inputs, requiring at least 2 monitors for display purposes, plus a control monitor.  Is this acceptable?)

Government Response:  No restriction.

Question #19:  Are you specifically excluding the use of digital video recorders in favor of time lapse analog video tape recorders?  (While slightly more expensive, a digital recording system offers substantial operational benefits.)

Government Response:  No, we are not excluding use of digital video recorders.

Question #20:  Are any door sensors (i.e. balanced magnetic switches) to be incorporated into the IDS system design, or just the motion sensors that are specified?  If yes, please identify which doors are to have sensors.

Government Response:  No door sensors.  Motion sensors as indicated.

Question #21:  The RFP states "Intrusion detection after hours shall set off an alarm at NTC".

A)  Is there a preference or requirement as to how the alarm is annunciated at NTC?

Government Response:  Use same dedicated line that is in place today.  Just switch over from current system to the new one.

B)  Does NTC have an alarm receiver that could be contacted via dial-up from NDSL?
 
Government Response:   Use dedicated line currently in place. 

C)  Could a PC be used at NTC that monitors alarm information from the control PC at NDSL?  If so, are two (2) static IP addresses availible, one for NTC and one for NDSL?

Government Response:  Dedicated line that contacts NTC Security if intrusion takes place.  

Question #22:  RFP states "The system will include equipment that can integrate color photo identification and access badge making capability".  Is the badging capability (camera, printer, and software) required now, or just the ability to integrate it at a later time?

Government Response:  Badging capability now.

Question #23:  RFP states "During an alarm event, sirens and local alarm are turned off through the software" after
hours a NTC securtiy personnel will respond. Will the NTC response personnel have access to the control PC and control software, or will another means of alarm deactivation be required?

Government Response:  Both NTC Security personnel and NDSL Great Lakes Command Duty Officer.

Question #24:  Will any area need to be armed while another area remains unarmed (i.e. arm deck 3 while deck 2
is unarmed)?

Government Response:  Yes.  Due to work schedules and potential overtime in a specific area one area must be able to be armed while another is unarmed.  

Question #25:  Is new cabling required to be installed in conduit?
 
Government Response:  Yes, conduit shall be used.    

Question #26:  Is existing Door Hardware being replaced because exiting a room does not require the use of a card?
 
Government Response:  We believe this question is similar to #12 and #15.  Existing hardware should be able to be used in the conversion.   

Question #27:  Is the stairway opposite the elevator the fire exit where motion detectors are required?
 
Government Response:  No.  There are two (2) fire exits identified.  2nd Deck fire exit is on the west side of the building in the Administration area  (next to Room 225).  3rd Deck fire exit is on the west side of the building in Room 307.  

Question #28:  Will we be required to supply a console/rack for the equipment to be installed in Room 204, or will the existing desk be used?
 
Government Response:  A console/rack for equipment will be required.  

Question #29:  What is the desired method for alarming the NTC for after-hours intrusion and the specified door alarms?  Will a simple alarm bell suffice, or would telephone notification be preferred?
 
Government Response:  Dedicated line that is currently in place.

Question #30:  Are all three sections of the proposal, and the price proposal to be submitted in a single binder, or separate binders?
 
Government Response:  All parts of the technical proposals should be submitted as a single unit.  Pricing shall be submitted separately.

Question #31:  Your modification noted that the keypads are to have swipe type readers.  Will proximity type readers be considered acceptable?
 
Government Response:  Proximity type readers would be acceptable.  

Question #32:  Are all the existing Keypads, card readers, motion detectors, and electrical hardware to be replaced, or re-used?
 
Government Response:  Out intent is to replace these items.  The existing system is quite old and with the new system we would like new items as described above.   

Question #33:  Is there asbestos present at the facility?
 
Government Response:  With the age of Bldg. 38-H you are always going to discover asbestos if you go DEEP enough into the structure.

Question #34:  Will asbestos abatement be required?
 
Government Response:  We don?t see this being a problem.  There have been other instances were cable, etc. have been run from one area to another and have we have not had to perform asbestos abatement for that process.  

Question #35:  Is the purpose of this solicitation to improve the physical security, or to expand the existing system?

Government Response:  Our intent is to improve our physical security system.  

Question #36:  What types of locking mechanisms are used on the doors that are to be controlled? Are the electric strikes or Magnetic locks?

Government Response:  The locking mechanisms are electric strikes.

Question #37:  Are all of these doors single doors or are some of them doubles?

Government Response:  There are four (4) double doors.  Secured entrance on 2nd Deck; Command Suite Glass Doors; Administration Glass Doors and the entrance to Room 307 (Laboratory) on the 3rd Deck..  The remaining ones are single doors.

Question #38:  What is the requirements for the door contacts?  Can they be surface mounted on the door or do they need to be recessed into the doors and door jams?

Government Response:  Contacts need to be recessed into doors/jams.

Question #39:  If the contacts are to be recessed into the doors and jams, what is the accessibility to be able to wire these as such?

Government Response:  The accessibility to wire will not be a problem.

Question #40:  Are there requirements for Audible sounders at each door?

Government Response:  Not at each door.  Audible sounds are requested for 2nd Deck Secured Double Doors and 3rd Deck Room 307 Double Doors. 

Question #41:  Are there any requirements for "Life Safety" request to exit devices, such as touch sense bars, crash bars or such?

Government Response:  There MUST be a way for the system to be ?turned off? when the central Fire Alarm is activated so the employees would not need to card swipe out in the event of a fire.  


The closing date for this requirement has NOT been extended and remains 3:00 EST on 20 March 2002.

<DESC>This amends USZA92-02-Q-0008, the synopsis/solicitation originally posted 20 February 2002.  This amendment extends the response date to 4:30 on 15 March 2002 and provides a response to the following contractor's questions:  Q1)  Government request continuous coverage - where is contractor to be located?  A1)  Anywhere, the location of the contractor does not matter.  Q2)  Example: the government request movement and contractor purchase tickets - how is this or any other expense related directly to medevac mission transportation reimbursed?   A2)  We are anticipating a fixed price contract to cover any medical evacuation.  Q3)  Is there an incumbent, if so who is it? A3)  There is no current contractor.  Previously, we had a contract with Travelers Emergency Network.  Q4)  What was the last months invoiced amount?  A4)  The yearly cost on the prior contract was $39,000.00/year.  Q5)  In other words what part is a fixed price and what is reimbursable since med evac is a contingency and cannot be priced out without who, what, when, and where.  A5)  We anticipate a fixed price contract, but will review and evaluate alternate proposals.  Q6)  Is this contract for a coordinator to facilitate medevac when required?  A6)  Yes/No, the contractor would be responsible to facilitate/provide for the medical evacuation.  Q7)  What communications is required to insure interoperability with 3rd SFG forces deployed? A7) An international toll free number is all that is required.  Our guys can always access a phone either directly from sight or our communication section can patch them through on a phone line.  The company will need to make international phone calls from their location.  If needed do to poor phone service to Africa we can act as a relay either through DSN phones or radio communication.  Q8)  What is the mechanism and authority to launch a medevac mission - how will it be received? A8) Either the medic on the ground will call and request an evacuation or a provider back here at Bragg will make the notification after a discussion with the medic on the ground.  All the required information will be provided during the initial phone call.  Q9)  Does the contractor have to be located at Ft Bragg?  A9)  No.  Q10)  What are the personnel requirements? A10)  We are not requiring a staff.  Q11)  Is medical personnel required to be on staff? A11)  The requirement is for medical evacuation.  You provide to us, your proposal on doing the evacuations.  Additionally, A medical provider is a good thing on their end as that provider can talk directly to the provider on the ground and make some decisions as to what services will be required.  It may help facilitate decisions.  Q12)  Does the contractor have to be FAA Part 135 certified or only the carrier used?  A12)  The carrier.  Proposals may be faxed to Karen Glass (Point of contact) at (910)432-9345.

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-MDA02-07
<RESPDATE>031502

<CONTACT>Donald Bobby, Procurement Analyst, Phone 703-695-9125, Fax 703-697-7907, Email donald.bobby@mda.osd.mil
<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency is soliciting White Papers addressing proposed acquisition approaches to meet its objectives for targets, payloads and countermeasures to support the Ballistic Missile Defense System as outlined in the following draft Statement of Objectives: 

Statement of Objectives

The Target and Countermeasures (TC) Directorate of the Missile Defense Agency is the materiel developer of all targets, payloads, and countermeasures for the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) and the BMDS Elements.  Responsibilities include assessment and organization of requirements, design, prototyping, development, procurement, validation, certification, product improvement, qualification testing, launch services and range support of a suite of targets and countermeasures that provide a realistic adversary capability challenge to the evolving layered missile defense system.  The TC Directorate shall assure that targets and countermeasures leverage available and emerging technologies from domestic and foreign sources, and that the acquisition programs are capabilities driven, employ spiral development processes, and deliver expected performance within cost and schedule at reasonable risk.  The Missile Defense Agency will therefore acquire all targets, payloads, and countermeasures (heretofore referred to as ?targets?) of the BMDS under the management of the Target and Countermeasures Directorate.

The key objectives of this acquisition program are:

?	Reduce target cycle time (from target purchase order through launch) while maintaining success--Implement proactive, system wide business and technical innovations in conjunction with Government processes necessary to compress target-on-the-pad cycle time in balance with acceptable performance risk and affordability.  

?	System level management--Establish and enforce system level management procedures over the collective span of targets execution activities. 

?	Cost containment--Manage the targets technical trade-space and cycle time advances in balance with a prioritized, time-phased investment strategy.
 
To achieve these key objectives, consideration should be given (but not limited) to:
?	Systems Engineering, Innovative Solutions and New Target Development
o	Conduct target modification, advanced concept, and new development trade studies for cycle time advantage and inventory efficiency
o	Support the target development process from capability specification generation through target validation and certification 
o	Manage interface controls 
o	Serve as a catalyst for innovation and identify opportunities to improve targets and/or development processes
o	Execute new target development efforts 

?	Provide Threat-Credible Test Articles
?	Inventory and Inventory Management and Support Services
o	Develop processes and procedures to maintain existing inventories to include aging surveillance efforts
o	Ensure timely delivery of target capability that maximizes flexibility, reduces cycle time and controls costs
o	Integrate with existing GFE Supplies 
?	Launch Services and Range Support
o	Perform hardware integration/checkout
o	Conduct launch Operations
o	Perform data collection and reporting

Interested companies capable of meeting all or part of the government's key objectives are invited to submit a not to exceed 20 page unclassified white paper outlining their recommended approach.  Novel approaches are encouraged and should include but not be limited to: innovative approaches to ?buy? cycle time; developing alliances between/among industry/government entities; cost control initiatives; and incentive arrangements that ensure rewards and risks are equitably shared between government and industry partners.  Proposed approaches should consider, but should not be constrained by, existing contracts or organizational relationships between the MDA, the Army's Space and Missile Defense Command, Huntsville, AL, and the Air Force's Space and Missile Systems Center, Albuquerque, NM.  White Papers should reflect companies' experience relevant to the above objectives.

White Papers should be addressed to Missile Defense Agency, 7100 Defense Pentagon, ATTN: Mr. Ken Rackers, Washington DC 20301-7100.  White Papers must be received no later than 30 days after publication of this synopsis.  This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal or an announcement of solicitation.  MDA anticipates hosting a series of 60-minute one-on-one discussions with firms interested in responding to this RFI during the period 25 February 2002 - 01 Mar 2002.  The one-on-one discussions will be structured to respond to written questions from individual firms.  Additional one-on-one sessions may be scheduled after receipt of and consideration of the White Papers.  To schedule a one-on-one, contact Mr. Jim Snaman at (703) 697-2357.  Costs for preparing White Papers in response to this Request for Information are not considered allowable direct costs to any contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect costs specified in FAR 31.205-18.

White papers submitted in response to this Request for Information (RFI) will be used by MDA to develop its acquisition strategy for targets, countermeasures and payloads. Submission of a proprietary white paper may render it of limited value in the development of the acquisition strategy and future contracting vehicle/s.  If you intend to include proprietary data, ensure that it is clearly marked and segregated within the body of the white paper, or included in a separate attachment. 
Contractor support personnel will be used to evaluate white papers submitted in response to this RFI. Individuals with access to proprietary data shall sign non-disclosure statements that shall be maintained on file and will not be allowed to submit white papers. Submission of white papers in response to this RFI constitutes permission to disclose information to contractor support personnel under these conditions. 
For approximate workload planning purposes, the level of flight testing conducted during any given year is dependent upon the missile defense system and element programs. Although testing cannot be predicted precisely, base planning estimates, as projected today, for the coming years are as follows: average of 12 flight tests per year ranging from 9 per year to 20 per year. The tempo of test activity is expected to increase from the level reflected in current plans.

As the base focal point for communications-computers the 96CG will use ITA2S2 to provide a full complement of Information Technology services to the AAC and associate units at Eglin AFB, FL.  The Government is considering a 10-year contract for this effort consisting of a two-year basic award and four two-year options.  Currently much of this effort is covered by the Software Engineering Support (SES) contract F08635-96-C-0017 which is a Cost-Plus-Award-Fee (CPAF) type contract. This contract is scheduled to expire 30 Sep 02. The estimated level of performance for the new contract will be approximately 250 engineering man-years per year. The government is considering a single small business set-aside award within North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541710; (size standard - 1000 people).  This will be decided after market research is completed and a final acquisition strategy is determined.  Comments regarding contract type and the proposed term are welcome.  Respondents to this market survey should identify their business size and classification with respect to the above size standard.  Foreign participation is excluded.

<DESC>SUBJ:  Sources sought for medical/surgical items This is a Market Survey and Request for Samples to locate potential sources for the standardization of various medical/surgical items.  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) desires to offer its customers, on a national basis, the best possible products and prices and to offer its contractors more opportunities within the system.  The intent of the standardization program is to establish national mandatory sources for medical/surgical items to standardize VA_s purchasing of products.  BIDS/OFFERS ARE NOT BEING SOLICITED AT THIS TIME.  A formal solicitation or request for quotations will be issued at a later date.  Companies interested in having their items evaluated for possible inclusion in the standardization process should carefully review the item descriptions listed below.  If a company can provide any of these items, SAMPLES OF ALL ITEMS AVAILABLE THAT MEET OR EXCEED THE CRITERIA PROVIDED IN THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS SHOULD BE SUBMITTED AT THIS TIME.  Additional criteria may be added (or existing criteria deleted) during the evaluation process.  If this occurs, all samples received will be evaluated equally against the revised criteria.  All samples submitted must be clearly marked with the name of the potential offeror, the product number, and the manufacturer_s name.  NOTE:  ALL SAMPLES SUBMITTED MUST BE MANUFACTURED IN A DESIGNATED COUNTRY, A CARIBBEAN BASIN COUNTRY, OR A NAFTA COUNTRY (UNITED STATES, CANADA, AND MEXICO).  THE USER GROUP WILL ONLY EVALUATE SAMPLES MANUFACTURED IN APPROVED COUNTRIES.  A LISTING OF DESIGNATED COUNTRIES AND CARIBBEAN BASIN COUNTRIES MAY BE FOUND AT THE FOLLOWING WEBSITE: http://www.arnet.gov/far/current/html/25.html#25.003.  Potential offerors must also include any corresponding detailed product literature with the samples.  Detailed product literature should include, but not be limited to, an indication of what materials the products are comprised of (e.g. latex, etc.), country of origin, and a listing of sizes, configurations, etc. available.  If detailed literature is not received with the samples, the technical evaluation panel may be unable to fully evaluate the samples and the products could be eliminated from further consideration.  If the detailed literature provided does not sufficiently address all of the listed criteria, the product may be eliminated from further consideration without further discussion. **Please send samples (number of samples required follow each product name) and corresponding detailed product literature to: Department of Veterans Affairs, Item Management Division (049A5S), ATTN:  Carl Hunter, Building 37, First Avenue - One Block North of Cermak Road (22nd Street), Hines, IL  60141.**  Companies submitting samples are also encouraged to obtain Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) contracts for those products from the respective government contract office.  VA has the option of awarding a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) against an FSS contract rather than issuing a formal solicitation for the purpose of standardization.  If VA chooses to use a BPA as the contracting method, those companies who do not have their products on an FSS contract will be eliminated from the competition.  Similarly, if VA chooses to use a BPA, VA will use the items submitted in response to this request for samples and the results of the evaluations performed on those items to determine which companies are requested to participate in the resulting Request for Quotations. The VHA Medical/Surgical User Group, a group of VA physicians, nurses and clinicians who have expertise and knowledge of the products, will review and technically evaluate any samples submitted.  VA deems the members of the User Group to be medical experts.  Therefore, they are qualified to determine which products are acceptable.   NOTE: SAMPLES FOR ANY ITEM THAT INCLUDES A REQUIREMENT THAT THE PRODUCT  MEETS A SPECIFIC STANDARD (e.g. AAMI, ASTM, etc.) MUST INCLUDE LITERATURE OR A LETTER FROM THE MANUFACTURER INDICATING HOW THE PRODUCT MEETS THE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENT. SAMPLES AND PRODUCT LITERATURE MUST BE RECEIVED NO LATER THAN APRIL 5, 2002.  Companies not submitting samples by the above date may be eliminated from consideration on any subsequent procurement action for these items.

<DESC>This is a market survey only.  It is for planning purposes only and should not be construed as a Request for Proposal.  The US Army, Office of the Project  Manager for Tank and Medium-caliber Armament Systems (OPM TMAS),  has a  requirement to field a new 25mm training round to replace the M910 25mm  training round.  This new training round will emulate service Cartridges, 25mm,  Armor Piercing Fin Stabilized Discarding Sabot with Tracer (APFSD-T), M919 and  the Cartridge, 25mm, APDS-T M791.  Qualified sources are being sought for  System Development and Demonstration (SDD) and the first 1-3 years of  production for the cartridge, 25mm, Target Practice with Tracer (TPDS-T),  M910E1.  This new training round will be fired from the 25mm M242 Autogun on  the M2/ M3 Bradley Fighting Vehicle.  The M910E1 will be required to match the  trajectory of the M919 to within 1 mil and 0.5 seconds out to a range of 2500  meters. The M910E1 will be required to match the trajectory of the M791 to  within 1 mil and 0.5 seconds out to a range of 2000 meters. The M910E1 will  have a maximum range requirement of 8000 meters.  One contract will be awarded  for the SDD phase. Contract award is anticipated in early FY03.  At the end of  the SDD phase the contractor will deliver a qualification sample necessary to  demonstrate the safety and performance characteristics of the M910E1. Elapsed  time from SDD contract award to completion of qualification will be 21 months.   TC-LRP is planned for the fourth quarter FY04. The contract may contain  production options which could be exercised if the M910E1 achieves Type  Classification-Standard and funding becomes available.  It is anticipated that  a second source will be solicited upon successful achievement of TC-LRP to  support a dual source procurement strategy for follow-on production. The  government is contemplating limiting this procurement to the domestic  industrial base (US and Canada only). Responsible, interested sources are asked  to submit their qualifications and capabilities including information, as  applicable, on potential candidate rounds, level of maturity, basic  description, basic performance information, and the amount of testing completed  to date.
