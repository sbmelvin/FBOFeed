<p>THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. This Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS) is in support of Market Research being conducted by the United States Air Force to identify sources and determine if this effort can be competitive or a Small Business Set-Aside.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is not a Request for Proposal (or solicitation) or an indication that a contractual commitment will exist for this requirement. The government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market research. No funds are available to fund the information solicited.</p>
<p>The 76<sup>th</sup> Commodities Maintenance Group (CMXG) at the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Complex (OC-ALC), located at Tinker AFB, is seeking information for automated system solutions or alternatives to the mechanical removal (abrasive media blasting) of organic finish. The objective is to eliminate personnel exposure to harmful airborne coating particles created by the aforementioned process. The Government will use this information to determine the best future acquisition strategy for this procurement, inclusive of the need to do an Industry Day and/or Presolicitation Conference.</p>
<p>The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 327910 Abrasive Product Manufacturing which has a corresponding size standard of 500 employees. The Government is interested in all businesses to include, Large Businesses, Small Businesses, Small Disadvantaged Businesses 8(a)s, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, HUBzone Businesses, and Woman-Owned Small Businesses. <span style="mso-bidi-font-family: "><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The government requests that interested parties respond to this notice if applicable and identify your small business status to the identified NAICS code.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Additionally, please provide any anticipated teaming arrangements, along with a description of similar services offered to the Government and to commercial customers for the past three years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Any responses involving teaming agreements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime, and the work accomplished by the teaming partners.</span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">II. BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p>Abrasive blasting is the process of forcibly propelling a stream of abrasive material (plastic, sand, glass, etc.) against a surface to remove paint coatings, rust/corrosion and other contaminants. It is a mechanical removal operation that is recommended when use of chemical removers is impractical due to structural complexities and/or rising difficulties in an area being worked and/or local environmental restrictions. While these methods are very effective for finish system removal, they can cause severe damage to structure and equipment in a very short time if improperly used.</p>
<p>Plastic media is currently being utilized during the abrasive blasting operation. Plastic media used has a particle size of U.S. screen 20 to 40 mesh; however, 12 to 16 mesh may be added as make up media. The media has a particle shape that is irregular with sharp, angular edges and corners. Specifically, CMXG's media blasting booths are currently utilizing Type V plastic media. Type V is an acrylic plastic with a hardness of 3.5 Mohs (46-54 Barcol) hardness. This media is authorized for use on both aerospace systems and non-aerospace applications. Blasting parameters include blasting pressure of 25-40 PSI, stand-off distance (nozzle tip to work surface) of 12-24 inches, and blasting angles of incidence (between nozzle tip and work surface) of 0-60 degrees (for Alclad and composites) and 30-90 degrees (for nonclad). Any metal calling for Type V plastic media will have a thickness of no less than 0.016 inches.</p>
<p>A constant removal rate must be maintained and the amount of time which the plastic media blast impinges on any given surface (dwell time) shall be limited. As stand-off distance increases, pressure increases, and vice versa, to maintain a constant removal rate. In addition, as the angle of incidence decreases towards 0 degrees, the pressure increases, and vice versa as the angle of incidence increases towards 90 degrees.</p>
<p>A variety of masked aircraft components (e.g. flaps, tabs, inboard and outboard ailerons, elevators, rudders, nose and side cowls, miscellaneous components) undergo the abrasive blasting process at the OC-ALC. Parts can range from 1.5 in. x 5 in. bar weight to 8 ft long x 6.5 ft OD side cowls.</p>
<p>The dust and exposure to strontium chromate [Cr(VI)]<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>and cadmium airborne particles created by abrasive blasting is hazardous to the respiratory tract and may cause major health problems. Strontium chromate is added to alloy steel to increase hardenability and corrosion resistance. It is, however, a known human carcinogen if inhaled. Additionally, it targets the respiratory system, kidneys, liver, skin and eyes. Cadmium is used in the electroplating process due to ability to resist corrosion when applied to steel components. Inhalation of cadmium dust can be dangerous and potentially fatal. Blasting operators are protected from airborne exposure with personal protection equipment along with ventilated walk-in booths. Any equipment failure may leave operators vulnerable to hex chrome or cadmium particulates and other airborne particles that are hazardous to the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract.</p>
<p>The 76 CMXG OC-ALC is seeking information for system/process solutions and innovative approaches for eliminating personnel exposure to Cr(VI) from the abrasive blasting process.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">III. REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>
<p>The 76 CMXG's priority is to remove personnel from exposure or potential exposure from hazardous materials, in this case, hexavalent chromium and cadmium airborne particulates.</p>
<p>Along with keeping the required operating conditions listed above, the most important factor in any removal of organic finish system is complete removal without damaging surfaces on which it is applied. Mechanical methods shall be used only long enough to remove the finish system and not abrade the underlying metal surface. Removal without damage to the surface or creating a condition which can lead to future corrosion damage and providing a surface suitable for finish system reapplication are the most important factors. The blasting rate shall be able to keep up with the current workflow and the process/technology shall be undamaging environmentally.</p>
<p>Dust generated from abrasive blasting can create the potential for dust explosion. Only pneumatic type motor-driven equipment shall be used. All sources of ignition shall be avoided and adequate ventilation in the area shall be provided. The resulting contamination from abrasive blasting operations makes the plastic media a hazardous waste and shall be disposed of properly.</p>
<p>The government needs industry input on the availability of existing equipment, functions, and deficiencies and recommend solutions to meet or exceed the operational, environmental, and safety requirements. There are no preset restrictions on solutions. Industry input may include any range of solution from modification of all or part of any component to complete refurbishment or replacement of the entire system. A recommended solution may be considered but not be restricted to automated or robotic abrasive blasting systems.</p>
<p>Interested parties are requested to submit any information necessary to describe the recommended solution, including recommended steps necessary to achieving the desired end result if the technology is not currently available or anything the industry wants the government to consider.</p>

<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">II. BACKGROUND</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The High Volume Low Pressure (HVLP) spray method is the standard priming and painting application method for Air Force aircraft components and most other equipment. The coating material is atomized by high volume of low pressure air through the spray gun nozzle. The HVLP spray equipment generally utilizes low pressure (below 20 PSIG) gun cups to assist in delivery of paint and primer to the gun nozzle. Low pressure air between 1-10 PSIG is used to atomize the priming or topcoat material at the spray head. A high volume of air is used to push the priming or topcoat material and form a very soft, low-velocity pattern. This soft spray generally dispenses more consistent coverage and a finer overall finish. The HVLP guns are held closer to the surface (6-10 inches) than a conventional air spray gun due to the lower speed of the priming particles. The film thickness produced in a single coat is often greater than that of conventional air spray systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">A variety of masked aircraft components (e.g. flaps, tabs, inboard and outboard ailerons, elevators, rudders, radomes,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>nose and side cowls, doors, miscellaneous components) undergo the priming and painting process at the OC-ALC. Parts can range from &frac12; in. diameter washers to 8.75 ft x 32 ft flaps. The most common component measures 6 ft x 8.75 ft. Most aerospace parts are made from aluminum sheet metal, aluminum alloy, steel, and composite materials. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Two primers are primarily used, AkzoNobel 10P20-13 (MIL-PRF23377) and Deft 02Y040A (MIL-PRF-23377J). Both are two-components, high solids, epoxy primers. The AkzoNobel primer requires a 3-part base (10P20-13) followed by a 1-part curing solution (EC-213). The Deft primer requires a 3-part base (02Y040A) followed by a 1-part catalyst (2GN070A). Both primers are required to be applied at 59-95&deg;F (15-35&deg;C) and 35-75% relative humidity.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The two primarily used topcoats are AkzoNobel 03GY330 (MIL-PRF-85285E) and Deft 99GY001 (MIL-PRF-85285E).

Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) intends to solicit a sole source, firm-fixed price, contract for the Biological Select Agents and Toxins (BSAT) Database for Department of Defense (DoD) facilities. The proposed contract action is required by The Office of the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Nuclear, Chemical, and Biological Defense/Chemical and Biological Defense, OASD (NCB/CB). <br>  <br> This action is supported by the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 (only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements). <br>  <br> The proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, Battelle Memorial Institute (Cage Code 79986), under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(16)(ii), all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. <br>  <br> The BSAT database will maintain a qualitative BSAT inventory for OSD and Service headquarters and a quantitative database for BSAT registered entities. Development and refinement was completed in the Phase I Qualitative portion of the database, which was developed by Battelle starting in June 2011. Market research indicates that Battelle is the only qualified contractor at this time that can meet the requirements for the DoD BSAT database due to exclusive knowledge of the Select Agent Program (SAP) and the ability to obtain a Security Risk Assessment from the SAP.  <br>  <br> The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541712 and the size standard is 500 employees. <br>  <br> For further information please contact Ms. Jennifer Davies, Jennifer.i.davies.civ@mail.mil.   <br>

<a href="mailto:theresa.i.boutchyard.civ@mail.mil">DLA Aberdeen (ACC-APG)</a>
<DESC>DLA Land Aberdeen is soliciting for proposals for the procurement/fabrication of (Removable) self-contained Canopy Kits, NSN 4940-00-937-2553, CW-924/G, PPL #10482. <br>  <br> This removable canopy is used to cover/shroud a tactical assemblage that is housed inside a S-280 Shelter. The S-280 Shelter is approximately 12'X6'X7' and is normally transported on a 2 1/2 or 5 ton vehicle. The removable canopy provides a sun shield to the exterior roof/sides of the shelter when military units are deployed in locations of extreme high temperatures. It keeps the direct rays of the sun from contacting the aluminum skin surface of the shelter, thereby allowing the air conditioners to efficiently maintain the shelter interior temperature at an acceptable range for soldier operation/performance. The technical data package for this kit is specified/described via fully-detailed drawings. This kit is comprised of several (corner/side) aluminum bracket assemblies (which can either be welded together or these components may be casted instead), lanyard assemblies, rivnuts, screws, washers, sealant, and the 3-piece canopy which is cloth-laminated, vinyl-nylon high strength material. One side of each canopy is a  quote mark GREEN 383 quote mark  color, and the reverse side is  quote mark TAN 686 quote mark  color, to allow the canopy to match the camouflage color scheme of the deployed environment.  <br>  <br> You are not required to install any rivnuts on shelters, the rivnut installation drawings contained in the technical data package are provided for the installer of the Canopy Kit, as I said, which will be soldiers in a General/Direct Support Shop, or installation will be performed at a depot.  These rivnut installation drawings are  quote mark not quote mark  for you (the bidder/contractor) to install. <br>  <br> This contract action is to be a 5 year, firm fixed price (FFP), Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.  The estimated annual demand for the item is 100 units/year.  The proposed action is expected to be a 100% small-business set-aside.  Multiple contracts may be awarded.  Contract ceiling for any/all awards combined would be $1,600,000. <br>  <br> It is anticipated that the solicitation will be released on or about November 6, 2014 with proposals due approximately 30 days later. <br>  <br> All parties interested in doing business with Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance) (ACC - APG (C4ISR)) and DLA Land at Aberdeen are invited to access the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) at https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi?ASFI_FAQ.cfm.

<DESC><strong>INTRODUCTION<br /></strong>This is a pre-solicitation non-competitive (notice of intent) synopsis to award a contract without providing for full or open competition (including brand-name). THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. <br /><br />The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Consolidated Station Support and Simplified Acquisitions (CSS/SA) Branch intends to negotiate and award a purchase order to University of Vermont &amp; State Agricultrural College (UVM) for utilization of an analytic approach involving an evolutionary algorithm developed by UVM without providing for full and open competition (including brand-name).
<p><strong>NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE<br /></strong>The intended procurement is classified under NAICS code 541712 with a Size Standard of 500 Employees.</p>
<p><strong>REGULATORY AUTHORITY <br /></strong>The resultant contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-76 dated July 25, 2014.</p>
<p>This acquisition is for a commercial item or service and is conducted under the procedures as prescribed in FAR subpart 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This acquisition is NOT expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.</p>
<p><strong>STATUTORY AUTHORITY <br /></strong>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the authority of FAR Subpart 13.106-1.</p>
<p><strong>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT </strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose and Objectives<br /></span>The purpose of this contract is to utilize the University of Vermont's (UVM) analytic approach capable of capturing intra- and inter-domain nonlinear interactions Intramural Research Program (IRP) of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Neuroimaging Research Branch (NRB) in order to label interactions among neural, genetic, and phenotypic characteristics that are associated with drug use, nicotine consumption in particular.  The UVM Complex Systems group has reported an analytic approach involving an evolutionary algorithm called genetic programming (GP) capable of capturing these intra- and inter-domain nonlinear interactions.  Preparation and application of this methodology to NRB data, under the guidance of Dr. Stein, is required. This would be of high value for the NIDA Intramural Research Program as our datasets are typically high-dimensional and multi-domain and likely contain numerous nonlinearities (e.g., inter-regional brain interactions; gene x environment interactions).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Period of Performance<br /></span>The period of performance shall be for one (1) year after receipt of order.<br /> <br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Project Description<br /></span>The Contractor shall apply this unique analytic method to address the following:</p>
<p>(1)	The Contractor shall determine if these biomarkers for smoking are within the resting state functional connectome (i.e., patterns of resting state neural interaction) associated with nicotine use. The Contractor shall determine if any of these interactions confer insight from a clinical or physiological perspective.</p>
<p>(2)	The Contractor shall determine if cross-domain interactions exist (e.g., gene-brain) that are associated with nicotine use.</p>
<p>(3)	The Contractor shall determine if any associations from (1) or (2) allow for spectrum or categorical classification, rather than just binary classification of smokers.</p>
<p>Prepared analysis techniques shall be standardized and the Contractor shall provide training for NRB staff in the use of these algorithms.  At the conclusion of the contract period NIDA researchers shall be capable of conducting analyses employing this methodology independently.</p>
<p><strong>CONTRACTING WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME) DETERMINATION</strong><br />The determination by the Government to award a contract without providing for full and open competition is based upon the market research conducted. Specifically, only the University of Vermont &amp; State Agricultrural College (UVM) is capable of meeting the needs of this requirement due to the unique methods previously developed by UVM.  The Complex Systems group under Dr. Garavan's supervision at UVM provides the unique expertise required for the implementation of the proposed computational methodology.  No other group has employed genetic programming (GP) in the analysis of fMRI.  Their methodology is capable of capturing these intra- and inter-domain nonlinear interactions needed for the analysis required by the NRB. The UVM group has applied GP to define hierarchical network structure in the resting state, adolescent brain.  Results of that study, which were presented at the 2014 OHBM conference in Hamburg, Germany (Allgaier et al., 2014) suggested likely differences (some nonlinear) in resting state functional connectome between teenagers who consume alcohol and those who don't within the IMAGEN dataset.  The data captured using this methodology will be of high value for the NIDA Intramural Research Program as the datasets are typically high-dimensional and multi-domain and likely contain numerous nonlinearities (e.g., inter-regional brain interactions; gene x environment interactions).</p>
<p>The intended source is:</p>
<p>University of Vermont &amp; State Agricultrural College (UVM) <br />85 S. Prospect Street<br />Burlington, VT 05405</p>
<p><strong>CLOSING STATEMENT<br /></strong>THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this notice.  Responses to this notice shall contain sufficient information to establish the interested parties' bona-fide capabilities for fulfilling the requirement and include: unit price, list price, shipping and handling costs, the delivery period after contract award, the prompt payment discount terms, the F.O.B. Point (Destination or Origin), the Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number (DUNS), the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and the certification of business size. All offerors must have an active registration in the System for Award Management (SAM) www.sam.gov."</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The information received will normally be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to proceed on a non-competitive basis or to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>All responses must be received by the closing date and time of this announcement and must reference the solicitation number.  Responses may be submitted electronically to Megan Ault, Contract Specialist, at megan.ault@nih.gov. US Mail and Fax responses will not be accepted.</p>

OBSSR's plan includes facilitating: a) the next generation of basic behavioral and social sciences research: b) collaborative research across the full range of disciplines to elucidate the complex determinants of health and health systems challenges; and c) the translation, implementation, dissemination, and maintenance of best practices to strengthen the sciences of dissemination, put what is known into widespread practice, reduce the burden of chronic disease and help eliminate inequities in health and health care.</p>
<p>The purpose of this requirement is to produce a publication for the scientific community on a topic of key interest to OBSSR, the NIH program staff, the NIH investigator community, and to health researchers, practitioners, and policy makers. Specifically, the special supplement will contain articles on methodology, assessment, treatment and dissemination research related to electronic and mobile health technologies. For the past several years OBSSR has been engaged in the development of activities and events designed to promote awareness of such methods and to provide education on their use. OBSSR has also been a leader in stimulating their use by NIH investigators in their behavioral and social science research projects by providing several funding opportunities in this area.</p>
<p>The proposed supplement will provide a unique opportunity to showcase work in this evolving field, and depending on the manuscripts submitted, may feature work from grantees of the NIH ICs as well as other NIH investigators. The proposal is for approximately 12 full length articles related to methodology, assessment, treatment and dissemination research focused on electronic and mobile health technologies.</p>
<p>The content of the supplement will depend to a large extent on the content of the manuscripts submitted to the Call For Papers to the specials issue. Specific topics of interest to the NIH include, but are not limited to: <br />&bull; Aging (including macroeconomic impact of population aging, social and economic behaviors in aging, and psychosocial stress, health and aging)<br />&bull; Arthritis<br />&bull; Asthma<br />&bull; Cancer<br />&bull; Cardiovascular disease<br />&bull; Child and maternal health<br />&bull; Chronic disease<br />&bull; Climate change and health<br />&bull; Developmental issues over the life course<br />&bull; Dietary behavior<br />&bull; Diabetes<br />&bull; Environment (including the behavioral and social and physical environment)<br />&bull; Health disparities<br />&bull; Health equity<br />&bull; Health services<br />&bull; HIV/AIDS<br />&bull; Hypertension<br />&bull; Infectious disease<br />&bull; Injury<br />&bull; Mental health<br />&bull; Oral Health<br />&bull; Overweight and obesity<br />&bull; Physical activity<br />&bull; Population health<br />&bull; Race, Ethnicity and Socioeconomic Status (SES) relation to health and morbidity across the life course<br />&bull; Social determinants of health<br />&bull; Social Insurance Systems<br />&bull; Substance use (including alcohol and other substances)<br />&bull; Tobacco use<br />&bull; Vaccination policy and/or behavior</p>
<p>The Guest Editors will review what is submitted and determine (following peer review) which ones will be selected for inclusion in the special issue. In addition to full length papers, we anticipate there may be an overview commentary written by the Guest Editors. The main goal of the publication will be to showcase the work of the contributors, to indicate to the scientific community NIH's interest in supporting work in this area, and to alert the community that the journal Health Psychology is a journal that encourages manuscripts in this area. This special issue is critical, given the growing interest at NIH and among the investigator community in use of eHealth and mHealth methods and the need for publication outlets for this work among the public health community.</p>
<p>Purpose/Objective: <br />The purpose of this requirement is to obtain the professional services of a Contractor to assist the OBSSR in the planning and production of a Special Issue on "eHealth and mHealth: Methodology, Assessment, Treatment, and Dissemination Studies in the journal Health Psychology. This requirement will provide up to 150 pages, including copyediting and typesetting services, as well as a print run for 100 print copies of the special issue for distribution to OBSSR, guest editors, authors, and archival/promotional purposes.</p>
<p>Contractor Tasks:<br />&#9679; The Contractor shall select and coordinate with the Guest Editors who shall receive initial submissions as part of the peer review process. The Guest Editors shall determine which submissions are considered appropriate for the issue, and shall send those manuscripts out for scientific peer review regarding appropriateness and scientific rigor of the submitted articles. The Guest Editors shall evaluate the external reviews and make the final selection of manuscripts for inclusion in the special issue.<br />&#9679; The Contractor shall coordinate the submissions of any potential commentary pieces as specified by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) and Guest Editor, including review by the Guest Editors. All activities shall occur in consultation with the Guest Editors of the special issue and in cooperation with the American Psychological Association (APA), the journal's official publisher. <br />&#9679; The Contractor shall provide open access to the full supplement on the APA website.<br />&#9679; The Contractor shall attribute proper acknowledgment of NIH OBSSR sponsorship for the eHealth and mHealth special issue of Health Psychology in the final published version. This acknowledgement shall be displayed in both the print and online versions of the issue. The following language shall be used: "This 2015 special supplemental issue of Health Psychology is supported by funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR) to support the dissemination of research on eHealth and mHealth interventions, methods, and implications in the practice of health psychology."</p>
<p>Reference to NIH or any of its Institutes and Centers (ICs) or components, as well as use of Government names, symbols, logos, and other identifying marks, shall not be used for endorsement or implied endorsement of any non-NIH entity, product or service.</p>
<p>Contract Deliverables: <br />The Contractor shall provide the following deliverables:</p>
<p>1. Provide electronic versions of penultimate papers to the COR and commentary authors by July 1, 2015.<br />2. Submit the final electronic draft versions of issue to the COR for final review on or before August 15, 2015.<br />3.

Provide open access to the full supplement on the APA website. Provide information so that OBSSR and the participating NIH ICs can establish a link from their website to the APA site, where anyone can download the PDFs.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: The period of performance shall be a Base Period of twelve (12) months from Date of Award.</p>
<p>Place of Performance: The work to be performed under this contract shall be performed at the Contractor's facility. The Contractor shall be available by phone, fax and e-mail during normal business hours.</p>
<p>Program Management and Control Requirements:<br />The OBSSR COR will exercise management control over the project, communicate with the Contractor, and audit progress of journal supplement preparation. Telephone and e-mail conversation as well as in person meetings between OBSSR staff and Vendor are expected to identify unanticipated issues that will be documented and resolved.</p>
<p>Inspection and Acceptance Requirements:<br />The OBSSR COR will review all documents produced during the performance period, provide feedback to the Contractor, and determine acceptability of progress updates and final reports. The OBSSR COR will approve payment the Contractor upon completion and approval of the deliverable(s) and invoice(s).</p>
<p><br />Sole Source Justification:<br />The American Psychological Association (APA) is the professional organization that owns and manages the journal Health Psychology. APA is the publisher of the peer-reviewed academic journal in which the special section will be published. Through its publications the APA explores social and behavioral issues as they affect health. The journal Health Psychology publishes peer-reviewed articles and topics devoted to public health, social science, psychological factors, behavior and physical health and illness and medicine. The journal provides empirical research, case studies, program evaluations, literature reviews, and discussions of theories of health behavior and health status, as well as research methods to investigate social and behavioral health issues. APA publications are essential resources for behavioral scientists, community organizers, government agencies, health care educators, health care facilities hospital administrators, HMO/managed care representatives, insurance company administrators, nurses, physicians, public health and community planners, social scientists, and social workers. APA publishes journals that are disseminated to more than 80,000 APA members, as well as institutions and libraries.</p>
<p>For the aforementioned reasons, APA is uniquely qualified to perform this work. Because APA manages and publishes the research journal Health Psychology, which is specific to the special supplemental journal issue research topic, it is uniquely positioned and qualified to implement this project as the organization is in alignment with the NIH/OBSSR's endeavors to help span behavioral and social science research by expanding the knowledge and understanding of eHealth and mHealth. Currently, there is no other publisher or journal that is offering a special issue on this specific topic covering eHealth and mHealth, specifically methodology, assessment, treatment, and dissemination research.</p>
<p>Any efforts to identify the required skills and expertise through outside sources would pose additional undo costs to the government. Therefore, it would be in the best interest of the government to award the contract to the proposed vendor because of its unique ability to perform these tasks in a cost-efficient and timely manner.</p>

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) solicitation for USAID/INDONESIA - US-Indonesia Partnership for SOUTH-SOUTH AND TRIANGULAR COOPERATION Component (USIP-1). The overall goal of USIP 1 is that, at the end of four years, USAID assistance will have developed the capacity of GOI to provide more effective and strategic development cooperation. Key indicators that USAID will use to measure the results of the program are: 1) Number of milestones reached to advance SSTC with USG assistance; 2) Score on the Institutional Capacity Assessment tool for NCT; 3) Percentage of GOI ministries reporting outgoing development cooperation to the National Coordination Team or designated GOI body; and 4) Increase in percentage of investment leveraged from private and public sources for the GOI-USG SSTC program. By the end of the project, it is expected that there will be clear operating procedures for a consolidated unit reporting outgoing development cooperation, including outgoing development cooperation financial contributions and results, provided through GOI's SSTC. This unit will be able to collect data, analyze it, and report on its implications. It is also expected that SSTC and triangular projects will improve in quality and become more sustainable. The measurements of improvement will look at the project design cycle and planning process, based on USAID-GOI mutually agreed upon criteria. USIP 1 seeks three Outputs: 1) SSTC framework and intra-government coordination by GOI strengthened by increasing the capacity of the National Coordination Team and implementing technical line ministries and improving the inclusiveness of SSTC stakeholders in Indonesia; 2) Support for triangular cooperation increased to expand a scope and sustainability of triangular cooperation pilot activities and percentage of co-investment; and 3) Learning and knowledge management in SSTC advanced through increased collaboration between USAID, GOI, and partners (traditional and emerging development partners, civil society, think tanks, academia, private sector etc.) to conduct Collaborating, Learning, and Adapting (CLA) activities to advance the knowledge around SSTC and continue to adapt programming based on learning results.
<p>Accordingly, this solicitation intends to limit to legal-local Indonesia organization only. USAID anticipates awarding a Cost-Reimbursement completion type contract, with a total estimated cost not to exceed $4 million. The contract period is comprised of a basic period of four years.</p>
<p>USAID intends to issue a full and open RFP on/or about 15 days from the posting of this notice.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District will be issuing a <br> solicitation set aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business <br> (SDVOSB) for Invitation for Bid (IFB) for Barnes Building Roof Repairs in <br> Boston, MA. This was previously pre-solicited against solicitation number W912Wj-14-B-0009 which has expired/is archived and unavailable. <br>  <br> The NAICS code for this procurement is 238160.  <br>  <br> The estimated construction cost is between $100,000 and $500,000.00. The project is <br> planned to be issued on or about April 2014. <br>  <br> The building is a 58,000 square foot, 10-story office building in a dense urban area exposed to coastal storms and high winds. The existing roofing system is <br> a fully adhered Ethylene-Propylene-Diene-Monomer (EPDM) system which has been damaged during recent storm events, including Hurricane Sandy. Damages include partial separation of the EPDM from insulation substrates, partial separation of the EPDM from the perimeter parapet wall, water penetration below the EPDM into insulation layers, and other damages and general age deterioration. High wind events have caused the EPDM to balloon over large areas of the roof, worsening existing deterioration, and threatening to completely separate the EPDM from substrate material,creating a potential hazard in adjacent areas. <br>  <br> Specific work tasks are intended to reconstruct severely deteriorated areas of <br> the roof and to secure the remaining existing EPDM and substrate materials in <br> place. These tasks include: full depth roof repair (new insulation and EPDM) <br> in limited areas (approximately 1250 SF), reattachment of the EPDM to the <br> perimeter parapet wall, caulking, and installing a sandbag ballast and wrap <br> and tie system at selected locations on the roof. <br>  <br> The logistics are a consideration for this project since it is located in the city of Boston. Traffic control and pedestrian traffic control will be necessary, with the possibility of shutdown of the street. The building has limited access for large <br> equipment on multiple sides of the building. The building is adjacent with another large high-rise building which is separated by a narrow alley. The building and adjacent parking lots will be occupied during the construction contract. A staging area adjacent to the building will be made available to the Contractor. <br>  <br> This is not a request for proposals at this time. The solicitation requirements <br> and contract documents to include instructions for submission and the <br> response date will be available on or about February 2015. Neither telephonic, <br> mailed nor faxed requests for hard copies of this solicitation will be accepted. <br> The solicitation will only be available online; in order to download the solicitation, offerors must access the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.fbo.gov). All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the New England District. Additional questions may be emailed to the Contract Specialist at douglas.r.raney@usace.army.mil.

The contractor must be aware that when a Saturday is scheduled, if an emergency arises (at any time during the day ) the steam will be turned back on with in one (1) hour so any piping needs to be secured and capped.
It will be the contractor's responsibility to size each sterilizer by BTU and install the required filter.

<p>The Air Force Installation Contracting Agency (AFICA) is requesting information and conducting market research to determine the capabilities of manufactures to produce and/or provide Airmen Protective Systems in an Air Force wide strategic sourcing initiative throughout the Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS). This Request for Information (RFI) is issued as a method of market research in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 52.215-3, this RFI does not constitute, nor should it be construed as, a solicitation, Request for Proposal, Request for Quotation, Invitation for Bid, or any other commitment by the Government.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI, nor will the Government provide compensation for providing information. There is no solicitation available at this time; requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. Responses are not offers, and the Government is not under any obligation to award a contract. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. If the Government decides to establish a contract for Airmen Protective Systems, it will issue a Request for Proposal at a later date. Please monitor the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.fbo.gov) for future information regarding this potential requirement.</p>
<p>Respondents are also advised that submitting any information provides the Government express permission for the Government to use the data, pictures, and other information contained in the submittals for Government purposes. The Government intends to receive electronic responses to this RFI and no mailed paper responses will be accepted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All information received in response to this RFI marked as "proprietary" will be handled accordingly. Information provided as a response to this RFI will not be returned.</p>
<p>Small Businesses are encouraged to provide a complete and thorough response to this RFI, in order to assist AFICA in determining levels of competition available in the industry, as well as helping to establish a basis for developing any subsequent potential subcontract plan goal percentages. However, not responding will not preclude participation should a solicitation be released.</p>
<p>2. DEFINITIONS</p>
<p>"Airmen Protective Systems (APS)" includes, but is not limited to the following products as listed on Attachments 2 through 8. This includes the two purchase description documents, two salient characteristic documents, and three additional documents to be referenced as needed.</p>
<p>3. PURPOSE</p>
<p>APS products are required throughout the Air Force, to include CONUS and OCONUS locales. The purpose of this strategic sourcing initiative is to consolidate and standardize the APS product requirements throughout the Air Force.</p>
<p>The purpose of publicizing this RFI notice is to communicate the strategic sourcing initiative to the industry. The Government intends to use information accumulated from these interactions to aid in the development of the potential AFICA APS acquisition strategy, identify commercial best practices, increase competition to broaden industry participation in meeting Government requirements, and gather information for planning purposes about the APS product market or capabilities, as defined in FAR 15.201(e).</p>
<p>All businesses who believe they are capable of meeting all requirements laid out in this RFI are invited to provide a response to this RFI. The input will assist in determining the interest, capability, and capacity of all potential offers.</p>
<p>4. MARKET RESEARCH SURVEY</p>
<p>The basis for this RFI is the attached survey, Attachment 1 Protected APS RFI 15 Apr 15 Final Dealer Survey, located in this posting.</p>
<p>Please refer to Attachments 2 through 8 to complete this survey. This includes the two purchase description documents, two salient characteristic documents, and three additional documents to be referenced as needed.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or issues with the survey, please email primary point of contact, <a href="mailto:tiffany.schmuker@us.af.mil">tiffany.schmuker@us.af.mil</a><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>; or secondary point of contact, <a href="mailto:mutayam.rabadi@us.af.mil">mutayam.rabadi@us.af.mil</a> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>for assistance.</p>
<p>5. EVALUATION</p>
<p>Responses will not be evaluated, but are for the purpose of gathering information to help refine our requirements and acquisition strategy. Following your response to this survey, USAF representatives may choose to engage in additional communications with selected respondents. Such communications would only be intended to support USAF market research by obtaining further clarification of the capabilities of the industry to meet requirements.</p>

Any responses involving teaming agreements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime and the work that will be accomplished by the teaming partners.</p>
<p>LtHMS is a web-based computer information/analysis tool that combines maintenance and supply information available from existing legacy systems into a single interface. It is a module of the Joint Reliability and Maintainability System (JRAMS) that was originally developed for Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) in 1998 to provide reliability, maintainability, and supportability data, along with analysis tools in one package. As presently fielded, LtHMS consists of ten assessment tools including 1) Query Wizard (web-based guided query for weapon system information); 2) Automated Trigger Based Item Management (using Statistical Process Control to identify potential problem areas); 3) System Explorer (using Work Unit Codes (WUCs) as the discriminator to obtain data from the database); 4) an Automated Reports Generator; 5) Altimeter Data Viewer (analysis of aircraft altimeter accuracy); 6) Topcoat Inspection Manager (provides data collection, analysis, and reporting for topcoat inspection data); 7) Maintenance Process Analyzer (provides visual analysis of aircraft status and associated maintenance activity); 8) Fleet and Work Unit Code Dashboards; 9) Aircraft Availability Assessment Model; and 10) Flight Data Recorder Sensor Analyzer (provides verification of aircraft sensors).</p>

<DESC>Request for Information/Market Survey <br>  <br> Corrosion Protection for Preservative Oils <br>  <br> DESCRIPTION OF INTENT:  <br> THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI), A MARKET SURVEY REQUEST IN SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING STUDY. No contract will be awarded from this announcement. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation, nor is it a request seeking Offerors to be placed on a solicitation mailing list. Response to this survey is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this market survey and any follow-up information requests. No solicitation document exists at this time, and calls requesting a solicitation will not be answered. <br>  <br> STUDY: <br> The U.S. Army Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) is conducting a market survey to identify the current and future corrosion protection abilities of preservative oils complying with either MIL-PRF-32033 and/or MIL-PRF-3150. The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) has requested the Army to increase the corrosion protection properties of MIL-PRF-32033 products due to the cost of daily maintenance needed to prevent corrosion in Navy components. Together, the Army and Navy have been conducting testing and developing potential formulations that comply with the current MIL-PRF-32033 specification requirements, as well as, additional corrosion protection target requirements.  <br>  <br> The Navy has requested the modification of MIL-PRF-32033 to include the salt spray test (ASTM B117), as listed in MIL-PRF-3150 with an additional metal coupon.  The Army has an interest in increasing the corrosion protection capabilities of fluids meeting either specification for greater applicability, reduction in maintenance, and expanded use. It is critical to identify the wide variety of preservative oils available on the market.  Information on products in development that could be classified as preservative oils would be welcome. The intent of the market survey is to identify the potential to meet the new corrosion protection targets; while still meeting the current specification requirements.   <br>  <br> These lubricant products may be commercially available or under development but with the potential to meet the military specifications mentioned above and increase corrosion protection as follows: <br>  <br> Target Corrosion Requirements, days: <br> 	Salt Spray (ASTM B117)  <br> 	Steel - 5 minimum <br> 	Aluminum - 20 minimum <br>  <br> For reference, the corrosion protection requirements listed in MIL-PRF-3150 are as follows: <br>  <br> 3.5.2 Salt-spray resistance. When tested as specified in paragraph 4.5.2, the oil, when applied to three test panels, shall provide salt-spray resistance so that not more than three corrosion dots, of which, the lengths, widths, or diameters are not greater than one millimeter after 48 hours exposure to a spray of 5% salt solution or the oil fails to pass. The total of such corrosion dots on all three test panels shall not exceed nine or the oil fails to pass. Corrosion on the outer 6 mm of the panels shall not be cause for rejection (see 4.5.2). <br>  <br> 4.5.2 Salt-spray resistance. Prepare the test panels by cleaning and sand-blasting as specified in ASTM D1748. Immerse the panels in the test oil for one minute with mild agitation and drain them for 2 hours  10 minutes at 24   3  C. Expose the panels for 48 hours to a spray of 5% salt (NaCl) solution as specified in ASTM B117. The panels shall be supported 10-20  angle from vertical with the 4 inch edge with the two holes facing down during exposure to the salt spray. Adjust the fog-collection rate to 0.75 to 2.0 ml per hour. At the completion of the exposure period, rinse the panels first in water, then in methanol as specified in D1152, and clean them by immersion in hexanes. Finally, rinse the panels in methanol and examine them to determine conformance to 3.5.2. <br>  <br> Additionally, copies of the military specifications can be downloaded at http://quicksearch.dla.mil/. <br>  <br> MARKET SURVEY QUESTIONS: <br> Part I.

<DESC>In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, the Department of Energy (DOE), National Energy Technical Laboratory (NETL) intends to award a purchase order on a sole source basis to LIGHTSPEED NETWORKS, INC (LSN) to purchase 100 Mb Point-to-Point Ethernet (ELINE) service from NETL Albany, OR to Oregon State University (OSU) Corvallis, OR.  While other vendors may be able to provide such a service, to do so would require that they build a fiber infrastructure between the two sites. Therefore, this is considered a sole source to LSN because, to the best of the NETL?s knowledge, utilizing another provider would potentially involve significant expense to NETL in order to duplicate the fiber infrastructure that LSN already has in place.  No known potential alternate sources exist which could satisfy NETL?s requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for quote/proposal.  Any interested party that believes it is capable of meeting the NETL requirement described herein may identify themselves and must provide evidence of their capability to fulfill the requirement being requested by 4:30 PM ET on May 05, 2015.  Responses must be submitted in writing to Kathleen.nedzesky@netl.doe.gov no later than the time and date noted above. Telephone responses and requests will not be received. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<SUBJECT>Aptamer-Based Bacterial Filter Development
<SOLNBR>1147130
<RESPDATE>042715
<CONTACT>Crystal G. McCoskey, Phone 8705437267, Email crystal.mccoskey@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY <br />NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR SOLICITATION
<p>This is a sources sought to determine the availability and capability of small businesses to provide services for development of an aptamer-based bacterial filter suitable for decontaminating platelet concentrates. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is&#8208; 541990 All Other Professional, Scientific and Technical Services; Small Business Size Standard is $15.0 million.</p>
<p>Section I: Requirements</p>
<p>Part I: Background</p>
<p>In the United States, at least 100 reported cases of mortality or severe morbidity are attributed to bacterial contamination of transfused Platelet Concentrates (PC) each year and more cases are certainly underreported. Bacterial detection technologies are currently used to reduce the risk of transfusion-transmitted sepsis. A limitation of these technologies is that units contaminated with small numbers of bacteria are often missed; such units can cause sepsis in immunocompromised recipients. Thus, current bacterial detection is not sufficient to ensure maximum safety of PC, and alternative approaches are desirable. Based on this, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) has a requirement for development of a filter that removes bacteria from a PC unit, thereby rendering the unit safer to transfuse. The required device shall be a membrane-based filter containing bacteria-specific affinity ligands. The main advantage of bacterial filters, would be to remove bacteria even when present in PC in undetectable numbers. The goal of this project is to establish proof of concept for such a device. This device will improve the safety of platelet transfusions and enhance public health.</p>
<p>Early work conducted by FDA personnel using peptide ligands showed that some peptides bound to bacteria with strong affinity in saline suspension but under physiological conditions in which bacteria were mixed with platelets the peptides bound poorly. These results suggested that higher affinity between the ligand and the bacteria cell was needed. After a literature search, the FDA concluded DNA aptamers might be better ligands. DNA aptamers are oligonucleotide structures that, in theory, should offer more selective and higher-affinity binding to bacterial cells than peptides. Aptamers that bind bacteria are selected from randomly generated aptamer libraries.</p>
<p>Based on the aforementioned, CBER has a need for screening of aptamer libraries for binders of three bacteria: S. epidermidis, S. aureus, and E. coli. The screening selection is expected to be conducted in the presence of platelet concentrates. During the screening process, steps have to be introduced to remove non-specific aptamers and aptamers that bind plasma proteins or platelets. The process of selection must be one-step and take no longer than one (1) week for the three bacteria due to the time sensitivity and constraints of the research project. Once the FDA receives the aptamer pools from the Contractor, the cloning and sequencing will be conducted. Afterwards the sequencing information will be provided to the Contractor for ranking of the aptamers based on predicted thermostability. It is expected the Contractor will be able to identify the aptamer sequence of the two (2) best candidates per each bacteria based on the sequencing provided.</p>
<p><br />Part II: Requirements<br />A. Scope</p>
<p>The contract shall conduct aptamer selection against three (3) bacteria S. epidermidis, S. aureus, and E. coli. using a selection method that involves only a one-step protocol. The contractor shall provide the three bacterial strains. The aptamer pools shall have been screened in the presence of platelets, and those aptamers that bind plasma proteins and platelets shall be removed. The contractor shall send the aptamer pools to FDA no later than three (3) months after the date of award. Each pool shall contain at least two (2) and up to 200 aptamer sequences. The FDA will provide the Contractor with the sequencing of all or some aptamers in the pools within six (6) months of receipt of the aptamer pools. Once the sequencing is provided, the Contractor shall conduct thermodynamic stability testing to identify consensus sequences among those aptamers identified in the pools. The contractor shall rank aptamers based on an algorithm for predicted thermostability. Within three (3) months after receipt of the sequencing from the FDA, the Contractor shall run the algorithm and provide the sequences of the top two (2) aptamers with the highest affinity to each of the three (3) bacteria strains.</p>
<p>B. Deliverables</p>
<p>i) Contractor shall deliver at least 0.5 ml each of three (3) pools of aptamers within three (3) months after contract award with each pool composed by two to maximum 200 aptamers that have been selected by screening against plasma proteins and platelets for binding S. epidermidis, S. aureus, and E. coli. <br />ii) Contractor shall provide a ranking of the aptamers based on predicted thermostability to FDA and provide the best two (2) sequences for each bacterial strain tested within three (3) months of the receipt of the sequencing from the FDA. <br />Additionally, the Contractor shall provide rationale for the selection of the two (2) best aptamers.<br />iii) Contract shall provide monthly progress reports during development of the aptamers and the ranking processes.</p>
<p>C. Delivery</p>
<p>10903 New Hampshire Avenue <br />Building 52/72, room 4336<br />Silver Spring, MD 20993</p>
<p>D. Period of performance</p>
<p>All three (3) aptamer pools shall be provided to the FDA within three (3) months of contract award. The FDA will provide the sequencing within six (6) months of receipt of the three (3) aptamers. Ranking of aptamers based on predicted aptamers' thermostability and the best two (2) sequences for each bacteria strain tested shall be provided three (3) months after receipt of aptamers' sequencing from the FDA. Total period of performance shall be one (1) calendar year from date of award.</p>
<p>Section II: Instructions to Prospective Respondents<br />Responses to this sources sought shall unequivocally demonstrate that respondent has the required equipment and personnel to perform the services.

<DESC>Introduction
<p><br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under NAICS code 541690 should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>1. Background.</p>
<p>Healthcare research and delivery in the modern era of molecular and personalized medicine requires reliable quantification of biomedical imaging data. Achieving reliable extraction of quantitative results from imaging scans requires a standardized approach to data acquisition, process and interpretation. Broad multidisciplinary stakeholder collaboration is needed to achieve cross-industry consensus on and adoption of quantitative imaging biomarkers, and this can only be achieved through a multi-stakeholder coalition supported by an entity recognized and trusted nationally and internationally as objective and balanced. Once achieved, reliable imaging quantification will lead to validation and qualification of imaging biomarkers for use in clinical trials, drug development and clinical decision-making.</p>
<p>2.1 Specification: Acquisition purpose.</p>
<p>The molecular bases of health and disease have become increasingly well understood in the past 20 years and suggest that each patient is likely to have a unique combination of genotypic, epigenetic, and phenotypic profiles for their disease. Healthcare delivery is now focused on trying to determine the most appropriate therapy for any patient's molecularly-unique version of disease. This concept is referred to as Precision Medicine, and it has been identified as a national priority, leading to the need for tests that can provide objective, reproducible information for clinical research and practice. Standardization of test performance and implementation will be absolutely essential in order for Precision Medicine to become reality.</p>
<p>Imaging biomarkers are of considerable interest in evidence-based clinical decision-making and for therapeutic development. The demand for quantitative results from imaging studies will increase as treatment decisions are driven by such results. Yet there remain substantial barriers to reproducible QI measures in clinical trials and clinical practice. There are several sources of bias and variance in the quantitative results obtained from clinical images. Thus the entire chain involved in producing a clinical image must be approached from a systems engineering perspective. Considerable work is needed to validate specific metrics, improve standardization across vendor platforms, and educate imaging physicians about the reliability of QI. An additional challenge confronting efforts to improve reproducibility in quantitative clinical imaging is the continual state of technological advancement that occurs in medical imaging hardware and software. Thus the quantitative accuracy of medical images has to be continually reassessed and the standardization requirements have to be periodically updated. This continuous, systematic appraisal of accuracy and precision is crucial to maintain confidence in quantitative interpretations.</p>
<p>Although there is widespread acceptance of the idea that biomarkers are increasingly important in drug and medical device development as well as in clinical decision-making, there is also broad concern that biomarker evaluation and implementation are not optimal. This concern is manifest in several current government activities including the:<br />&bull; 21ST Century Cures bill,<br />&bull; FDA Request for Comments on Biomarkers, and <br />&bull; Senate white paper "Innovations for Healthier Americans".<br /><br />To be clinically useful and valuable, it is essential that quantitative results from imaging scans be reproducible. Major impediments to reproducibility of QI results are the current differentiation in imaging vendor products and image analysis tools, as well as the independent activities of imaging physicians. Because the process of acquiring a clinical imaging scan is complex, the goal of improved reproducibility requires much coordinated activity among many stakeholders. What is needed is a collaborative organization uniquely poised to convene the relevant stakeholders to address the complex, inter-related issues involved in extracting quantitative results from images.</p>
<p>Why is a collaborative approach supported by the Public Sector needed? Efforts by individual manufacturers to establish quantitative imaging parameters as biomarkers are often more costly and time-consuming than the effort needed for traditional device clearance or approval. This is because biomarker validation requires data from clinical trials to demonstrate the imaging biomarker of interest correlates with a meaningful clinical endpoint. Individual companies are constrained by their business model to pursue only activities that can be justified in the short-term with respect to that company alone. Furthermore, individual manufacturers do not commonly address the need for cross-vendor standardization, which would enable a level of clinical effectiveness not currently possible when a given quantitative parameter depends in part on non-biological factors, such as vendor differences. Therefore, the standardization needed to minimize variation in multi-center studies and allow comparability of results from different trials necessitates a cooperative structure. With such standardization in place, it would be possible to perform multiple studies and pursue objectives that would not be feasible for individual sponsors of clinical research alone. Although many stakeholders are interested in this goal, none can accomplish it alone.</p>
<p>Appropriate deliverables from the envisioned collaboration of multiple stakeholders would be standards documents, groundwork activities to inform the specifications within those standards documents, test objects (physical and digital) to test some of those specifications, and datasets (image archives) to assess compliance with other specifications. The result of this data-driven, expert-consensus-guided activity would be a set of standardized specifications for image acquisition, collection, post-processing, and analysis. These standards documents should start with an imaging performance Claim stating what will be achieved by complying with the specifications in the document. Claims should focus on a specific clinical application and be written using a statistically rigorous framework and language. Specifications dictate what must be achieved and/or what technical capabilities must be demonstrated in using the imaging device to realize the Claim. There must also be a compliance strategy to allow vendors and users to determine whether equipment manufacturers and other "actors" along the imaging chain are compliant, using required or recommended phantoms (test objects), data sets, software, and other tools. Compliance programs might span a spectrum from self-attestation to formal third-party certifying programs.</p>
<p>To develop these standards documents, data relating to bias and variance of the biomarker measurement (referred to as groundwork data) will be extracted from the literature, and gaps in the published data necessary to understand the sources of variability will be noted. These gaps will lead to projects to obtain such missing data. All data created by the consortium shall be made available to the public, either for secondary analyses by other investigators, or to allow others to check and validate the conclusions drawn by the collaborative participants. Thus, the collaborative enterprise constructed to improve the accuracy and precision of QI must be stable and have policies and procedures for periodic updating of standards documents to reflect the emergence both of new data relevant to reducing bias and variability and also the introduction of new, complex technologies.</p>
<p>The standards documents should go through a series of maturation phases including a Public Comment phase. When the public comments have been documented and addressed, the document would be in a Publicly Reviewed phase, where it is considered reasonably stable and ready for trial implementation.</p>
<p>Why is all this effort necessary? In order to build trust in QIBs: <br />&bull; Vendors must understand and trust the clinical interest/value to implement<br />&bull; Regulators must understand and trust the claim, mechanisms, safety and effectiveness to approve<br />&bull; Imaging Physicians must understand and trust the performance and clinical relevance to use in their findings and conclusions<br />&bull; Payers must understand and trust the patient impact and cost effectiveness to reimburse<br />&bull; Clinicians must understand and trust the meaning and reliability to use QIBs in their clinical decisions</p>
<p>The collaboration described here is the necessary forum to address these challenges. <br /><br />The purpose of this Acquisition is to maintain the multi-stakeholder coalition already developed to achieve cross-industry consensus on and adoption of QIBs. The coalition must be supported by an entity recognized and trusted nationally and internationally as objective and balanced. Achieving reliable extraction of quantitative results from imaging scans requires both scientific understanding of the sources of bias and variance and multidisciplinary consensus around how best to minimize and compensate for such sources. Broad multidisciplinary stakeholder collaboration is needed to establish standardized approaches to data acquisition, process and interpretation. Once achieved, reliable imaging quantification will lead to validation and qualification of imaging biomarkers for use in clinical trials, drug development and clinical decision-making. The required activities are not well-supported by traditional NIH grant award processes, and, therefore, this contract mechanism is needed.</p>

<p>Scope of Work:<br />&nbsp;<br />As an independent contractor and not as a Government employee or representative, the Contractor will perform the tasks and/or projects necessary to (1) implement a validated model for QIB development to meet the requirements of clinical trials, and (2) following the model, develop and disseminate QIB Profiles for imaging biomarkers in active clinical trials and/or clinical practice. It is anticipated that actual projects to be funded will be selected by the QIB Steering Committee. In addition, the Contractor shall continue to manage a coordinated process structured to meet the scientific needs for QIBs, thereby enabling users and developers of healthcare imaging technology to achieve reproducible and accurate quantitative imaging results through the precise definition of clinical contexts, delineation of standards-based equipment specifications and protocol designs, and the conformance testing of systems to determine they adhere to the specifications.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall determine the methodology to be followed, the specific work plan, and the administrative management requirements for performing these tasks and projects. The work plan shall address imaging biomarkers in those areas already under development and/or identified as high priority by the broad, inclusive membership of the QIB consortium. The Contractor shall submit the proposed methodology and work plan(s) according to the Schedule of Deliverables shown below.</p>
<p>QIBA deliverable report:<br />a.) Proposed Project Methodology;<br />b.) Preliminary Workplan; and<br />c.) Ad hoc Reports</p>
<p>Proposed Project Methodology:<br /><br />The proposed project methodology should be detailed enough to answer such questions as the following:<br />- How will the Contractor develop a process for relating biomarkers to disease areas, setting the clinical context, and identifying and prioritizing what biomarker to pursue;<br />- How will the Contractor identify and/or develop a coordinated model for quantitative imaging biomarker development, including the structure and operation of the QIBA infrastructure;<br />- What are the potential solutions for error mitigation in imaging biomarker measurements such as PET-amyloid for brain imaging, Ultrasound shear wave speed (SWS) and/or MR elastography (MRE) for liver imaging, fMRI for pre-operative evaluation, and DW-MRI for tumor treatment response; <br />- How will the Contractor develop methodology or a paradigm that can be used to test hypotheses about the technical feasibility and medical value of these imaging biomarkers; <br />- How will the QIBA profiles' efficacy be assessed by vendors and researchers; and<br />- How will the QIBA solutions be disseminated?</p>
<p>Preliminary workplan:</p>
<p>For the purposes of this deliverable, the Contractor should excerpt this portion of the proposal, retitle it as Preliminary Workplan, and submit as a separate document for the COTR's review. We expect the preliminary workplan to be the same for all Biomarkers; however, in cases where the workplan differs substantially for a particular Biomarker, this Biomarker's workplan should be addressed in a more specific manner. This document should be organized so that there is an index identifying the overall workplan, the specifics for each Biomarker that will be developed differently, and a proposed timeline for achieving project goals and milestones.</p>
<p>Ad hoc Reports:</p>
<p>By their very nature, Ad hoc reports are not known in advance and would be related to a particular issue that might be of significant interest. It is envisioned that NIBIB would ask the Contractor to provide brief reports in defined formats (normally narrative with limited graphics) that would address such issues as:</p>
<p>- What are the scientific highlights achieved in a particular period, such as for a periodic report to the Congress or to the National Advisory Council;<br />- If a particular biomarker, in the process of assessing its efficacy, is found to be remarkable such that it needs extremely wide information dissemination in a very fast manner, a report might be requested to provide the noteworthy facts and scientific results for media release purposes; or<br />- Another reportable situation might arise if there were a major disagreement within the QIBA infrastructure that could impact the outcome of the entire project.</p>

<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Library of Medicine (NLM) is conducting a market survey to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, HUBZone small businesses; service- disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses capable of serving the needs identified below.</p>
<p><br />Background:</p>
<p>The mission of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) is to collect, organize, preserve, and disseminate the world's biomedical information for the good of the public. In addition to traditional library activities related to reference services, document delivery, and collection development, the Library develops a wide variety of electronic resources to meet the needs of various constituencies. The Library also conducts outreach to these user communities to make them aware of the Library's resources and services and to assist them in developing their capacity to use them effectively. The Division of Specialized Information Services (SIS) coordinates the development and operation of specialized information services throughout the NLM; plans, develops, and operates a national Environmental Health and Toxicology Information Program (TEHIP); develops and administers a program to organize and analyze published information on the effects of drugs and chemicals on mankind; develops and implements information and outreach programs in HIV/AIDS, consumer health, minority health and health disparities; and plans and operates an office supporting NLM's programs in disaster information. More details about the programs and services may be found on the SIS web site http://sis.nlm.nih.gov.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives:</p>
<p>The main goal of the proposed work is to:</p>
<p>Support SIS and NLM activities intended to increase awareness and use of NLM's medical and health information products and services, especially within minority (Native Americans, African Americans, Native Alaskans, Native Hawaiians) and other special populations (e.g., public health workforce, emergency responders, K-12 educators and students, HIV/AIDS impacted, etc.) in order to increase the use of electronic health information resources, strengthen and modernize biomedical research, training and applications and reduce health disparities.</p>
<p>In addition to the goal of improving health through these outreach projects, the role of the contractor is to help these collaborating or partner institutions, agencies and organizations develop the capacity to do this work independently in support of NLM's mission.</p>
<p>The primary thrust of the contract is human-to-human interaction including identification of partners and development of relationships for NLM to pursue. The contractor will be representing NLM's interests and supporting NLM in its work rather than independently carrying out work of their own choosing. NLM anticipated that the work will be carried out by one or a small number of individuals with appropriate expertise and experience as well as existing relationships with many of the intended audiences for NLM's information resources. It is also important to note that NLM does not conduct health campaigns such as those designed to encourage parents to have their babies sleep on their backs or to raise awareness of HIV in women and girls. The focus for NLM's projects and programs is to increase access to and use of NLM's information resources and services.</p>
<p>The contractor is required to carry out the following types of activities:</p>
<p>1. Identify opportunities to increase awareness and use of SIS and other NLM information, databases and other services and products among minority and other special populations.</p>
<p>This includes seeking out and identifying potential partners for SIS and NLM outreach projects or programs such as American Indian and Alaskan Native tribal leaders, tribal organizations, tribal health organizations, Native Hawaiian leaders and health organizations, Minority Serving Educational Institutions and their related organizations, minority health professional organizations, K-12 programs, public health agencies and organizations (particularly those serving refugees, immigrants or the disabled), disaster preparation, management and response agencies and teams, and other potential users of NLM and SIS resources and training. The main focus is on populations that are traditionally considered underserved, suffer from health disparities, or are of specific interest to SIS or NLM based on policy, or NLM's mission.</p>
<p>2. Assist NLM in identifying appropriate staff/leaders/community representatives with which to work.</p>
<p>Working closely with NLM staff, assist the Library in initiating and developing a working relationship. Assist in developing the basis for collaboration and identifying specific areas in which to work.</p>
<p>Working closely with NLM in developing and implementing projects with organizations or individuals identified. This may include subcontracting with organizations or individuals to fund specific undertakings. NLM may wish to work with up to 15 organizations or individuals in a year.</p>
<p><br />3. Provide technical and programmatic support in support of SIS outreach projects, including, but not limited to, the Environmental Health Information Partnership, Sacred Root Information Fellowship and other Tribal projects, international projects, information outreach and health information technology initiatives of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and other Minority Educational Institutions, disaster-related organizations and agencies, and other special populations. When necessary, and on behalf of SIS, conduct or participate in assessments of these programs.</p>
<p>This task may include participating in the development of programs for or with these groups. <br /><br />4. Provide technical and programmatic support to SIS, the NLM Office of the Director, and other NLM components, in collaboration with other federal agencies, including, but not limited to, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Minority Health, Indian Health Service, Office of Global Health Affairs, and the Office for the Advancement of Telehealth.</p>
<p>Assist with the development, implementation and conduct of programs and projects that focus on the use of health information technology to achieve the goal of improving use of and access to such technology and related health information. This includes alerting NLM staff about new technologies and new implementations related to telehealth, such as the use of the Internet for video medical interpreting over distance, use of GIS technology for community empowerment and health planning, and the use of virtual worlds and other types of visualization. All such endeavors are for the purpose of developing capacity in special populations to use these tools and to improve their health through the use of health information technology.</p>
<p>Examples of projects or activities included in the current or earlier versions of this contract:</p>
<p>&bull; Teen Health Leadership Project in which NLM works with the College of Nursing, Medical University of South Carolina; the Health Sciences Library, MUSC; St. Johns High School; Communities in Schools; and Charleston Unified School District. The contractor identified the opportunity; brought together the partners, implemented a subcontract for funding, and continues to serve as a liaison between the project partners and NLM.<br />&bull; Community Health Maps Blog, which started as an early effort to bring GIS technology to Native American organizations, now serves to share information about free or low cost GIS tools with community organization, educators and others. The contractor also identifies a small number of local organizations interested in implementing a GIS project using these tools and then writing a blog posting.<br />&bull; Identifying and subcontracting with expert consultants to meet NLM's needs for specific tasks related to this type of outreach.</p>
<p>These tasks may include participating in the development of programs for or with these groups. All programs are health information or health information technology-related activities. In some cases, the contractor shall implement programs independently, mainly through subcontracts, after they have been developed in conjunction with NLM staff. Approximately 2-15 such subcontracts may be implemented each year. The contractor may also conduct program assessments or evaluations, write reports, provide background research, etc. The contractor may assist in providing on-the-ground technical support and guidance during the implementation and conduct of a project. This may require site visits and meetings held remote from NLM. The contractor may also be required to organize 1-2 workshops, symposia, or conferences related to this work. The goal of these site visits and other interactions is to provide support, direction and guidance to outreach activities promoted and supported by NLM. Working with special populations is often difficult and requires a substantial amount of direct interaction. Travel and interactions will generally be within the U.S. However, approximately 3-5 trips may be international. In addition to the goal of improving health through these outreach projects, the role of the contractor is to help these institutions, agencies and organizations develop the capacity to do this work independently.</p>

<DESC>This Sources Sought notification is for marketing purposes only and does not commit the Government to issuing an award.
<p>In accordance with FAR 19.202-4, this request is for planning purpose only and does not constitute an Invitation for Bid, Request for Proposal, Solicitation, Request for Quote or an indication the Government will contract for the services contained in this announcement. This is a Sources Sought regarding potential sources and is for market research purposes only.</p>
<p>The intent of the SOURCES SOUGHT announcement is to conduct market research to identify sources to support informed decision makers to procure for the attached required service. This notice is a Sources Sought for all interested qualified businesses that meets the requirements in this draft effort.</p>
<p>Business Objective:</p>
<p>The Office of the Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs, Office of Policy, Planning and Resources (R/PPR) provides long-term strategic planning and performance measurement for the Department of State's public diplomacy and public affairs activities worldwide. The office assists the Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs (R) in the development of long-term strategic vision and integrates that vision into the Department's strategic planning processes. R/PPR provides a focal point for public diplomacy resource management, consulting closely with regional and functional public diplomacy offices and public affairs sections overseas.</p>
<p>R/PPR has access to significant amounts of budget and financial and program evaluation and analytical data, supported by a myriad of tools and systems that generate valuable information for the Public Diplomacy (PD) community. These tools, systems and data streams, however, are manual, semi-manual and automated, and in many cases stove-piped and duplicative and operated by multiple organizations, making their efficient and effective use elusive. R/PPR envisions a new technology framework that expedites the work of PD practitioners world-wide and serves as a cutting-edge paradigm for other organizations to emulate.</p>
<p>Within this context, R/PPR aims to build upon the history and lessons learned from implementing and operating existing PD tools and systems to define a new "enter once, share extensively" technology framework. R/PPR seeks a streamlined set of user-facing solutions that continue to build upon its recent adoption of the "human-centric" design approach to improve day-to-day workflows, increase tool adaption and usage, minimize unnecessary and duplicative data entry, and maximize data sharing, data analytics and reporting; these user-facing solutions will be powered by a set of integrated databases, data marts and data warehouses. The revamped and newly developed systems must smoothly integrate into existing work flows and where possible ease existing workloads; otherwise they will be underutilized or not used at all. Existing systems must be maintained during the development and incremental rollout of new systems under the envisioned framework.</p>
<p>R/PPR seeks a future technology architecture that leverages, to the greatest extent possible, commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) and open-source technologies that enable faster "time-to-market" delivery of products and services at optimum and reduced cost outlays.</p>
<p>R/PPR wishes to assess the availability and abilities of organizations from all industry sources, both big and small business, to meet the capabilities and requirements listed below. Please identify GSA Schedule or other GWAC, if applicable. Interested sources shall possess and demonstrate an in-depth understanding and long-term experience and success in meeting all of the requirements listed below.

<DESC>The Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC) requires a hardware and software refresh requirement for systems used by software developers who build and maintain DTIC's capability to support Science and Technology information availability and reliability for research purposes. DTIC's current Macintosh computer capability has exceeded end-of-life, is failing, and must be refreshed. The technical refresh will replace all existing systems in inventory with updated hardware and software to comply with network security requirements set forth by the DoD. In addition we have been in communication with the EITSD - Macintosh COE at WHS Pentagon. They have recommended the addition of network management software (Casper Suite) and client PKI software (AdmitMac) to increase administration and security of these systems.

<DESC>The focus of this effort will be to further the efforts conducted under contract M67854-11-C-3015. All efforts under the new vehicle stem directly from off-leash detection expertise developed under contract M67854-11-C-3015 and award to any other company would require substantial duplication of tasks and funds already contributed under the previous effort for off-leash canines, individuals, training and research. The continuity of all these aspects combined is critical to the success of the new effort. <br>  <br> The U.S. Army and U.S. Army Research Office, and Military Working Dog Programs have strategic needs in support of advancing the capability, training, science and technology, and analysis of using military working dogs for the fight against terrorism.  Military working dog systems developed in the recent combat activities in Afghanistan and Iraq have demonstrated new opportunities and gaps in the use of military working dogs for security and tactical operations. The requirements in this effort are directly relevant to enhancing capabilities developed in the IED Defeat Dog program at K2 Solutions and leveraging into new research and development programs now that those efforts have ended. <br>  <br> The Government has basic and applied research needs surrounding the fundamental aspects of canine genetics for selection, scent improvement performance, advanced training, advanced off-leash operational procedures and kit and gear for canines that have been trained, sustained, conditioned and deployed in Theatre in an off-leash detection capacity.   <br>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION DOCUMENT <br> FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION <br> Schedule B and C Grounds Maintenance <br>  <br>  <br> 1.	CONTRACTING AGENCY:  922nd Contracting Battalion, MICC-Fort Campbell <br>  <br>  2.  DESCRIPTION OF ACTION:  A modification is requested to the base contract with LKJ Crabbe Inc. to add Schedules B and C grounds maintenance on Fort Campbell for two months.  Modification will be a FFP using OMA funds with an anticipated dollar amount of $646,375.00.   <br>  <br> 3.  DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES:  The total estimated value of the proposed action is $646,375.00 for a two (2) month period of performance.  The service is grounds maintenance Schedules B and C for Ft. Campbell, KY.  Schedules B and C contain the entire cantonment area with the exception of High Visibility Areas and Division Parade Field (Schedule A), consisting of two airfields, two landfill areas and the on Fort Campbell, for a total amount of approximately 4,500 acres.  The grounds maintenance includes mowing, leaf and grass clipping removal, turf repair, aeration, fertilization, overseeding, dethatching, and herbicide application.  Mowing takes place on 2 to 3 week cycles.  The proposed modification would add Schedules B and C grounds maintenance to a contract that already contains Schedule A. <br>   <br> 4.  AUTHORITY CITED: This action is authorized under provisions of 41 U.S.C 1901 and FAR 13.501(a)(1)(ii), Test Program for Commercial Items, Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 as codified at 10 USC Sec. 2304(g)(1)(B), and amended by Section 807 of the Ronald Reagan National Defense Authorization Act of 2005  <br>  <br>  <br> 5.  REASON FOR AUTHORITY CITED: The current contractor for Schedules B and C, Saturn Landscaping Plus, refused to perform a delivery order issued for Schedules B and C.  LKJ Crabbe is the current contractor for Schedule A grounds maintenance on Fort Campbell.  Martinelli Landscaping is the current contractor for Schedule D grounds maintenance on Fort Campbell.  Out of both current contractors, LKJ Crabbe stated that they would be able to perform Schedules B and C grounds maintenance, while Martinelli stated that they could not.  LKJ Crabbe has a successful performance history and has the ability to quickly obtain the assets to perform Schedules B and C for a two-month bridge contract.  They are readily available and would decrease the time that troop labor would be needed to maintain unit areas as opposed to having a new contractor come in to perform for only two months while a new contract with a base and option periods is put into place.   <br>  <br> a.	Background: The current period of performance under the ground maintenance contracts are in an extension under FAR 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services.  With the mowing season already started, it is unrealistic to expect another contractor with no experience on Fort Campbell to execute grounds maintenance for 4,500 acres for only two months.  LKJ Crabbe has been performing at Fort Campbell for a number of years and is readily available with assets to perform grounds maintenance for Schedules B and C.  A new contractor will need phase in time, which would be longer than having LKJ Crabbe perform with the capability to mobilize additional assets in only two weeks.   <br>  <br> b.	Alternatives: The alternative to not having a contractor execute grounds maintenance is using troop labor from Division and tenant units on Fort Campbell.  This is not a viable alternative due to the amount of acreage that must be mowed, lack of equipment available, and lack of time available from soldiers to consistently complete mowing to an acceptable standard.  The tenant units could purchase or rent equipment, but would not be cost effective since the equipment would only be needed for a short amount of time.   <br>  <br> c.	Justification: With the refusal of Saturn Landscaping Plus to perform their delivery order for Schedules B and C, a sole source contract to LKJ Crabbe is the most reasonable approach.  They are currently performing grounds maintenance on Fort Campbell in other areas of the post successfully and have the required assets readily available to cover the cantonment area and airfields with a very short mobilization time, thereby minimizing need for troop labor.  The pricing they submitted to perform grounds maintenance Schedules B and C for two months is fair and reasonable.  This is only a bridge contract that will give MICC-Fort Campbell the time needed to reprocure a new contact. <br>  <br> d.	Prior Acquisitions: W91248-12-D-0002 Schedule B and C grounds maintenance.  Contract has a base year with two option periods and FAR clause 52.217-8. <br>  <br> e.	Impact:  If this justification is not approved, then soldiers will be tasked on a weekly basis to complete grounds maintenance and it will take them away from completing mission critical training in preparation for worldwide deployment.  Additionally, there would be increased costs to the Government with the purchasing or renting of grounds maintenance equipment that would only be needed for two months. <br>  <br> 6.  EFFORTS TO OBTAIN COMPETITION: The two incumbent contractors for grounds maintenance covering different areas of Fort Campbell were contacted to see if they had the capability to add Schedules B and C.  The contractors were LKJ Crabbe Inc. who performs Schedule A and Martinelli Landscaping who performs Schedule D.  The fact that they are currently performing on Fort Campbell was the reason they were contacted.  Out of the two, only LKJ Crabbe stated that they could perform Schedules B and C grounds maintenance for two months until a new contract is put into place.   <br>  <br> 7.  ACTIONS TO INCREASE COMPETITION:  MICC-Fort Campbell will be issuing a Request for Quotations over FedBizzOps for Schedules B, C, and D grounds maintenance using a HUB Zone set aside.  The proposed sole-source modification to Crabbe's contract will only be for two months, to allow time for MICC Fort Campbell to solicit quotes, conduct technical evaluations, award the contract, and phase in the contractor or contractors who will perform Schedules B and C grounds maintenance.  The new contract would have a start date of on or around 15 June 2015 with a 3 month base and two (2) twelve month option periods. <br>  <br> 8.  MARKET RESEARCH:  The market research performed an industry survey in January 2015 for the reprocurement of grounds maintenance for Schedules B, C, and D identified numerous vendors that would be interested in performing grounds maintenance on Fort Campbell.  These vendors will be able to participate in the new solicitation as long as they are a HUB Zone business.   <br>  <br> 9.  INTERESTED SOURCES:  A pre-solicitation notice for the follow on grounds maintenance contract for Schedules B, C, and D on Fort Campbell was posted on 8 January 2015.  The solicitation was released on 26 February 2015 as a HUBZone set aside.  The solicitation was canceled on 18 March 2015 due to the incorrect solicitation type used and decision to extend the current contracts for six months using FAR clause 52.217-8.  A new solicitation will be released with updated periods of performance for Schedules B, C, and D.  At the time of the cancellation of the solicitation there were two responses.  One response came from Ryan Slaughter and the other response came from A4G.  Notices required by FAR 5.201 shall be published and any quotes received shall be considered.   <br>  <br> 10.  OTHER FACTS: <br>  <br> a.  Procurement History: W91248-12-D-0002, Schedules B and C Grounds Maintenance; W91248-12-D-0003, Schedule D Grounds Maintenance; W91248-12-D-0004, Schedule A Grounds Maintenance <br>  <br>     (1). All three contracts were awarded with a base year with two option years and FAR clause 52.217-8. <br>  <br> b.  Acquisition data availability: N/A <br>  <br> c.  Unusual and compelling urgency: N/A <br>  <br> d.  Subcontracting Competition: N/A  <br>

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The U.S. AbilityOne Commission (operating name of the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Commission, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Commission's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Commission is required to complete an impact analysis related to the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		7930-00-NIB-0675<br />Name:		Floor Finish/Sealer, Black, Water-Based, Slip-Resistant, Asphalt Floors, 4/1 Gal. Bottles<br />Description:	Black floor finish features a combination of acrylic copolymers, plasticizers and black pigment that beautify and protect porous asphalt plank surfaces. Enhances gloss for better light reflection and replaces black coloration grayed by daily wear. This low VOC and zinc free formula does not contain heavy metals, A.P.E.'s or phthalates. Meets or exceeds Slip Resistance Standards (when properly maintained) established by CSPA and UL as tested in accordance with ASTM D-2047.UOI is BX. BX = (4) 1 gallon bottles.</p>
<p>NSN:		7930-00-NIB-0717<br />Name:		Floor Finish/Sealer, Black, Water-Based, Slip-Resistant, Asphalt Floors, 5 Gal. Can<br />Description:	Black floor finish features a combination of acrylic copolymers, plasticizers and black pigment that beautify and protect porous asphalt plank surfaces. Enhances gloss for better light reflection and replaces black coloration grayed by daily wear. This low VOC and zinc free formula does not contain heavy metals, A.P.E.'s or phthalates. Meets or exceeds Slip Resistance Standards (when properly maintained) established by CSPA and UL as tested in accordance with ASTM D-2047.UOI is CN. CN = 5 gallons.</p>
<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Commission to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Services Administration, Fort Worth, TX.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Commission considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been thus far determined to likely be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN:			7930-00-NIB-0675<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	7930-01-486-5067; 7930-01-380-8450</p>
<p>NSN:			7930-00-NIB-0717<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	184335; R16635 / 5DMZ3; 14642 / 10F954; 3CA42 / MIDNIGHT GLOSS; 7930-01-410-8562 7930-01-380-8406</p>
<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Broad (B-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the items listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Commission:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Commission no later than May 1, 2015 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Commission will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Commission and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Commission's website at www.abilityone.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this Notice or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<DESC><p>This is a request for information (RFI). DLA Troop Support's OCONUS Subsistence Prime Vendor (OCONUS SPV) Program is interested in your comments regarding full service food support to our military and federally funded customers in the Kuwait, Iraq, and Jordan. There is no solicitation available at this time. The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this RFI, nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing the information provided to the Government. This RFI does not constitute a commitment from the Government and any information provided in response to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only and will not be released. Any proprietary information submitted will be protected if appropriately marked. Vendor participation is not a promise for future business with the Government. The sole purpose of this RFI is to conduct Market Research.<br />Please consider the following questions:</p>
<p>1. What type of business is your company in - logistics, food distribution? Who are your firm's major customers, e.g. retailers, industrial accounts, commercial accounts? Is your company foreign or is it considered a large or small business concern? Small business is generally defined as a firm that employs less than 500 employees. Is your business identified under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)? What is your firm's country of origin?</p>
<p>2. Do you have any long-term contracts with your customers and/or suppliers? If yes, please describe. If no, please explain why, e.g., pricing too volatile, no interest.</p>
<p>3. Subsistence Prime Vendor support includes, but is not limited to: sourcing food items; receiving and consolidating product; warehousing and inventory management; quality control, quality assurance, and inspections; transportation and security of product, personnel management, meeting required delivery dates, and extensive reporting requirements. At the present time, customers in Kuwait, Iraq, and Jordan are primarily supported from one warehouse platform located in Kuwait. Do you have a warehouse platform located in Kuwait, Jordan, and/or Iraq? Would it be more feasible to establish warehouse platforms in more than one of these countries to meet customer requirements? Identify any constraints that may prevent your firm from developing warehouse platforms in Kuwait, Jordan, and/or Iraq. Note: sales estimates are identified in question 4 below.</p>
<p>4. Total yearly sales are estimated at $82M ($71M Kuwait, $2M Iraq, and $9M Jordan). Product and premium sales (e.g., trucking; airlifts; private security; transportation officers and other field service personnel; storage of Government Furnished Material (GFM), and office space) are included in the sales estimate. Can your firm manage this volume? What is the dollar value of product going through your warehouse on an annual basis?</p>
<p>5. Transportation from the Continental United States (CONUS) to the Middle East via the Defense Transportation System (DTS) is required. Offerors will be required to use contracts established by the United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM). The Contractor will be responsible for preparing and request bookings and the carrier will be responsible for the transportation of the Contractor's products from the specified CONUS manufacturer or CONUS distribution facility to the PV's OCONUS distribution facilities. Would your firm have any issues using the DTS system already established?</p>
<p>6. The Prime Vendor will be required to execute intra-country airlifts to meet delivery requirements that cannot be fulfilled by traditional means (truck). Although there are air tenders in place through TRANSCOM, do you have a working arrangement in place with a commercial air source that has the ability to provide this type of support, including the ability to tri-wall and utilize dry ice when necessary.<br />Any suggestion from you that demonstrates new creative ways to meet our customer's requirements would be appreciated.</p>
<p>7. The contract will require delivery of pork items to DoD and other federal customers in Kuwait, Iraq, and Jordon. It will be the contractor's responsibility to determine how to satisfy this requirement. Do you see any issue being able to provide this commodity to the customer?</p>
<p>8. Sometimes the need will exist to transport product overland from Kuwait to Qatar or Kuwait to Jordan, if a Jordan warehouse platform does not exist. Would your firm be able to accomplish this requirement?</p>
<p>9. Private Security is currently being used with all Iraq deliveries. Does your company have any experience with providing Private Security or do you have any issue with this requirement?</p>
<p>10. In addition to your ability to provide domestic products from the United States, you will also need to provide Local Market Ready items (LMR) as well as Fresh Fruits and Vegetables (FF&amp;V) from the local economy. Do you currently have any affiliations with local providers?</p>
<p>11. Operational Rations and/or Government Furnished Material (OPRATS/GFM) will also have to be stored at your OCONUS facilities. Do you see any problem with this requirement?</p>
<p>12. Would your firm be able to manage emergency deliveries defined as a same day delivery?</p>
<p>13. A Surge Requirement is one that could increase the normal orders by 200-300% in which you would be required to satisfy requirements for emergency situations (i.e., ramp up to meet early requirements (surge) and/or requirements that may exceed estimated annual quantities). How would you be able to accommodate this increase? What would be the time period to attain these increased quantities? How long could you continue to operate at this increased output of products?</p>
<p>14. For the following questions, please review DLAD 52.216-9065 Economic Price Adjustment - Actual Material Costs for Subsistence Product Price Business Model (NOV 2011) at http://farsite.hill.af.mil/reghtml/regs/other/dlad/part52.htm#P10957_912667 in its entirety.<br />Paragraphs (b) (3-5) generally provide the following:<br />(3) "Product price" is the most recent DLA Troop Support MP) price or the most recent manufacturer, grower or private label holder commercial price per unit to the Contractor, exclusive of standard freight.<br />(i) Exceptions:<br />(A) Fresh fruits and vegetables (FF&amp;V):<br />(1) The product is listed in the distribution category for prime vendor fresh fruits and vegetables (FF&amp;V)){buyer fill in}; and<br />(2) It is necessary for the product to be transported into the local market of the importer, as otherwise approved under the contract, from a foreign country because local supply does not exist or it is insufficient to meet demand requirements; and<br />(3) The importer that establishes the product price is the firm that actually performs the FF&amp;V import service, including, but not limited to: procurement, storage, consolidation, pallets, and palletizing as it applies to the importer's normal commercial sales, and the importer has comparable commercial sales in the market that is the point of import.<br />(B) A contiguous United States (CONUS) based manufacturer, grower or private label holder's product pricing which is a national price inclusive of transportation costs to a Distribution Point<br />shall be supported by documentation and may be considered by the Government on a case by case basis, upon concurrence of the Contracting Officer.<br />(C) Mandatory source items: The product price shall be limited to the nonprofit agency's price for product as set in accordance with applicable law. The product price shall be based on f.o.b. origin/nonprofit agency. (Prices set in accordance with applicable law (f.o.b. origin/nonprofit agency.)<br />(D) Prime vendor table displays/decorations only: For products listed in category [buyer fill-in category number] prime vendor table displays/decorations only, the product price shall be based on f.o.b. origin/point of the manufacturer's distributor because the manufacturer will not sell directly to the prime vendor. This exception must be approved by the Contracting Officer on a case by case basis. Support documentation is required.<br />(E) A CONUS-based redistributor's price for a specific manufacturer's product (also known as a stock keeping unit (SKU)) may be considered by the Government as long as the redistributor's price for the quantity ordered is equal to or lower than the manufacturer's published price inclusive of discounts/allowances. This exception must be approved by the Contracting officer on a case by case basis. Support documentation may be required.<br />(4) "Product allowance" is discounts, rebates, and allowances to be passed on to the Government. In accordance with other provisions of the contract, all discounts, rebates, or allowances on particular items which are reflected in the amounts shown on the face of the manufacture's, grower's or private label holder's invoice (referred to as "off-invoice allowances") or otherwise given to the Contractor by the manufacturer, grower or private label holder, shall be passed by the Contractor to the Government, in the form of an up-front price reduction. The total of these discounts, rebates, and allowances (or product allowance), shall be reflected via a reduced subsistence total order and receipt electronic system (STORES) price, resulting in a lower invoice price to the customer. Any rebates that must be passed to the Government and which cannot be applied as an up-front price reduction must be submitted via check made to the United States (U.S.) Treasury, attached with itemized listing of all customer purchases by line item to include contract number, call number, purchase order number and contract line-item number (CLIN).<br />(5) "Distribution price(s)" means the firm fixed price portion of the Contract unit price, offered as a dollar amount per unit of issue, rounded up or down to the nearest cent. The distribution price is the only method for the Contractor to bill the Government for all aspects of contract performance other than product price, including but not limited to, the performance requirements of this statement of work (SOW). As detailed above in paragraph (3) of this clause, product price is distinct from and not to be included in the distribution price. For use in outside contiguous United States (OCONUS) location(s) that do not use distribution price language in alternates I or II. {Buyer fill-in OCONUS location(s)}.<br />Can you comply with all terms and conditions within this Economic Price Adjustment clause and pricing model? If not, please explain in detail what part(s) of the clause pose any problems and why.</p>
<p>15. The terms of the Berry Amendment, 10 U.S.C. 2533a, will apply to the resulting contract. In general, items that are subject to the Berry Amendment must be grown, reprocessed, or produced in the United States or its possessions, see DFARS Clause 252.225-7012. Based on the foregoing, can you provide Berry Amendment compliant products?</p>
<p>16. All packaging and packing shall be in accordance with best commercial practices. Labeling shall be in accordance with commercial labeling complying with the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act 21 U.S.C. 301 et seq. and regulations promulgated there under. However, there will be various packaging sizes based on customer needs which include, but are not limited to different packaging/packing size,<br />marking/labeling, and palletization/containerization. The Pallets used must be a two way entry wing type pallet. All Wood Packaging Material (WPM) acquired by DoD must meet requirements of International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures (ISPM) 15, "Guidelines for Regulating Wood Packaging Materials (WPM) in International Trade." DoD shipments inside and outside of the United States must meet ISPM 15 whenever WPM is used to ship DoD cargo, or when wood is being acquired by DLA for future use as packaging material. WPM is defined as wood pallets, skids, load boards, pallet collars, wooden boxes, reels, dunnage, crates, frame and cleats. Are you able to comply with these varying packaging/packing, marking/labeling and palletization /containerization, as stated?</p>
<p>17. As far as shelf life of delivered products the following applies: All products delivered shall be as fresh as possible and within the manufacturer's original shelf life (i.e., Best if Used by Date, Expiration Date, or other markings). Chilled products shall not be frozen in an attempt to extend the products' shelf life, unless approved by the Contracting Officer. For annual pack items, products will be from the latest seasonal pack available, unless approved in advance by the Contracting Officer. For items produced with shelf life greater than 90 days, no product shall be delivered to customers with less than 30 days manufacturer's original shelf life remaining unless the customer grants prior written approval. For items produced with shelf life less than 90 days, no product shall be delivered to customers with less than 5 days manufacturer's original shelf life remaining unless the customer grants prior written approval. Would your business be able to comply with these requirements? Some items such as ESL milk and cottage cheese have shorter shelf life than most cataloged items. Would your company be able to deliver these types of products with the required amount of shelf life mentioned above?</p>
<p><br />We encourage, appreciate, and would like to thank you in advance for your participation. Your responses, comments, suggestions and ideas regarding support for our customers are requested back by the close of business on Friday, April 24, 2015. Please response via e-mail to the following addresses: Raynard.Jamison@dla.mil, Cedric.Marlow@dla.mil, and Linda.Ford@dla.mil.</p>

<DESC><strong>Request for Information</strong>
<p><strong>Clinical Studies Management and Support </strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PURPOSE</span></strong></p>
<p>The National Institute of Arthritis, Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) is soliciting input from potential Offerors and other interested parties to help inform the Institute about innovative ways to enhance its clinical studies management/support requirement for the Extramural Program (EP). This special notice is in advance of a Request for Proposal (RFP) solicitation planned to be issued during the fourth quarter of 2015.<br />The overall purpose of the NIAMS Clinical Studies Management and Support requirement is to provide scientific and technical support in the conduct of clinical research funded by the Institute. The NIAMS is interested in receiving ideas from potential Offerors which will aid in the design of a future solicitation. The Institute welcomes ideas from leaders in the field of clinical research management support that will enhance its clinical research management operations.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BACKGROUND</span></strong></p>
<p>As part of its research mission, The National Institute of Arthritis, Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) supports clinical research on the cause, incidence, prevalence, prevention and treatment of arthritis, musculoskeletal, and skin diseases and disorders. These extramural-funded studies are supported by grants, cooperative agreements and contracts and include research of diverse study design, clinical setting, size and complexity.</p>
<p>The NIAMS extramural program clinical research portfolio covers a range of clinical efforts. Studies include very early phase, short-term, pilot evaluations involving few participants at a single-site, to more robust, long-term, multi-site studies involving several hundred participants. Studies could include preventive and therapeutic interventional clinical trials as well as observational clinical studies. <br />Given the diverse range of studies in the NIAMS clinical portfolio, there is special attention given to the varying degrees of risk to participants. The risk, as well as the scope and complexity of the research influences the safety monitoring required by the NIAMS to monitor these studies. <br />The NIAMS is committed to funding clinical research which is conducted in the most scientifically valid, safe, and efficient manner possible. In an effort to enhance its clinical management operations, the NIAMS would like interested parties to offer their ideas relating to the latest advances in the field of clinical research management and support.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">QUESTIONS FOR CONSIDERATION</span></strong></p>
<p>The NIAMS invites interested parties to respond to the following:</p>
<p>1. Describe an unmet need in clinical research management and support operations and how addressing this need could improve an organization's ability to effectively manage its clinical studies? <br /><br />2. What are the technological innovations and capabilities required for sharing clinical trial data? What are the limitations and costs of providing a system for data sharing?<br /><br />3. What are the most critical areas to consider for developing a state-of-the art clinical management and support contract? Responses should include but need not to be limited to these areas:<br /><br />a. Study design and protocol writing and study materials development<br />b. Statistical design, analysis, and reporting<br />c. Clinical site monitoring<br />d. Safety monitoring committees/oversight <br />e. Data management<br />f. Regulatory support<br />g. Information management systems for tracking progress for clinical studies</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information Submission Instructions </span></strong></p>
<p>All responses must be submitted via email to Cornelius Moore at mooreco@nhlbi.nih.gov by 4 PM on May 12, 2015. Responses are limited to 5 pages and must be submitted via a Microsoft Word document (.doc or .docx) or a non-image created PDF.</p>
<p>Please include the Notice number in the subject line. Response to this RFI is voluntary. Responders are free to address any or all of the categories listed above.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DISCLAIMER AND IMPORTANT NOTES</span></strong></p>
<p>This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate.

<p>MPCUGLES was developed at the University of Minnesota. NAVSEA - Carderock requires complex modifications that entail crashback analyses of geometries that will deform under hydrodynamic loading and increasingly computationally intensive problems, such as predicting turbulence ingestion. The analysis of deforming geometries requires a fully-coupled fluid-structure interaction (FSI) capability which entails the computation of fluid loadings on the propeller blades, a structural analysis code to compute the blade deformations and computation of new loads in a cyclical workflow. The computationally intensive problems require efficient simulation of billions of grid elements.</p>

<DESC>The Contractor shall develop trans cranial ultrasound phased arrays that can provide brain tissue imaging noninvasively by using shear wave propagation through the skull.  It is expected that the results will demonstrate trans-skull imaging capable of handling a wide variety of skull variation and determine the system resolution necessary to discriminate between various serious medical conditions. The Contractor shall develop and test different imaging pulse sequences and will be able to determine the most promising pulse sequence for future clinical testing. Previous clinical testing has shown that ultrasound echoes can be obtained in humans through intact skull bones such that brain shifts can be determined utilizing a single ultrasound beam providing a single line of echoes.  This objective is to use the phased arrays to obtain complete two and three dimensional images of the brain tissue.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION
The Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Program Contracting Activity Central (PCAC) intends to award a contract on a sole source basis with DirectTrust in order to become a DirectTrust.org member.
BACKGROUND
On December 20, 2012 The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) released the Exemplar Health Information Exchange Governance Entities Program Funding Opportunity Announcement. Two existing governance organizations, DirectTrust and the New York eHealth Collaborative, on behalf of the Electronic Health Records (HER)/Health Information Exchange (HIE) Interoperability Workgroup, received cooperative agreements with ONC. Specifically, DirectTrust was tasked with developing and adopting policies; interoperability requirements and business practices that align with national priorities; overcoming EHR interoperability challenges; reducing implementation costs for providers and patients; and assuring the privacy and security of health information exchange. DirectTrust is working with ONC to implement the technical mechanism and process for trust anchor exchange to enable Directed exchange more easily across vendor boundaries, as well as to develop and implement a federated agreement among accredited participants that avoids the need for one to one legal agreements. They will also continue development of the national accreditation program for health information service providers (HISPs), certificate authorities (CAs), and registration authorities (RA) who act as trusted agents on behalf of users of Directed exchange. The accreditation program, launched in November 2012 in partnership with the Electronic Healthcare Network Accreditation Commission (EHNAC), was targeted to achieve wide scale participation by the end of 2013.
In September of 2014, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) entered into a contract with The Electronic Healthcare Network Accreditation Commission (EHNAC) (partner of DirectTrust) in order to become accredited under the accreditation program for trusted agents. This accreditation will allow the VHA to securely exchange health information with other healthcare entities. 
REQUIREMENT DESCRIPTION
The contractor shall provide a full membership to DirectTrust.org which provides access to DirectTrust deliverables and intellectual property, as well as participation in DirectTrust workgroups; Up to date information about the continually evolving regulatory environment; Opportunities to influence and shape the developing Trust Framework; Insight into the work being done by your colleagues in the community; and Discounted access to DTO products, most notably the accreditation process.
The VHA, PCAC anticipates a single award, firm-fixed-price contract in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Parts 12 and 13. The anticipated contract period will include a 12 month base period, with two (2) option periods to follow. The applicable NAICS code is 813920 with a size standard of $15.0 million.
ADMINISTRATIVE 
The VHA, PCAC intends on awarding this contract pursuant to the authority of FAR 13.106-1 (b). DirectTrust was specifically awarded a cooperative agreement by the ONC to promote good governance practices and enhance the exchange of health information and is the only organization throughout the country for vendors and providers of Direct services.  All desired VA Direct partners are part of DirectTrust and all have, or are working toward, DirectTrust Accreditation.  There are no other nationwide organizations that provide Direct accreditation or that bring together all major Direct participants nationwide.  This makes DirectTrust uniquely qualified to fill this role.
Responsible sources may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit a quotation or capability statement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, responses received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC. The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution <br> of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   <br>  <br> This requirement is to acquire depot maintenance, scheduled overhaul, unscheduled overhaul, contingency operations, vendor repair, transportation, LRU procurement, depot work loading, travel, SW/FW sustainment for TPS, and TDP sustainment for repair and test procedures.  The purpose of this requirement is to implement the Sentinel LCCS in the form of supply support, depot level line repairable maintenance, updates to interactive electronic technical manuals, and contractor fielded engineer technical assistance required to maintain a 90 percent readiness rate as required by Army Regulation 700-138, for the Sentinel Radar System worldwide for calendar years (CY) 2016 - 2018. <br>  <br> The prime contractor, TRS, LLC, 1801 Hughes Drive, Fullerton, California, 92833, CAGE Code 1TDN2, is the only source that can meet this requirement.  The contractor has developed the technical expertise to perform the required services, and no other source can provide the needed LCCS effort in a timely or cost effective manner.  For a second source to be able to perform the LCCS services requirement, that source would need to have access to the TDP that is currently owned by the contractor.  It would cost the Government $40,000,000 to procure the TDP in which the contractor has not expressed interest in selling the TDP.  Additionally, it will take seven years to qualify a second source. TRS, LLC is the sole developer of the basic Sentinel Radar System which was competitively procured as a non-developmental item (NDI).  TRS, LLC designed, developed, and is the current manufacturer/integrator of the Sentinel Radar System basic, improved, and derivative systems. <br>  <br> If there are additional questions about this announcement, please contact Mr. Johnny Keith II in writing only at johnny.l.keith.civ@mail.mil

Contractors who are not already registered should consider applying for registration at least two weeks prior to invoicing. <BR> <BR>(f)  The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government?s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(g)(1)(i)  If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name with a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to?
      (A)  Change the name in the SAM database; 
      (B)  Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and
      (C)  Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. 
    (ii)  If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of Payment? paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. 
   (2)  The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.  Information provided to the Contractor?s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 
(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

<p>SPECIFICATIONS: DHS, FEMA, MWEOC has a need to create an anti-piggybacking solution for an existing entryway while still maintaining ADA access compliance through the hallway. The purchase and installation of a Boon Edam TAP 50 Secure Half Entry Portal OR EQUAL product was determined to be the most efficient and economical structure for solving this problem. It will be placed over an existing door converting it into a high security entrance to create a physical barrier which will eliminate tailgating and piggybacking; thus allow only one person passage at a time. Both access and egress will be controlled through this secure portal. The fail safe for fire alarms will be to the non-secure side of the portal. The portal's monitoring/control capabilities must be fully programmable and integrate with MWEOC's current access control security monitoring system, C-Cure 9000 ACS with HID RP40 readers. The portal must maintain ADA access compliance through the hallway to the office spaces beyond. The existing hallway is 81 inches wide. After installation, the portal must be capable of allowing access to the rear of the building by sustaining a minimum of 42 inches for the passageway to the office spaces. The secure half entry portal must also include a one year warranty for labor and materials. ATTACHMENT A is a drawing of the area in which the security portal will be installed. The door marked 101A is where the security portal is needed. The total width of the hallway outside this door is 6'-9 3/4" (81-3/4"). The secure half entry portal will be installed over the existing doorway (101A) which measures 3'-4" (40") wide. It must be installed without modifying the building and still maintaining a minimum 3'-6" (42") clearance in the hall passageway to the door labeled 115A. The door in the enclosure must be able to be access controlled by badging in and stepping inside and then the door closing behind you.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>&emsp;<br />1.7. Response Dates</p>
<p>Full Proposals</p>
<p>Due: June 01, 2015</p>
<p>1.8. Research Opportunity Description<br />1.8.1 DHS Agricultural Screening Tools Project Structure and Background</p>
<p>The Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) on Defense of United States Agriculture and Food (HSPD-9), which defines policy for defense of U.S. agriculture and food, identifies DHS as the lead agency to coordinate federal activities to "accelerate and expand development of current and new countermeasures against intentional introduction or natural occurrence of catastrophic animal, plant, or zoonotic diseases." DHS carries out this responsibility in close collaboration with its sector-specific agency partners (especially United States Department of Agriculture, USDA).</p>
<p>Pursuant to this mission, the Chemical and Biological Defense Division (CBD) seeks technologies to prevent and protect against any infectious disease attack on our Agricultural resources. The Agricultural Defense Branch (Ag), as part of the CBD, has the mission to conduct risk-based agricultural threat countermeasure development; to accelerate and expand the development of current and new medical and diagnostic countermeasures to detect, and prevent the spread of, an intentional introduction or natural occurrence of a catastrophic foreign animal, emerging, or zoonotic disease in coordination with internal and external stakeholders. The Agricultural Screening Tools Project supports the latter part of the above Ag mission.</p>
<p>The threat of terrorist or unintentionally introduction of a foreign animal, emerging, or zoonotic disease on the U.S. economy is of great concern in the United States. There are vulnerabilities that create the need to perform surveillance and monitoring of endemic and foreign animal diseases rapidly, accurately, and economically using a single diagnostic sample. Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) 9 dictates research to "expand development of common screening and inspection procedures for agriculture and food items entering the United States and to maximize effective domestic inspection activities for food items within the United States" in an effort to reduce vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>This BAA seeks to provide sound scientific techniques related to supporting development and deployment of diagnostic and screening technologies for surveillance and detection efforts to protect against any high-consequence livestock pathogens. Both laboratory based approaches and field deployable approaches will be considered although preference will be granted to field deployable solutions.</p>
<p>DHS Agricultural Defense Mission -</p>
<p>The Agricultural Defense mission is to conduct risk-based agricultural threat countermeasure development; to accelerate and expand the development of current and new medical and diagnostic countermeasures to detect, and prevent the spread of, an intentional introduction or natural occurrence of a catastrophic foreign animal, emerging, or zoonotic disease in coordination with internal and external stakeholders.</p>
<p>Agricultural Screening Tools Project Mission Distinctive -<br /><br />The mission of this project is the development of screening systems to aid in protecting the U.S. public health, food supply and livestock. Specific areas that are being addressed include: 1) veterinary medical countermeasures to detect, control, and eradicate foreign or endemic animal diseases; 2) screening tools that can be used to inspect packages or people entering the U.S. for agricultural threats. Tools developed must provide rapid detection of multiple agents prioritized as the highest risk agents for use in a national laboratory network or portable and rugged enough for use in the field by local/state/federal diagnosticians. <br />1.8.2. DHS Agricultural Screening Tools Project Objectives</p>
<p>The programmatic objectives of the Agricultural Screening Tools Project are:</p>
<p>&bull; Develop field deployable tools for early detection of agricultural threats to allow for swift decisions and quarantine <br />&bull; Transition tools for early detection of agricultural threats to allow for swift decisions and quarantine<br />&bull; Transition tools for continued syndromic surveillance of disease to allow for continuity of business <br />&bull; Enhance capabilities at the NAHLN (whose mission includes surveillance, response (surge), recovery for high consequence agricultural diseases) <br />1.8.3. Description of Technical Focus Areas (TFA)</p>
<p>The focus of this BAA is in the area of Agricultural Defense, specifically Agricultural Screening Tools (AST), for the purpose of enhancing our national security, protect agricultural infrastructure, enhance resiliency, and ensure business continuity. Agricultural screening tools (tools that can be used to detect a potential disease or condition in an animal, group of animals, or animal product that requires confirmation) must have the ability to perform surveillance and monitoring of endemic and foreign animal diseases rapidly, accurately, and economically using a single diagnostic sample is highly desirable. A multiplex approach is desirable. Further, a near term solution (12-18 months) for field deployable detection is needed. Time to detect and identify should be on the order of minutes (less than 60 minutes). Suggested target performance metrics are provided in Table 1 for a field deployable approach and Table 2 for a laboratory-based approach.</p>
<p>Table 1: Target Performance Metrics (Field deployable)<br />Cost (system/assay) &lt;$10k; $10/assay<br />Time to respond &lt;60 minutes<br />Sensitivity &gt;97%<br />Specificity &gt;97% <br />Limit of detection &le;1000TCID50 ; 1000 cfu/ml (bacteria); 1000 pfu/ml (virus) <br />Reagent stability (temp and time) 15&deg;C-30&deg;C; shelf life of at least 1 year<br />Sample Matrices<br />Oral fluids, blood, milk, meat juices, etc<br />Multiplex (Y/N, if yes, indicate highest number &amp; number capable) y/n<br />Operator Skill Level Low to moderate<br />Weight, dimensions, power options &lt;7 lbs; &lt;1 cubic ft; 110V/battery</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A truncated list of agricultural pathogens of concern is shown in Table 3. Many of these diseases are OIE reportable diseases and thus presence of these pathogens in U.S. herds would affect import and export activities, and thus have significant economic impacts. Note however that this list is not all inclusive and we will consider proposals related to other pathogens as long as presence of that pathogen stands to cause significant economic loss to the U.S. (&gt;$1B/year).</p>
<p><br />Table 3. Partial List of Diseases of Concern</p>
<p>Influenza A <br />Classical Swine Fever<br />African Swine Fever<br />Foot-and-Mouth Disease<br />Hendra<br />Nipah<br />Rift Valley Fever<br />Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome <br />Pseudorabies - including Chinese variant<br />Swine Enteric Coronavirus Disease (4 virus subtypes)<br />Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea<br />Transmissible Gastroenteritis<br />Porcine Delta-Coronavirus<br />Porcine Respiratory Coronavirus<br />Swine Brucellosis</p>
<p><br />TFA-1: Develop a pen-side agricultural screening tool. This tool needs to be simple enough to be part of the field diagnostician tool kit, easy to use and inexpensive, with minimal sample manipulation.</p>
<p>TFA-2: Develop a multiplex "syndromic surveillance" panel approach as an agricultural screening tool. This could be a laboratory based approach or a field deployable approach. Syndromic surveillance uses health-related data that precede diagnosis and signal a sufficient probability of a case or an outbreak to warrant further public health response . The regular and systematic collection, assembly and analysis of health-related data of animals in real-time would be useful for outbreak recognition and response management.</p>
<p>TFA-3: Develop singleplex and multiplex PCR methods for detection of swine diseases in oral fluids.</p>
<p>TFA-4: Develop or evaluate a commercially available transport media for safe transport and stabilization of nucleic acid (DNA/RNA) and antibodies for downstream serological testing.</p>

<p>Award type is anticipated to be in the form of Cost Reimbursement type contracts. However, the Government reserves the right to award Firm Fixed Price or Interagency Agreements (IAs) to appropriate parties should the situation warrant.</p>
<p>2.5. Anticipated Period of Performance for New Awards<br />The period of performance for research efforts and studies proposed should either be for a single period not to exceed 18 months, or for multiple years having one base phase (up to 18 months) with one year options. If a multi-year project is proposed, something of tangible value must be provided in the first funding phase. Funding in the first phase cannot be used for planning purposes, with the actual execution of the task to be performed in the subsequent year(s). Multi-year proposals should make recommendations and present a plan that sets forth the follow-on effort in the subsequent option years. Consideration of the funding of follow-on work in a subsequent year will be contingent upon the value of the product(s) produced by the first-phase effort. The period of performance shall commence at the date of award. Proposals that build on current or previous work in these areas are encouraged. If Offerors are extending work performed under other DHS projects or projects for other sponsors, the proposal must clearly identify the point of departure and what existing work will be brought forward and what new effort will be performed under this BAA. The final deliverable for an effort should be a prototype assay or system, final report or a publishable journal article manuscript that can be peer-reviewed, along with standard analytical method(s) and relevant data. <br />3. ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION</p>
<p>This BAA is open to ALL responsible sources.</p>
<p>Offerors may include single entities or teams from academia, private sector organizations, Government laboratories, and Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), including Department of Energy National Laboratories and Centers.</p>
<p>3.1. Federally Funded Research &amp; Development Centers</p>
<p>FFRDCs, including Department of Energy National Laboratories and Centers, are eligible to respond to this BAA, individually or as a team member of an eligible principal Offeror, so long as they are permitted under a sponsoring agreement between the Government and the specific FFRDC.</p>
<p><br />3.2. Nonprofit Organizations, Educational Institutions and Small Business Set Aside</p>
<p>The Government encourages nonprofit organizations, educational institutions, small businesses, small minority disadvantaged business (SDB) concerns, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), Minority Institutions (MI) (HBCU/MIs), women-owned businesses (WB), and Historically Underutilized Business (HUB) zone enterprises as well as large businesses, academic institutions, and Government laboratories to submit research proposals for consideration and/or to join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of the BAA will be set-aside for these special entities pursuant to FAR Part 19.502-2, because of the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research and development in any specific requirement area.</p>
<p>To ensure full consideration in these programs, registration in the https://baa2.st.dhs.gov/<br />website, described later in this document, requires the appropriate business type selection as well as accurate up-to-date information.</p>
<p>3.3. Organizational Conflict of Interest</p>
<p>Organizational Conflict of Interest issues will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis; as outlined below. Offers who have existing contract(s) to provide scientific, engineering, technical and/or administrative support directly to the DHS S&amp;T will receive particular scrutiny.</p>
<p>(a) Determination. The Government has determined that this effort may result in an actual or potential conflict of interest, or may provide one or more Offerors with the potential to attain an unfair competitive advantage.</p>
<p>(b) Process. If any such conflict of interest is found to exist, the Contracting Officer may (1) disqualify the Offeror, or (2) determine that it is otherwise in the best interest of the United States to contract with the Offeror and include the appropriate provisions to mitigate or avoid such conflict in the contract awarded. After discussion with the Offeror, the Contracting Officer may determine that the actual conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, mitigated, or otherwise resolved to the satisfaction of the Government, and the Offeror may be found ineligible for award.</p>
<p>(c) Disclosure: The Offeror must represent, as part of its proposal and to the best of its knowledge that: (1) It is not aware of any facts which create any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest relating to the award of this contract; or (2) It has included information in its proposal, providing all current information bearing on the existence of any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest, and has included the mitigation plan in accordance with paragraph (d) of this provision.</p>
<p>(d) Mitigation/Waiver. If an Offeror with a potential or actual conflict of interest or unfair competitive advantage believes it can be mitigated, neutralized, or avoided, the Offeror shall submit a mitigation plan to the Contracting Officer for review. Award of a contract where an actual or potential conflict of interest exists shall not occur before Government approval of the mitigation plan.</p>
<p>(e) Other Relevant Information: In addition to the mitigation plan, the Contracting Officer may require further relevant information from the Offeror. The Contracting Officer will use all information submitted by the Offeror, and any other relevant information known to DHS, to determine whether an award to the Offeror may take place, and whether the mitigation plan adequately neutralizes or mitigates the conflict.</p>
<p>(f) Corporation Change. The successful Offeror shall inform the Contracting Officer within thirty (30) calendar days of the effective date of any corporate mergers, acquisitions, and/or divestures that may affect this provision.</p>
<p>(g) Flow-down. The contractor shall insert the substance of this clause in each first tier subcontract that exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold.</p>

<p><br />5. EVALUATION INFORMATION</p>
<p>5.1. Evaluation Criteria</p>
<p>The evaluation of Full Proposals will be accomplished through an independent technical review using the following criteria. All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined are significantly more important than cost or price.</p>
<p>Criterion I: Scientific Merit: The Offeror must demonstrate understanding of the critical technology and scientific challenges required to address the desired system parameters and strategy as described elsewhere within the announcement. The research approach should be scientifically sound, practical and technically defensible. The research must contribute to scientific knowledge in the topic area and the research must enumerate potential benefits of the proposed research. The proposal shall demonstrate an awareness of the state-of-the-art. The proposal should be well-prepared with supportive information that is self-explanatory.</p>
<p>Criterion II: Sound Technical Approach: The proposed scientific/technical concept and methodology is clearly described and sound and includes a demonstrated understanding of related technology. The technical approach is innovative and/of has advantages over other solutions, if successfully implemented. Of importance is how the proposed technology will meet or exceed the performance requirements for this program. All critical scientific and technical issues clearly identified, and the planned development approach and risk mitigation efforts are clearly defined and feasible. Adherence to the performance metrics in Tables 1 and 2 will be evaluated (see Section 1.8.3).</p>
<p>Criterion III: Sound Management Approach: Presentation of a sound managerial approach to the proposed work, including a demonstrated understanding of the issues and challenges associated with achieving the goals of the topic, and a strategy to address those issues and challenges. A successful team will possess multidisciplinary expertise to address the complexity of the effort.</p>
<p>Criterion IV: Capability to Perform and History of Past Performance: Demonstration of a capability to perform the proposed work, including history of previous performance in developing related solutions and technologies. Proposals that utilize industry-academic partnering or utilize industry-Government partnering which enhances the development of novel S&amp;T advances will be given favorable consideration. Specific considerations will include:</p>
<p>- Offeror's knowledge of the state-of-the-art diagnostic detection systems in human or veterinary medicine and ability to work across domains to solve a research question<br />- Offeror's team is sufficiently complete: key personnel are identified with the required range of competencies to execute the effort and the team includes appropriate experience<br />- Offeror has experience in working with Transboundary Animal Diseases (TADs)<br />- Offeror has experience working with biological pathogens ( list specifically by agent)</p>
<p>- Offeror and/or Third party test reports showing past experience in development of screening tools for pathogens (preferably Ag assays and publication grade format)</p>
<p>- Offeror is able to perform laboratory experiments on pathogens of interest or surrogates or has partnerships with other institutions where such work can be completed</p>
<p>Criterion V: Cost Realism: Presentation of accurate, well-founded and reasonable estimates of all costs related to performance of the proposed effort, including an appropriate allocation of labor resources. Members of the Evaluation panel will be looking for overall best value to the government.</p>
<p>Evaluation of Full Proposals will be based on an assessment of the overall best value to the government based on the aforementioned criteria. Awards will be made based upon Full Proposal evaluation, funds availability, and other programmatic considerations, including awards to lesser rated proposals where orthogonal or alternative approaches and technologies are deemed to be more technically advantageous.</p>
<p>NOTE: DHS S&amp;T reserves the right to select for award and fund all, some, or none of the Full Proposals received in response to this announcement.</p>
<p>5.2. Evaluation Panel</p>
<p>S&amp;T's policy is to ensure an impartial, equitable, and comprehensive evaluation of all proposals and to select the source (or combination of sources) whose offer is most advantageous to the government. All properly submitted Full Proposals that conform to the BAA requirements will be evaluated by a review panel comprised of Government and non-Government technical experts drawn from staff within DHS S&amp;T, other Federal agencies and subject matter experts from Contractor support personnel. All Government personnel are bound by public law to protect proprietary information. Further, Contractor personnel will be used to handle the submissions administratively and may serve as non-voting technical advisors. Contractor personnel who will have access to any proprietary data will be bound by appropriate non-disclosure agreements to protect proprietary and source-selection information and shall certify that they have no financial interest in any submissions evaluated. They will not be permitted to release any source-selection information to third parties, including others in their organization. Contractors will serve as non-voting members of the Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB). Submissions and information received in response to this BAA constitute permission to disclose that information to certified evaluators under these conditions.</p>

Each Offeror must provide a very specific description of any equipment or hardware it needs to acquire to perform the work. This description should indicate whether or not each particular piece of equipment or hardware will be included as part of a deliverable item under the resulting award.</p>
<p>In addition, this description should identify the component, nomenclature, and configuration of the equipment or hardware that it proposes to purchase for this effort. The Government wants to have the contractor purchase the equipment or hardware for deliverable items under its contract. It will evaluate case-by-case the purchase, on a direct reimbursement basis, of special test equipment or other equipment, not included in a deliverable item will be evaluated for allowability on a case-by-case basis. Maximum use of Government integration, test, and experiment facilities is encouraged in each of the Offeror's proposals.</p>
<p>Government research facilities may be available, and should be considered as potential GFE. These facilities and resources are of high value, and some are in constant demand by multiple programs. The use of these facilities and resources will be negotiated as the program unfolds. Offerors should explain which of these facilities they recommend and why.</p>
<p>If any prototype, instrument or device is produced during the period of performance of a funded project, a sample shall be delivered to DHS S&amp;T CBD before the end of the period of performance for demonstration purposes. More specific information about the provision of a sample(s) will be incorporated in the Statement of Work.</p>
<p>7.2. SAFETY Act</p>
<p>As part of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Congress enacted the Support Anti- Terrorism by Fostering Effective Technologies Act of 2002 (the "SAFETY Act"). The SAFETY Act puts limitations on the potential liability of firms that develop and provide qualified anti-terrorism technologies. DHS S&amp;T, acting through its Office of SAFETY Act Implementation (OSAI), encourages the development and deployment of anti-terrorism technologies by making available the SAFETY Act's system of "risk management" and "liability management." Offerors submitting proposals in response to this BAA are encouraged to submit SAFETY Act applications for their existing technologies. They are invited to contact OSAI for more information, at 1-866-788-9318 or helpdesk@safetyact.gov. They also can visit OSAI's Web site at www.safetyact.gov.</p>
<p><br />7.3. Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) Compliance Documentation</p>
<p>Those Offerors whose Full Proposals are selected for funding, will be provided two forms which will need to be completed and expeditiously returned to the Agricultural Screening Tools Project Office. Blank forms will be provided with the letter confirming selection of the proposal. These forms consist of the following:</p>
<p>&bull; BWC Treaty Compliance Project Summary Form<br />&bull; Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) Checklist</p>
<p>7.4. Export Control Considerations</p>
<p>International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) may apply to one or more of the topics in this BAA. Foreign nationals must meet the requirements for participation set by those regulations, if required.</p>
<p>7.5. Security Classification</p>
<p>No Classified Project Description Forms or Full Proposals (or portions of proposals) will be accepted.</p>
<p>7.6. Information for Full Proposal Respondents</p>
<p>This BAA seeks to solicit sound scientific studies and techniques to address the DHS Agricultural Screening Tools project objectives set forth in Section 1.8.2 and technical focus areas set forth in Section 1.8.3. It will not be construed as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this BAA and the Government's use of such information. Respondents to this BAA may be requested to provide additional information based on their submittals. Unnecessarily elaborate responses containing extensive marketing materials are not desired.</p>
<p>7.7. Subcontracting Plan</p>
<p>Successful contract proposals that exceed $650,000.00, submitted by all but small business concerns, will be required to submit a Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with FAR 52.219-9, prior to award.</p>
<p>&emsp;<br />7.8. Additional Deliverables</p>
<p>Performers should define additional program-specific deliverables as appropriate for the proposed approach. The Government may describe additional deliverables at the time full proposals are requested.</p>
<p>It is desired, whenever possible, that final reports be in a format that is publishable in appropriate scientific journals so that peer review can be conducted.</p>
<p>7.9. Reporting</p>
<p>The following minimum deliverables will be required under traditional procurement Contracts awarded to those Offerors who are selected for award.</p>
<p>Monthly Project Status Reports</p>
<p>Reports of project status will be solicited on a monthly basis from all performers. These reports will be electronically submitted to the Program Manager within fifteen days after the last day of each month. The Monthly Project Status Report should be in a standardized format to collect the following information:</p>
<p>Static Information (Information that does not change monthly over the project): <br />&bull; Project Title<br />&bull; DHS Project Control #<br />&bull; Period of Performance<br />&bull; Principal Investigator's Name, Telephone Number, E-mail and Unclassified/Secure Facsimile Number(s)<br />&bull; Performer's Financial Contact Name and Telephone Number</p>
<p>Monthly Update Information To Be Provided in Bulleted or Short Narrative Format:<br />&bull; Activity During the Past Reporting Period (month)<br />&bull; Progress Achieved Against Deliverable(s) During Reporting Period<br />&bull; Progress Achieved Against Project Milestones and Tasks During Reporting Period<br />&bull; Deliverables Submitted This Period<br />&bull; Milestones Reached/Achieved This Period<br />&bull; Other Noteworthy Accomplishments (Meetings, Presentations, Publications, etc.)<br />&bull; Topics of Concern/Slippage (Technical, Schedule and/or Cost)<br />&bull; Recovery Plan (if needed)<br />&bull; Explicit Plans for Next Month<br />&bull; Project Budget Information (Amount Spent During Reporting Period, Cumulative Amount Spent Since Project Inception, and Amount of Funding Remaining)</p>
<p>Performers are requested to provide monthly update information only in those sections of the form that are applicable to the activities performed during the reporting period. If there is no updated information to report in a section, it can be marked "N/A" for Not Applicable, or left blank.</p>
<p>The following deliverables, primarily in contractor format, are anticipated as necessary. However, specific deliverables should be proposed by each Offeror and finalized with the contracting agent:</p>
<p>&bull; Monthly Progress Status Reports<br />&bull; Presentation Materials<br />&bull; Other Documents or Reports<br />&bull; Final Report (suitable for publishing and peer review)</p>
<p>7.10. Project Conferences, Meetings and Reviews</p>
<p>The Agricultural Screening Tools Project schedules monthly telephone conferences in which all performers are encouraged to participate. Matters of general interest to the performers are provided on agendas that are e-mailed to the performers along with dial-in instructions for access to a toll-free telephone bridge. Those issues that are relevant only to one performer or proprietary in nature are discussed in separate telephone conferences between the performer and the Agricultural Screening Tools Project office staff.</p>
<p>Program status reviews may also be held to provide a forum for reviews of the latest results from experiments and any other incremental progress towards the deliverables and major demonstrations. These meetings will be held at various sites throughout the country. For costing purposes, Offerors should assume that one of these one-day meetings will be at or near DHS S&amp;T, Washington D.C., and one other meeting will be held at the contractor's facility or a near-by government facility.</p>
<p>7.11. Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data</p>
<p>Successful contract proposals that exceed $700,000.00 may require the submission of a Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data in accordance with FAR 15.403-4(b)(2), prior to award.</p>
<p>7.12. Test and Evaluation Facilities</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security Science &amp; Technology Directorate may make available appropriate test and evaluation facilities to support this program. Offerors should provide any specific requirements needed for test and evaluation of their proposed concept in their proposals.</p>
<p>7.13. Hazardous Materials</p>
<p>Depending on the topic, Offeror may choose to or be required to utilize hazardous materials during the course of the project development effort. If the government provides hazardous samples as part of the developmental and operational testing, information on the samples will be provided to the successful Offerors requiring such samples.</p>
<p>Hazardous material, as used here, includes any material defined as hazardous under the latest version of Federal Standard No. 313 (including revisions adopted during the term of the contract). If the successful Offerors choose to use their own hazardous samples, Offerors must meet the requirements for the identification and material safety as follows:</p>
<p>HAZARDOUS MATERIAL IDENTIFICATION AND MATERIAL SECURITY<br />DATA</p>
<p>(a) "Hazardous material," as used in this clause, includes any material defined as hazardous under the latest version of Federal Standard No. 313 (including revisions adopted during the term of the contract).</p>
<p>(b) The Offeror must list any hazardous material, as defined in paragraph (a) of this clause, to be delivered under this contract. The hazardous material shall be properly identified and include any applicable identification number, such as National Stock Number or Special Item Number. This information shall also be included on the Material Safety Data Sheet submitted under this contract.</p>
<p>Material (If none, insert "None") Identification No.<br />________________ __________________<br />____________________ __________________<br />____________________ __________________</p>
<p>(c) This list must be updated during performance of the contract whenever the Contractor determines that any other material to be delivered under this contract is hazardous.</p>
<p>(d) The apparently successful Offeror agrees to submit, for each item as required prior to award, a Material Safety Data Sheet, meeting the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.1200(g) and the latest version of Federal Standard No. 313, for all hazardous material identified in paragraph (b) of this clause. Data shall be submitted in accordance with Federal Standard No. 313, whether or not the apparently successful Offeror is the actual manufacturer of these items. Failure to submit the Material Safety Data Sheet prior to award may result in the apparently successful Offeror being considered nonresponsible and ineligible for award.</p>
<p>(e) If, after award, there is a change in the composition of the item(s) or a revision to Federal Standard No. 313, which renders incomplete or inaccurate the data submitted under paragraph (d) of this clause, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer and resubmit the data.</p>
<p>(f) Neither the requirements of this clause nor any act or failure to act by the Government shall relieve the Contractor of any responsibility or liability for the safety of Government, Contractor, or subcontractor personnel or property.</p>
<p>(g) Nothing contained in this clause shall relieve the Contractor from complying with applicable Federal, State, and local laws, codes, ordinances, and regulations (including the obtaining of licenses and permits) in connection with hazardous material.</p>
<p>(h) The Government's rights in data furnished under this contract with respect to hazardous material are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) To use, duplicate and disclose any data to which this clause is applicable. The purposes of this right are to-<br />(i) Apprise personnel of the hazards to which they may be exposed in using, handling, packaging, transporting, or disposing of hazardous materials;<br />(ii) Obtain medical treatment for those affected by the material; and<br />(iii) Have others use, duplicate, and disclose the data for the Government for these purposes.<br />(2) To use, duplicate, and disclose data furnished under this clause, in accordance with paragraph (h) (1) of this clause, in precedence over any other clause of this contract providing for rights in data.<br />(3) The Government is not precluded from using similar or identical data acquired from other sources.</p>
<p>(i) Except as provided in paragraph (i)(2), the Contractor shall prepare and submit a sufficient number of Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS's), meeting the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.1200(g) and the latest version of Federal Standard No. 313, for all hazardous materials identified in paragraph (b) of this clause.</p>
<p>(1) For items shipped to consignees, the Contractor shall include a copy of the MSDS's with the packing list or other suitable shipping document which accompanies each shipment. Alternatively, the Contractor is permitted to transmit MSDS's to consignees in advance of receipt of shipments by consignees, if authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer.<br />(2) For items shipped to consignees identified by mailing address as agency depots, distribution centers or customer supply centers, the Contractor shall provide one copy of the MSDS's in or on each shipping container. If affixed to the outside of each container, the MSDS's must be placed in a weather resistant envelope.</p>
<p>7.14 AQD Greening Clause</p>
<p>A) Almost every service requires the use of some sort of product. While providing services pursuant to the Requirements Document in this contract, if your services necessitate the acquisition of any products, the contractor shall use its best efforts to comply with Executive Order 13514, and to acquire the environmentally preferable products that meet the requirements of clauses at FAR 52.223-2, Affirmative Procurement of Biobased Products under Service and Construction Contracts, 52.223-15, Energy Efficiency in Energy Consuming Products, and 52.223-17 Affirmative Procurement of EPA-Designated Items in Service and Construction Contracts. <br />B) Additionally, the contractor shall use its best efforts to reduce the generation of paper documents through the use of double-sided printing, double sided copying, and the use and purchase of 30% post consumer content white paper to meet the intent of FAR 52.204-4 Printed or Copied Double-Sided on Postconsumer Fiber Content Paper.</p>

<p><strong><br />II. BACKGROUND<br /></strong><br />Radiotherapy is an important part of the treatment of unresectable pancreatic cancer. Although older trials were inconsistent, a recent ECOG Phase 3 trial showed a survival advantage to the combination of radiotherapy and gemcitabine over gemcitabine alone (Loehrer 2011). The study was closed early because of slow accrual; however, in the 74 patients enrolled, median survival improved from 9.2 to 11.1 months (p=0.017). These results, together with the recent recognition that uncontrolled local growth is the cause of death in 30% of patients (Iacobuzio-Donahue et al., 2009) lend support to the notion that survival may be improved in some patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer through intensification of local therapy.<br /><br />Previous attempts to escalate the radiation dose to pancreatic tumors, with or without chemotherapy, have been limited by severe toxicity. Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) can reduce the radiation dose to Organs-At-Risk and simultaneously allow an increase in target dose in this patient population (Spalding 2007). IMRT was used in a phase I/II trial (Ben-Josef 2012) at the University of Michigan to escalate the dose from 50 to 60 Gy in 25 fractions delivered concurrently with full-dose gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2 weekly on weeks 1, 2, 4, and 5 of radiotherapy). Dose-limiting toxicity was defined as Grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicity, neutropenic fever/infection, or substantial deterioration (to Zubrod &ge;3) of performance status, occurring between day 1 and 126. The trial accrued 50 patients and established that high-dose radiotherapy (55 Gy in 25 fractions) can be delivered safely with concurrent full-dose gemcitabine, with the use of IMRT. The rate of severe toxicity (24%) observed at this dose compares favorably with toxicities reported with other contemporaneous regimens. There were also encouraging signals of efficacy. The median and 2-year survival in this trial (14.8 months and 30%, respectively) are significantly better than historical controls (11.2 months and 13%, respectively) (Murphy et al 2007). These results also compare favorably to other contemporary phase II and III trials in this patient population, with either 5-FU based- or gemcitabine-based platform. High-dose radiotherapy also improved the 2-year local control from 38% (historical controls, Murphy et al 2007) to 59%. Most importantly, 12 of 50 patients (24%) receiving high-dose radiotherapy were able to undergo resection with good outcomes; 10 patients (83%) had R0 resection and 5 patients (42%) had a major pathological response. The median survival in these patients was 32 months.<br /><br />Particle radiation therapy offers advantageous physical dose distribution (protons and heavy-ion particles) and biological characteristics (heavy-ion particles) as compared to photon radiotherapy. Such charged-particle beams have the physical advantage in that they stop at a depth defined by their energy and thereby spare normal tissues from unwanted radiation. And, while there is still a pressing need for more extensive clinical trials to determine appropriate and optimal use of particle therapy, a considerable body of experimental and treatment-based evidence indicates that particle beams might be as or more effective in treating cancer as the most sophisticated photon-based therapies while definitely reducing the normal tissue irradiated. Because of the physical stopping of protons and other heavy-ion particles at well-defined depth in the tissue, particle beam treatments may target tumors from a single or just a few directions which can be chosen to avoid the most sensitive tissues/organs. Due to the limited volume of tissue irradiated and concomitant reduced risk for the development of radiation-associated site effects, patients with lung cancer and cancers of the head and neck, brain, base of skull, eye, pancreas, and prostate stand to benefit from the advantages of particle beam therapy. In addition to advantageous physical characteristics, heavier-ion particle (most commonly carbon ions) beams produce unique biological effects in tissues. First, radiobiological experiments show that hypoxic tumor cells - the most radiation resistant and aggressive tumor cells - are killed more efficiently with heavy-ion beams than with photons or protons. Second, such particle beams provide a unique advantage of higher biological effectiveness, resulting in more damage to the irradiated tissue per unit of radiation dose delivered to the target volume (at the Bragg pick) as compared to that inflicted in traversed normal tissues. Therefore, radiation resistant tumors, hypoxic tumors could be efficiently eradicated by carbon ion beams without significant collateral damage to normal tissues. Recently, NIRS (Japan) reported that after carbon ion radiotherapy plus chemotherapy of locally advanced pancreatic cancer the 2-year survival rate was 54% (personal communication). Those data were reviewed during visits to NIRS by investigators from the Mayo Clinic and the GI committee of NRG and found to be credible.<br /><br />These data indicate that CIRT can be delivered safely and results in encouraging local control rates and OS. Furthermore, it strongly suggests that survival can be extended in some patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer through improvement in local control and prevention or delay of local complications, which lead to death.<br /><strong><br />III. TECHNICAL OBJECTIVES<br /></strong><br />The overall objective of this BAA is to conduct a definitive randomized phase 3 clinical trial of carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) vs. 3D conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) for unresectable pancreatic cancer. The clinically relevant outcomes of this trial shall also be indirectly compared to those of parallel trial, RTOG1201, carried out by NRG Oncology (http://www.nrgoncology.org/), a member organization of the NCI Clinical Trials Network (NCTN, http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/nctn).</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide essential clinical trials infrastructure and laboratory support to carry out and assess the outcome of randomized clinical trial according to the specific research protocol, to be developed by the Contractor. The Contractor shall have the capacity to perform studies using both CIRT and 3D-CRT. The goals of the program are:</p>
<p>1. To conduct a randomized clinical trial necessary to assess the value of CIRT for unresectable pancreatic cancer as directly compared to 3D-CRT.</p>
<p>2. To enable indirect comparison of this trial outcome to the outcome of the IMRT vs. 3D-CRT trial carried out by NRG Oncology (RTOG1201).</p>
<p>To meet the objectives of this acquisition, the contractor shall:</p>
<p>1. Set up the infrastructure, with the appropriate number and mix of clinical, laboratory, and support personnel, to conduct a definitive randomized clinical trial comparing 3D-CRT and CIRT as described in the Protocol.<br /><br />2. Establish collaboration and maintain very close communication throughout with NRG Oncology in order to ensure comparability of the control (3D-RT arm of the CIRT trial with RTOG1201) and to enable indirect comparisons between the two investigational radiation treatment modalities being studied: IMRT and CIRT.<br /><br />3. Recruit patients for the clinical trial to assess the potential of CIRT, according to the protocol.<br /><br />4. Follow each subject until death or for a minimum of 2 years.<br /><br />5. Conduct studies in compliance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines and other regulatory requirements governing the safe conduct of research involving human subjects.<br /><br />6. Obtain and process biospecimens as described in the protocol. Guidelines to be followed can be found at: http://biospecimens.cancer.gov/bestpractices/2011-NCIBestPractices.pdf</p>
<p><strong><br />NOTE:</strong> Organizations responding to this BAA must have documented expertise in clinical research and clinical research in the patient population proposed or in the type of study proposed, and demonstrated knowledge of applicable regulatory guidelines.</p>

It is the responsibility of the interested contractors to obtain copies of the necessary provisions and clauses that are required as a part of this solicitation. Required clauses/provisions that are not submitted may render a quote not to be accepted by the Government.
 

The following provisions and clauses are applicable: 

52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORSCOMMERICAL ITEMS (JUN 2008)

1.0 GENERAL PROPOSAL INSTRUCTIONS
The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation in accordance with FAR 15.101-2 Lowest Price Technically Acceptable Source Selection Process, price and other factors considered.

Offerors shall prepare a quote as set forth below. Elaborate brochures or documentation, binding, detailed artwork, or other embellishments are unnecessary and are not desired. Failure of a quote to comply with these instructions may be grounds for exclusion of the quote from further consideration.

Quote shall include the following information:

1.
 Technical Capability
2. Past Performance
3. Pricing

In addition the contractor shall provide the following:
Completed Certifications and Representations (unless current ORCA information is adequate).
Completed Certification under FAR Clause 52.222-48

Each of the parts shall be separate and complete in itself so that evaluation of one may be accomplished independently from evaluation of the other. 

Submit offers via NECO or email to Alan Gonzales who can be reached via email at alan.gonzales@navy.mil. It is the contractors responsibility to confirm receipt of proposal.

Each Offeror must submit an offer (quote) in accordance with the instructions herein. When evaluating an Offeror, the Government will consider how well the Offeror complied with both the letter and spirit of these instructions.
 The Government will consider any failure on the part of an Offeror to comply with the letter and spirit of these instructions to be an indication of the type of conduct it can expect during contract performance. Therefore, Offerors are encouraged to contact the Contract Specialist at alan.gonzales@navy.mil to request an explanation of any aspect of these instructions.

Clarity and completeness of the quote are of the utmost importance. The quote must be written in a practical, clear, and concise manner. It must use quantitative terms whenever possible and must avoid qualitative adjectives to the maximum extent possible. Quotes must be internally consistent or the quotes will be considered unrealistic and may be considered unacceptable.

At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate quotes and award a contract without discussions with offerors.
 Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offerors best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.

Alternate quotes are not authorized and will be rejected.

The quote shall present evidence of the Offerors understanding of the requirements and their interrelationships. The quote shall demonstrate the Offerors familiarity with the detailed aspects of the requirements, and shall clearly show that the Offeror correctly interpreted all of the requirements. Responses must adequately address specific solicitation requirements. Statements such as the Offeror understands, and the Offeror shall/can comply, along with responses that paraphrase the RFP, are inadequate. The use of phrases such as standard practices (with a specific Government reference or industry reference) is unacceptable.
 Quotes submitted in response to this solicitation shall contain the information specified within this provision. Offerors are cautioned to not simply restate the Performance Work Statement in their technical proposal. 

At the Governments discretion, the Contractors quote may be incorporated into the final award document.

Each initial offer should contain the Offerors best terms from a price and technical standpoint.
 It is the Offerors responsibility to ensure that there are no discrepancies presented within the information contained in its offer.

No cost or pricing information shall be included in any part of the Technical Volume. The Government requires the information described below in order to evaluate the offerors ability to perform. Failure to adequately address any of the required information may constitute a material omission, precluding further consideration for award.

The Offerors Technical Proposal (Volume I) should be organized in a manner to permit evaluation of each of the factors and subfactors and with respect to their relative importance specified in this solicitation, Section M  Evaluation Factors for Award.
 Offerors must demonstrate the ability to meet all of the requirements set forth in the solicitation. 

Technical Capability will consist of three (3) sub-factors:
1. Technical Approach
2. Resumes
3. Mangement/Staffing

Sub-Factor (1) Technical Approach. The offeror shall provide details regarding the specific technical and analytical methods that would be used to provide the services as defined in the PWS. The technical approach should demonstrate that the Offeror can accomplish the specified work in a technically competent, timely, cost effective manner with a minimum of risk to the Government. The narrative should provide a complete analysis of the performance requirements and explain the processes, and best practices the Offeror will use to meet each requirement stated in the PWS.

Resumes shall be included for the one key personnel: SharePoint Engineer/Developer/Web Developer. The list shall also identify the labor category to which each individual is assigned and the degree of involvement (full time or part time and percentage). The list shall further identify which personnel are currently on the Offerors payroll, which are currently on a proposed subcontractors payroll, and which have been offered and have accepted employment contingent on award of this Purchase Order (prime and subcontractor).
 For each person proposed who is not currently on the contractor or subcontractors payroll, the Offeror shall provide a signed Letter of Intent with the individuals resume.

The Navy will rate the quality of personnel proposed for the 1 key position. Quality of the personnel proposed will be determined by the Navys evaluation of resumes submitted in terms of the merit of the individuals qualifications and any relevant information obtained from review of Government Past Performance reports. This information will be compared to solicitation requirements. 

Resumes should not exceed two pages in length. Resumes shall be grouped by labor category. 

Each resume shall provide the following information:
--Name;

If the Offeror proposed personnel from a different labor category as listed below (for both key and non-key), or by a different title, a cross reference list is required to be provided in the Offerors proposal justifying the submission. The justification should clearly state the basis for the deviation and rationale supporting the deviation. 

a. SharePoint Engineer/Developer/Web Developer; Key Personnel
Security Clearance: Secret level clearance at the time of awards.
Minimum Experience Requirements: See Section 7 of the PWS.

Sub-Factor (2) Mangement/Staffing Plan.
 Management/Staffing Plan will describe how the Offeror will assign personnel to meet the PWS requirements. Management/Staffing Plan will address the following areas: Reporting chain of command; Methods for overall supervision and immediate supervision at the work areas, to include the ability to staff/manage fluctuating manning requirements for the data historian; how positions and skill-sets, will support tasks identified in PWS.

Volume II  Past Performance 
Offerors shall submit a maximum of 3 past performance references. Past Performance shall be evaluated based on the submission of past performance data supplied by the Offeror, the Governments verification of that data (including information separately provided), and review of any other pertinent information.
 Offerors shall contact their past performance references and request that each reference complete a Past Performance Information Form provided as attachment (2).
 
Completed Past Performance Information Form shall be included in Volume II of the Contractors proposal. Past Performance reference submissions received after the proposal due date and time will NOT be considered. The past performance information shall consist of no more than 6 pages total. 

The Government shall evaluate the Offerors past performance performed within the past five years which is similar in scope, magnitude, and complexity to that detailed in the Performance Work Statement. Offerors who present similar contracts should provide a detailed explanation demonstrating the relevance of the contracts or efforts to the requirements of the solicitation.
 Offerors may submit performance data regarding current contract performance as long as a minimum of one year of performance has been completed as of the closing date of this solicitation. 

The offeror may also submit information regarding relevant contracts performed by any subcontractors and teaming partners who will perform under this contract. In such a case, the offeror must also clearly indicate the percentage of work that the subcontractor will perform under the contract and the work effort. Past performance will be evaluated as a teaming effort.

If the Offeror possesses no relevant past performance, it must affirmatively state this fact in the Past Performance Information Form. Each Offeror shall demonstrate relevant past performance or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant past performance.
 If the Offeror does neither of the foregoing, the proposal may not be eligible for award. 

Volume III  Price.
Offerors shall provide sufficiently detailed information to ensure a fair and reasonable determination of the proposed offer. Price analysis will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(b).

All price spreadsheets must be in excel format and not in .pdf or read-only format. The use of macro
commands is neither desired nor encouraged. Contractor price spreadsheets are to be included in one
work file to alleviate the need to combine, add, or transfer data from different work files. Excel files
should include equations used for calculations. There is no page limit for price information.

For purposes of the evaluation of price reasonableness, Labor and Travel Other Direct Costs (ODCs) shall be clearly broken out as separately identifiable items.
 A summary of the total price proposal shall also be provided.

Where a proposed price is based on a percentage of another price, an explanation must be provided, describing clearly the percentage used and the base to which it is applied.
 If the Offeror utilized additional spreadsheets to build CLIN pricing, these spreadsheets should be submitted as part of the Offerors worksheet.

Table L-1. Labor Hours  Historical Average (Labor Category  Hours)
SharePoint Engineer/Developer/Web Developer  1920 Hours


PRICING

Pricing shall include detailed price breakdown with all supporting documentation. The pricing information shall support the technical offer. 


Evaluation Criteria:
The award resulting from this solicitation will be a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Purchase Order. The Purchase Order will consist of a one-year, 12 month period. The government plans to award the purchase order on the basis of a competitive Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) procurement.
 

To be eligible for award, the Offeror must fully comply with the instructions and sufficiently address all solicitation requirements. As such, offers that take exception to any term or condition of this solicitation, propose any additional term or condition, or omit any required information, may not be considered for award. Alternate proposals are NOT authorized and will be rejected. 

To be considered eligible for award, each Offeror must submit a single proposal that contains a complete and accurate response to the requirements of this solicitation. The Government will accept only one offer. No multiple awards will be made.

Any inconsistency, within the price proposal or between the technical or price proposals, should be fully explained, or it may be considered a discrepancy within the offer and a risk in the Offerors ability to perform, which will lower the evaluation rating.
 The proposal(s) shall be in the format prescribed by, and shall contain a response to each of the areas identified in Section L entitled Instructions for Preparation of Proposals. Offers will be evaluated on each of the following evaluation factors in descending order of importance:

Factor I - Technical Capabilities
Factor II - Past Performance 
Factor III - Price 

Factor I, Technical Capabilities and Factor II Past Performance when combined are equal to Factor III Price. The subfactors in Technical Capabilities are each weighted equally.

Factor I - Technical Capability, will be evaluated based on two (2) subfactors. 

1. Technical Approach
2. Management/Staffing Plan

Factor I Technical Capability Grading Criteria:
TECHNICAL CAPABILITY TO PERFORM, Factor I, represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.
 Offerors technical information will be used to determine whether the services proposed meet the specifications included in this solicitation. Services offered, as provided in Offerors technical information, will be evaluated as technically acceptable or technically unacceptable. Offers which are determined to be technically unacceptable will not be considered further for award. 

The narrative description of each grade follows, as appropriate for Factor I, Technical Capability. 

Technical. The term technical, as used herein, refers to non-price factors other than past performance. The purpose of the technical factor is to assess whether the offerors proposal will satisfy the Governments minimum requirements.
 The Technical Evaluation Team shall evaluate the offerors proposal against these requirements as defined in the Performance Work Statement to determine whether the proposal is acceptable or unacceptable, using the ratings and descriptions outlined in Table M-1.

TABLE M-1 COMBINED TECHNICAL/RISK RATING 
Rating Description

Acceptable Proposal meets requirements and indicates an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements. 

Unacceptable Proposal does not meet requirements and contains one or more deficiencies. Proposal is unacceptable. 


Factor II: Past Performance Ratings: 
The past performance evaluation rating is an assessment of the offerors probability of meeting the minimum past performance solicitation requirements.
 This assessment is based on the offerors record of relevant and recent past performance information that pertain to the products and/or services outlined in the solicitation requirements.
The Past Performance Evaluation will evaluate whether the offerors present/past performance is relevant or not relevant to the effort to be acquired. The criteria to establish what is recent and relevant shall be unique to each source selection. Therefore, the solicitation shall establish the criteria for recency and relevancy in relation to the specific requirement being procured. In establishing what is relevant for the acquisition, consideration should be given to what aspects of an offerors contract history would give the most confidence that the offeror will satisfy the current procurement.
 In addition, the Past Performance Evaluation is to determine how well the contractor performed on the contracts. The past performance evaluation performed in support of a current source selection does not establish, create, or change the existing record and history of the offerors past performance on past contracts; rather, the past performance evaluation process gathers information from customers on how well the offeror performed those past contracts. 
Sources of Past Performance Information for Evaluation are as follows: 
 Past performance information may be provided by the offeror, as solicited. 
 Past performance information may be obtained from questionnaires tailored to the circumstances of the acquisition.
 
 Past performance information shall be obtained from any other sources available to the Government, to include, but not limited to, the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS), or other databases; interviews with Program Managers, Contracting Officers, and Fee Determining Officials; and the Defense Contract Management Agency.
The evaluation team will review this past performance information and determine the quality and usefulness as it applies to performance competence assessment. The Past Performance Evaluation will consist of one rating. 
Past performance will be rated on an acceptable or unacceptable basis using the ratings in Table M-2.



TABLE M-2 PAST PERFORMANCE RATING

Rating Definition

Acceptable Based on the offerors performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offerors performance record is unknown.
 (See note below.)

Unacceptable Based on the offerors performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.


Note: In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, unknown shall be considered acceptable.

Factor III  Price 
Price analysis will be used to determine the total evaluated price to support the selection of the lowest priced, technically acceptable offeror.
 The Offerors proposed price will be evaluated in accordance with FAR Part 15.404-1(b) price analysis procedures.

<DESC>The purpose of USAID's "Adaptasi Perubahan Iklim dan Ketangguhan (APIK)" Project is to improve the ability of Indonesians to manage climate and disaster risk. Indonesia is highly vulnerable to both climate change and a wide range of weather-related natural disasters. Given Indonesia's economic growth and settlement patterns, disaster-related economic losses and loss of life will likely have an even larger negative impact on human development in the future, particularly for the poorest and most vulnerable. Therefore, a transformation is needed in the way climate and disaster risks are presently addressed; namely, both the public and private sectors in Indonesia must move to systematically integrate climate change adaptation (CCA) and disaster risk reduction (DRR) into their investments and planning processes.
<p>This procurement is being conducted through full and open competition for which the procedures set forth in FAR Part 15 shall apply.</p>
<p>Proposals will be accepted from U.S. or non-U.S. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs), private, for-profit and non-profit organizations, including universities, research organizations, professional associations, and relevant special interest associations. In support of the Agency's interest in expanding the number and sustainability of development partners, USAID encourages proposals from potential new partners. USAID plans to award a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) completion-type contract, with a total estimated cost in the range of $18 to $20 million, covering a total estimated period of five years.</p>

The objective of FLS is to be responsive to the needs of the user agencies by providing a quality work product in a timely fashion.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District has issued a solicitation set aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) for Invitation for Bid (IFB) for Barnes Building Roof Repairs in Boston, MA. This was previously pre-solicited against solicitation number W912Wj-14-B-0009 which has expired/is archived and unavailable.
<p>The NAICS code for this procurement is 238160.</p>
<p>The estimated construction cost is between $100,000 and $500,000.00. The project is <br />planned to be issued on or about April 2014.</p>
<p>The building is a 58,000 square foot, 10-story office building in a dense urban area exposed to coastal storms and high winds. The existing roofing system is a fully adhered Ethylene-Propylene-Diene-Monomer (EPDM) system which has been damaged during recent storm events, including Hurricane Sandy. Damages include partial separation of the EPDM from insulation substrates, partial separation of the EPDM from the perimeter parapet wall, water penetration below the EPDM into insulation layers, and other damages and general age deterioration. High wind events have caused the EPDM to balloon over large areas of the roof, worsening existing deterioration, and threatening to completely separate the EPDM from substrate material,creating a potential hazard in adjacent areas.</p>
<p>Specific work tasks are intended to reconstruct severely deteriorated areas of the roof and to secure the remaining existing EPDM and substrate materials in place. These tasks include: full depth roof repair (new insulation and EPDM) in limited areas (approximately 1250 SF), reattachment of the EPDM to the perimeter parapet wall, caulking, and installing a sandbag ballast and wrap and tie system at selected locations on the roof.</p>
<p>The logistics are a consideration for this project since it is located in the city of Boston. Traffic control and pedestrian traffic control will be necessary, with the possibility of shutdown of the street. The building has limited access for large <br />equipment on multiple sides of the building. The building is adjacent with another large high-rise building which is separated by a narrow alley. The building and adjacent parking lots will be occupied during the construction contract. A staging area adjacent to the building will be made available to the Contractor.</p>
<p>This is a sealed bid solicitation. Neither telephonic, mailed nor faxed requests for hard copies of this solicitation will be accepted. <br />The solicitation will only be available online; in order to download the solicitation, offerors must access the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.fbo.gov). All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the New England District. Additional questions may be emailed to the Contract Specialist at douglas.r.raney@usace.army.mil.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

The contractor shall comply with all Federal, State, and Local regulations</p>
<p>This RFQ document and all incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-78, published 26 Dec 2014.</p>

<p>Delivery Address:</p>
<p>United States Marine Corps<br />ATTN: Sarah Alsip <br />3025 John Quick Road<br />Quantico, VA 22134</p>
<p>The closing date and time for quote submission is: 30 April 2015, 10:00am, EST. Offers received after this date and time will be considered non-responsive and will not be given further consideration. Please provide all submissions to Government Point of Contact: Teri Bischof, teri.bischof@usmc.mil.</p>
<p>All contractors must comply with the requirement listed above for this request. Failure to comply may result in disqualification. This will be a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) order.</p>
<p>This acquisition will utilize Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) procedures in accordance with FAR 15.101-2. Technical tradeoff will not be made and no additional credit will be given for exceeding acceptability. Award will be made to the acceptable offeror with the lowest evaluated price, which is deemed responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation and whose quote conforms to the solicitation requirements. The solicitation requirements include all stated terms, conditions, representation and certifications, and other information required by this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined necessary by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Government may reject any quote that is evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of requirements, contract terms and conditions, or an unrealistically high or low price when compared to Government estimates, such that the quote is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risk of the program.</p>
<p>Technical acceptability will be evaluated on all quotes. Only those quotes determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for award. Then, price will be evaluated and the quotes will be listed from lowest to highest price based on the total evaluated price and technical acceptability.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL EVALUATION STANDARD:</p>
<p>The contractor shall address the following two factors:</p>
<p>1. Factor 1 - Technical Capability - Offeror shall clearly demonstrate its approach to technical ability to meet the requirements of CLIN/Line Items based on meeting the requirements of the RFQ, quantity, quality and timeliness of delivery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Factor 2 - Price - The offeror shall complete CLIN pricing on page one (1) of this solicitation. In addition to the completed CLIN pricing on page one (1), the offeror shall provide sufficient price information to allow the contracting officer to determine the completeness and reasonableness of the offerors prices.</p>
<p>DISCUSSIONS: If during the evaluation period it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government to hold discussions, Offeror responses to clarifications/discussion notices will be considered in making the source selection decision.</p>
<p>AWARD DECISION: The award decisions will be made as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Step One - Determine Technical Acceptability. The technical evaluation, Factor 1, stated above, will assess the offerors capability to satisfy the Government's requirement. The Government will evaluate all technical capability quotes received by the required date/time. The Technical Capability factor will receive a rating of acceptable and unacceptable. If any factor is rated unacceptable, the entire quote is rendered technically unacceptable, and the quote will be removed from the competitive range. Only quotes deemed technically acceptable (either initially or as the result of discussions) will be considered for award. The ratings are defined in the following table.</p>
<p>Rating Description<br />Acceptable Quote clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation. Only those quotes determined acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussion will be considered for award. Once deemed acceptable, all technical quotes are considered to be equal.<br />Unacceptable Quote does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation. Quotes with an unacceptable rating will not be considered for award.</p>
<p>Table A-1</p>
<p>(2) Step Two - Evaluate Price. The offeror's Price quote will be evaluated, for award purposes, based upon the total price proposed as annotated under Factor 2 - Price.</p>
<p>(3) Step Three - Award Decision. Award will be made the lowest priced, technically acceptable offeror, subject to a positive responsibility determination in accordance with FAR Part 9 and conformance of the offeror's quote to the terms and conditions of the solicitation.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER:</p>
<p>This is a request for the submission of a quote and does not constitute a contract or authorization to begin work. Nor does an offeror's submission of a quote constitute a contract or authorize the individual or company to being work. The Contracting Officer is the only person who can legally modify a resulting contract or obligate the Government for expenditure of funds. Costs shall be incurred by recipients of the solicitation in anticipation of receiving direct reimbursement from the Government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only the Contracting Officer has the authority to authorize deviations from the terms and conditions of any resulting contract, including deviations from specifications and requirements. In the event the Contractor does deviate, without written approval of the Contracting Officer, such deviations shall be at the risk of, and any cost related thereto shall be borne by the Contractor. Any matter concerning a change to the scope, prices, costs, terms or conditions of this contract shall be referred to the Contracting Officer.</p>

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 13 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The USAID Mission in South Sudan (USAID/South Sudan) and USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) are seeking a highly motivated, highly qualified individual who would like the opportunity to help support a rapid international transition program in South Sudan. The Deputy Country Representative's principal responsibility will be the development, oversight and management of political transition programming that is jointly managed by OTI, the USAID Africa Bureau, and USAID/South Sudan.<br /> <br />USAID supports U.S. Government objectives to reduce conflict in South Sudan. All efforts are coordinated with, and complementary to, the full range of USAID and Department of State assistance efforts. The Viable Support to Transition and Stability (VISTAS) program is USAID's primary vehicle for delivering a fast and flexible response to emerging priorities in South Sudan. Primarily through in-kind small grants and technical assistance, VISTAS activities are designed to create or preserve political space and help set the stage for more profound longer-term change.<br /> <br />The OTI Deputy Country Representative is a member of the Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Africa Regional Team, and reports to the Washington-based OTI Regional Team Leader or his/her designee. As a member of the USAID/South Sudan country team and, specifically, the USAID/South Sudan Office of Transition and Conflict Mitigation (OTCM), the Deputy Country Representative will be required to work closely and coordinate with the USAID/South Sudan Mission Director and other technical teams such as the Program Office and USAID/South Sudan Office of Democracy and Governance.

Familiarity with a wide range of issues is necessary, including community development, mediation/arbitration, conflict resolution, democracy/governance and human rights. Excellent interpersonal, presentation and negotiation skills are necessary. Experience in contract and grant management is required.</p>
<p>In addition, the Deputy Country Representative may be required to manage the USAID/South Sudan Mission's engagement in the Abyei Area, a disputed and politically sensitive area between Sudan and South Sudan, requiring political acumen and coordination with USAID/OFDA, USAID/Sudan, Embassy Khartoum, Embassy Juba, and other USG and non-USG stakeholders.

It is also essential that the incumbent demonstrate the ability to maintain staff morale in a difficult work environment. Strong team-building skills are essential.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Deputy Country Representative requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The incumbent has a high level of integrity and attention to detail to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation. The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. She or he places a premium on the building of positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The incumbent is able to prioritize and complete tasks without follow-up by the supervisor, while also filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The Deputy Country Representative is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the DCHA/OTI Country Representative or his/her designee, the Deputy Country Representative will perform the following duties:</p>
<p>&bull;	Represent OTI interests during meetings with USAID Mission personnel, U.S. Embassy staff, host-country government officials, international organizations, indigenous and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international donors, and others interested in DCHA/OTI activities;<br /> <br />&bull;	Provide continued guidance on the identification and development of projects that meet OTI funding criteria, further OTI programmatic objectives, and complement other projects and programs implemented by other OTI offices, U.S. Government agencies and donor organizations;</p>

Support to embassies and USAID Missions may include attendance and/or facilitation of program management processes for follow-on programming including rolling assessments, strategy review sessions, program performance reviews, and management reviews;</p>
<p>&bull;	Evaluate proposals and grant concepts and work with diverse groups, many of which have not previously had international funding;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist the Country Representative in monitoring the performance of OTI implementing partners in the implementation of OTI-financed activities designed to achieve OTI strategic objectives;</p>
<p>&bull;	Travel to monitor and assess political conditions, implementing partner operational platforms, meet with potential grantees, host government and other program counterparts, and develop activity ideas;</p>
<p>&bull;	Mentor and train OTI and implementing partner field staff as required;</p>
<p>&bull;	Take the lead on collecting information and drafting/editing regular reporting products;</p>
<p>&bull;	When required, assume higher representational responsibilities, potentially serving as Acting OTI Country Representative in his/her absence;</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform a wide range of administrative functions including budget preparation, financial management, records management, and travel assistance, to help ensure programmatic success;</p>
<p>&bull;	Coordinate with the OTI Country Representative to develop an exit strategy that ensures reasonable time to transition from OTI programs to follow-on USAID or other donor programs;</p>
<p>&bull;	Communicate regularly and share program information with other USAID project managers, the U.S. Embassy, bilateral donors, United Nations organizations, international organizations, and indigenous and international NGOs to ensure visibility and synergy of USAID/OTI activities;</p>
<p>&bull;	Support the Country Representative to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation;</p>
<p>&bull;	When required, report to the OTI Country Representative and OTI/Washington on the status of: 1) grant development and implementation, 2) OTI contractor performance, 3) Foreign Service National (FSN) staff support needs and morale, 4) communication and coordination issues among OTI offices with other U.S. Government entities, 5) security concerns, 6) relations with local partners including local, state and national government representatives, and 7) other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist the Country Representative in managing and/or supervising the FSN staff, including program officers, administrative assistants and drivers;</p>
<p>&bull;	Supervise staff as delegated by the Country Representative (e.g. Program Managers, Program Assistants, Administrative Program Assistants, etc.). Provide orientation, training, and mentoring for staff supervised; assign work, explain how duties are to be performed to meet expectations, and communicate how the successful performance of those duties will be measured; evaluate staff performance; recognize good performance; communicate where performance needs to be improved; resolve complaints; and approve leave requests and timesheets as well as training, travel, program and operations requests;</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform other duties as determined by the supervisor or OTI Regional Team Leader to ensure successful OTI program implementation.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Deputy Country Representative will be supervised by the OTI Country Representative or his/her designee in the country of assignment. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision. Though this is a senior field-based position, the incumbent is expected to actively and proactively collaborate with OTI/Washington leadership, and to fully utilize, embrace, and become an expert on OTI systems and processes. Failure to adequately perform the scope of work above and/or failure to take direction from the supervisor may result in corrective actions, including denial of step or grade increases, extension of contract probationary periods, performance improvement plans, and/or termination for the convenience of USAID/OTI.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The supervisor will set overall objectives and resources available, and work with the employee to develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished. The employee will be responsible for planning and carrying out assignments, resolving most conflicts, coordinating with others, and interpreting policy in terms of established objectives.

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>1. Based off of the documentation, this request is for the renewal of 1 existing WebInspect CC User and one LIM Server. It also appears that 1 additional new license is also being requested for this quote.<br />Can you confirm that this is the case? I only ask because once we get to the option years of this request, it looks like all of the products are consolidated into one line item even though the quote would contain multiple products.</p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>1. The request is for maintenance renewal of one (1) existing WebInspect CC User license and LIM Server, and one (1) new WebInspect CC User license and LIM server. Option year pricing should include the maintenance for both licenses.</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>The solicitation number is FDA-SOL-1145520. This solicitation is issued as a, Total Small Business Set Aside in accordance with the SBA Non-Manufacture Rule waiver dated January 1, 2015, Request for Quote (RFQ), using the Simplified Acquisitions Procedures of FAR 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items. <br />The solicitation documented and incorporated provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) FAC 2005-80, Effective 02 Mar 2015.<br />The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is - 334516 - Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing; Small Business Size Standard is 500 in number of employees.<br />The US Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) intends to issue a Commercial Item Firm Fixed-Price purchase order that meets the following specifications below. Please submit all quotes to be valid until September 30, 2015.<br />SUPPLIES OR SERVICES AND PRICES/COSTS<br />The contractor shall fill out the following pricing sheet:<br />CLIN Description Qty Unit<br />of Issue Price<br />0001 Agilent 1290 Infinity UHPLC System 3 EA $<br /><br />Total Amount <br />$</p>
<p>I. Background/Intro<br />The Mycotoxin Group in the Southeast Regional Laboratory (SRL) analyzes various grains, nuts and milk commodities for toxic metabolites produced by certain fungi that can infect and proliferate on various agricultural commodities in the field and/or during storage. SRL serves as the national servicing lab for all districts for domestic aflatoxin testing. The increase in sample load for FY15 is justification for the need a Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC) system to analyze large volume of samples in less time would greatly increase sample throughput and decrease sample turn-around times. The demand for multi-residue analyses would require the use of this UHPLC system since it employs a dual detection system for both fluorescence and diode array detection. <br />II.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

This is a commercial item acquisition. The evaluation and award procedures in FAR 13.106 apply.<br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.

Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(End of Provision)<br />EVALUATION</p>

<p>Past performance will be evaluated for relevance based on the past performance narrative included in the Offeror's quotation.

<p>Factor III - PRICE: The Government will evaluate price for completeness, price reasonableness, and unbalanced pricing. Price quotations will not be scored, ranked, nor rated.</p>
<p>Price evaluation shall be conducted as follows:</p>
<p>1. The unit price of each CLIN: shall be multiplied by the actual or estimated quantity to arrive at an estimated total cost. The total of all CLIN's, including all option year CLIN's, shall be added together to arrive at an aggregate total. <br />2. Evaluation of Options: The Government will evaluate offers, for award purposes only, by adding the total price for all options to the total price for go the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options.<br />3. Realism: The Government will evaluate the realism of the price by assessing the compatibility of the quotation with the scope and effort. For the price to be realistic, it must reflect what it would cost the offeror to perform the required effort, when performed with reasonable economy and efficiency. Price realism evaluation includes a review of the overall costs in the offeror's quotation to determine:<br />&bull; If prices are realistic for the work proposed<br />&bull; If prices reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and<br />&bull; If prices are consistent with the various elements of the offeror's quotation</p>
<p>4. Reasonableness: In accordance with FAR 15.101, Best Value Continuum and FAR Part 15.101-1, Tradeoff process, permits the tradeoffs among cost or price and non-cost factors and allows the Government to accept other than the lowest priced quotation. <br />X.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT (NOI)  <br>  FEDERAL AGENCY NAME: The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Manufacturing and Industrial Base Policy (MIBP) via its Defense Manufacturing Science and Technology Program   <br>  AWARDING AGENCY NAME: U.S. Army Contracting Command-New Jersey, Emerging Technologies Contracting Center (ACC-NJ, ET) on behalf of the U.S. Armaments Research, Development & Engineering Center (ARDEC)   <br>  ANNOUNCEMENT TITLE: Revolutionary Fibers and Textiles-Institute for Manufacturing Innovation (RFT-IMI)   <br>  ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: This is a Notice of Intent   <br>  ANNOUNCEMENT NUMBER: W15QKN-15-R-0074  <br>    <br>  1. GENERAL INTENT: The purpose of this Notice is to announce the U.S. Government's intent to seek competition for the ninth Institute for Manufacturing Innovation (IMI) as part of the Administration's National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI) initiative. It is the sixth IMI to be led by the Department of Defense (DOD).  Of the eight Institutes previously announced by the President of the United States, five are led by DOD and three are led by the Department of Energy (DOE). The DOD is leading IMIs focused on the following technology areas: (1) additive manufacturing (America Makes); (2) lightweight and modern metals (Lightweight Innovations for Tomorrow (LIFT)); (3) digital manufacturing and design; (4) integrated photonics; and (5) flexible hybrid electronics. The DOE is similarly leading IMIs focused on the following technology areas: (6) power electronics (Power America); (7) advanced composites; and (8) smart manufacturing for energy efficiency. These Institutes are bringing together industry, universities and community colleges, federal agencies, and state organizations to accelerate innovation by investing in industrially-relevant manufacturing technologies with broad applications. They are intended to bridge the gap between basic research and product development, provide shared assets allowing access to cutting-edge capabilities and equipment, and create an unparalleled environment to educate and train students and workers in advanced manufacturing skills. Each Institute will serve as a regional hub of manufacturing excellence, providing the innovation infrastructure to support regional manufacturing hubs, thus ensuring that the U.S. manufacturing sector is a key pillar in an economy that is built to last.  <br>    <br>  2. THIS INSTITUTE: The technical focus area for this Institute will be revolutionary fibers and textiles.  The Institute will be referred to in the solicitation phase as the Revolutionary Fibers and Textiles Institute for Manufacturing Innovation (RFT-IMI).   <br>  Advances in fiber science have created fibers with extraordinary properties. Exceptional strength, flame resistance, electrical and other novel properties have revolutionized the fibers and textiles application space - hence the use of the term 'revolutionary.'  Revolutionary fibers and textiles are a fast growing segment in the overall fiber and textile marketplace with a wide range of commercial and defense applications.  They cover a range of fiber systems that are often known as technical textiles, composed of specialty fabrics, industrial fabrics, e-textiles, and advanced textiles. The core characteristic of technical textiles is that they are built upon a foundation of predominantly synthetic fibers and/or multi-material fibers.  <br>    <br>  These revolutionary textiles keep the warfighter protected, unburdened and empowered across the spectrum of operations through the development of, but not limited to, the following: (1) uniforms and load-bearing equipment with protective ballistic/stab puncture capabilities and environmental/physical trauma mitigation; (2) air, land and sea transportation for personnel and cargo; (3) air, land and sea precision delivery systems; (4) novel structures for turbine and rotor hubs; (5) protective shelters; (6) energy harvesting equipment; and (7) a variety of other smart textile (integrated electronics) products. Additionally commercial applications include, but may not be limited to: (1) protections against biological, environmental and chemical agents (e.g. Ebola barrier suits); (2) sensor-enabled textiles that can monitor health of athletes and fitness enthusiasts by monitoring heart  rate, oxygen content, etc.; (3) construction, geosynthetic applications and durable textiles that can reinforce roads, bridges, dams and prevent soil erosion; (4) glass and carbon fiber applications in wind power, aviation and space travel;  (5) enabling wearable technology and (6) sports equipment including flying, sailing, climbing, angling, cycling, winter and summer sports.  Advances in processes like weaving, knitting, and braiding for novel synthetic fibers can enable numerous applications in the composites, wearable electronics and Internet of things (IOT) markets. Innovations in modelling, simulation, verification and validation through the RFT-IMI can create additional synergies in multiple markets.  <br>    <br>  The RFT-IMI will serve as a public-private partnership between government, academia and industry to address the spectrum of manufacturing challenges associated with this technology, from design to end products. It is envisioned to support an end-to-end innovation 'ecosystem' in the U.S. for revolutionary fibers and textiles manufacturing and leverage domestic manufacturing facilities to develop and scale-up manufacturing processes. The RFT-IMI will provide innovative system demonstrations based on robust design and simulation tools, pilot production facilities, a roster of subject matter experts, suppliers, and workforce development opportunities through targeted training and curriculum programs. The RFT-IMI will be structured to allow government, industry and academia to collaborate together on pre-competitive research, development, and demonstration with the goal of enhancing the currently fragmented U.S. textile manufacturing capabilities and better position the U.S. relative to global competition. The RFT-IMI will also enable universities, industry and government to participate in and benefit from the resulting manufacturing advances. The RFT-IMI will be structured to address both commercial and DOD applications with a focus on maturing technology from Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) 4 to 7. The RFT-IMI will be expected to become self-sustaining after completion of the five year cooperative agreement.  <br>    <br>  3.  AWARD INFORMATION:  The U.S. Government intends to enter into a five year cooperative agreement and provide federal funding of $75 million that is to be matched or exceeded by funding from private industry and other non-federal sources (minimum 1:1 cost share).  A solicitation is expected to be released in mid-April 2015 with a Proposer's Day to follow shortly thereafter (exact date and location will be announced later).  The Proposer's Day will be for informational purposes only, and attendance is not a prerequisite for submitting a proposal.  <br>    <br>  4.  INQUIRIES:  All questions may be directed via email using the title  quote mark NOI RFT-IMI Questions quote mark  in the subject line to:  <br>    <br>  Lauren McDermott  <br>  Contract Specialist  <br>  ACC-NJ, ET  <br>  Email: lauren.a.mcdermott.civ@mail.mil  <br>    <br>  All questions received and answers will be posted on manufacturing.gov  <br>    <br>  5. DISCLAMER: This NOI does not constitute a solicitation. A future announcement will be posted that will provide solicitation requirements for an assistance award.  <br>    <br>  THIS IS NOT A CALL FOR PROPOSALS. DO NOT SUBMIT PROPOSALS AT THIS TIME. ANY PROPOSALS RECEIVED WILL BE DISCARDED   <br>    <br>

In addition, the previous posting of Amendment 000001 provided an Attachment J.4 that was incorrectly named Section J Att J.4 Amendment 00001.  The correct abbreviated name for this document is Section J Att J.4 Amendment 000001.  Because this correction only adds a fifth zero in the amendment number in the name for Attachment J.4 but does not change the document itself, a revised Attachment J.4 is not being provided at this time.**

**Amendment 000001 removes the previously posted Section J Attachment J.4 ARTCC CRITICAL AND ESSENTIAL POWER SYSTEM SITE LIST MicroSoft (MS) Word document and replaces it with Section J Attachment J.4 Amendment 000001 in as an MS Excel document.  The amended J.4 attachment provides mailing addresses for all twenty-five (25) of the ACEPS facilities that were previously listed on the original Attachment J.4.  NOTE:  Offerors are NOT to contact these facilities in any manner  the addresses are being provided for proposal preparation only**  

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for the replacement of battery systems at 25 Air Route Traffic Control Center Critical/Essential Power System (ACEPS) facilities (21 Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCCs), 3 large Terminal Radar Approach Control Facilities (TRACONs) and 1 ACEPS training facility).

<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 3, Bloomington, MN intends to award a sole source firm fixed price purchase order under authority of FAR 6.302-1, Other than Full and Open Competition procedures and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition procedures to Amirix Systems Inc., Bedford, NS.  This requirement is for the use of ultrasonic telemetry used to track movement of Asian Carp and priority species throughout the water of the Midwest.  This project is a collaboration effort among U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and several state agencies. Acoustic coded tags will be implanted into Asian Carp and priority species in the Midwestern waterways. Fish will be tracked using fixed receivers and mobile tracking devices. The 69 kHz acoustic coded tags and acoustic monitoring receivers are already in place in both systems.  To maintain capability among the collaborating agencies, the continuous use of both 69 kHz acoustic tags and monitoring receivers are imperative.  Amirix Systems Inc., doing business as VEMCO is the only manufacturer that produces both 69 kHz acoustic coded tags and acoustic monitoring receivers that would allow for full compatibility of all acoustic coded tags and acoustic monitoring receivers in the system.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 334511. The size standard is 750. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals; however firms with expressed interest and capability are encouraged to respond.  This notice is for informational purposes only.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>Contracting Office Address: <br />Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Institute on Drug Abuse, Station Support Simplified Acquisitions, 31 Center Drive, Room 1B59, Bethesda, MD 20892.
<p>Introduction:<br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.</p>
<p>The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes. No award will be made as a result of this notice. The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice. This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p><br />North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) CODE:<br />The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is 541990 - All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services - and the associated small business size standard of $15.0 million dollars.</p>
<p>Background Information:  <br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), Section on Development and Affective Neuroscience (SDAN) is a laboratory designed to conduct research on therapeutics of anxiety, with a particular focus on extending research in neuroscience to the realm of therapeutics. Such research requires diverse expertise in therapeutics and in cognitive neuroscience techniques.  SDAN is currently using computer-based gaming technology to train attention for therapeutic purposes.  This research provides preliminary evidence on the efficacy of computer-based technologies for the treatment of anxiety.  However, the current versions of these computer-based treatments rely on relatively simple graphical display and research within SDAN suggests that greater efficacy may emerge from more complex displays.  SDAN needs to develop treatments that are more engaging in the hopes of enhancing efficacy.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives for the Acquisition: <br />The overall goal of this potential purchase order is to evaluate a variety of options for producing a game-based attentional bias modification (ABM) program that supports and extends on-going ABM research, develop an optimal candidate design, and articulate the design through several means (functional wireframes, game narrative, and project roadmap) to facilitate NIMH review of the potential of game-based approaches to improve current promising ABM research at the NIMH and elsewhere.</p>
<p>SDAN potentially requires the expertise from a group with more experience developing such games and possesses the skills and equipment to produce a more engaging software tool.</p>
<p>Contractor Requirements (Scope of Work): <br />The contractor shall develop prototype games for the purposes of attention bias modification.  These games will incorporate key aspects of games used previously in research at NIMH.  Thus, the games will include various pictures, some that will have emotional content and others that will have neutral content.  These pictures will be presented in the format of a game, on a graphical display, presented on a portable computer.  Subjects playing the game will be required to perform rapid responses when they detect these pictures that appear within the video game, using a game controller that will interface with the graphical display.  This graphical display will used high-quality graphics, similar to those used previously in other health-related games.  The high quality of the graphical display will be designed explicitly to engage the subject in the game.  The game also will generate performance data, based on the subjects responses performed on the game controller, which can be down-loaded directly into a data base</p>
<p>Anticipated period of performance:<br />It is anticipated that the period of performance for this requirement will be one (1) twelve-month base period.<br /> <br />Capability Statement:<br />Contractors that believe they possess the ability to provide the required services should submit documentation of their ability to meet the project requirements to the Contract Specialist.  Contractors should also provide their Company Name, DUNS number, Physical Address, and Point of Contact Information.</p>
<p>Interested organizations are required to identify their type of business, applicable North American Industry Classification System Code, and size standards in accordance with the Small Business Administration. The government requests that no proprietary or confidential business data be submitted in a response to this notice. However, responses that indicate the information therein is proprietary will be properly safeguarded for Government use only. Capability statements must include the name and telephone number of a point of contact having authority and knowledge to discuss responses with Government representatives. Capability statements in response to this market survey that do not provide sufficient information for evaluation will be considered non-responsive. When submitting this information, please reference the solicitation notice number.</p>

All responses must be received by the specified due date and time in order to be considered.</p>

Offerors shall follow the instructions for completing the SF330.  Any attachments should be single sided, double spaced, with 1" margins on paper not to exceed  8" x 11"   and a minimum of 10 point font. 2.   Criteria #3.  Taking into consideration current and projected workload commitments, the firm's capacity to staff the contract with experienced, trained personnel at the appropriate levels and disciplines.(as presented in Section H and Part II of firms' SF 330's; (Requirement for Additional Attachments 1 and 2 are hereby deleted) 3.  Frequently Asked Questions and Answers and additional information will be posted to http://www.epa.gov/oamsrpod/pmrcsc/rac2/R3.htm 	The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires professional architect and engineering services to support remedial planning and oversight activities in Region III which includes Pennsylvania, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia.  	These services include site management; remedial investigation feasibility studies; engineering services to design remedial actions; engineering evaluation and cost analysis for non-time critical removal actions; construction management for implementing remedial actions and non-time critical removal actions, including issuing and managing subcontracts for construction of the selected remedy and engineering services in overseeing construction; enforcement support, including oversight of remedial investigations/feasibility studies, remedial design and remedial action, and negotiation support; and other technical assistance, including community relations, sampling and analysis support, and pre-design investigations.  	Services may include technical and management services supporting EPA's coordination and oversight of remedial actions where they are performed by a state, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, or responsible parties identified in enforcement actions. 	The requirement's North American Industry Classification System Code is 562910 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  At least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended  for employees of the prime contractor. 	This procurement envisions the award of two Response Action Contracts (RAC).  These contracts will be cost-plus-fixed-fee.  The base period of performance will be five years, with one five-year option period for a potential total period of ten years.  Work will be issued by level-of-effort work assignments.  Each contract will have a minimum guarantee of 10,000 hours and a base period maximum of 130,000 hours and a maximum of $17,000,000 in the subcontracting pool.  Upon exercise of the five-year option period, the contract option period will be modified to include a minimum guarantee of 10,000 hours and a option period maximum of 130,000 hours and a maximum of $17,000,000 in the subcontracting pool.  The total estimated cost-plus-fixed-fee of the contract (including options) is $60,000,000. 	These RACs shall be awarded as a Brooks Act Procurement.  Offerors shall submit Standard Form 330.  For this procurement, EPA requires that the offerors organize the information so as to highlight responses to the technical Evaluation Criteria.  This will facilitate review of the information submitted. 	Selection will be based on the following evaluation criteria which are listed in descending order of importance: 	1.  Professional qualifications of staff expected to perform the services listed in the synopsis.(as presented in sections E, G, H, and Part II of firms' SF 330's) 	2.  Specialized experience and technical competence of staff expected to perform the services listed in the synopsis.   (as presented in sections E, F, G, H and Part II of firms' SF 330S) 	3.  Taking into consideration current and projected workload commitments, the firm's capacity to staff the contract with experienced, trained personnel at the appropriate levels and disciplines.  (as presented in Section H and Part II of firms' SF 330's; Additional Attachments 1 and 2) 	4.  Past performance of the prime contractor on contracts for similar services, with respect to cost control, quality of work, and schedule adherence.   	5.  Firm's geographic location and familiarity with the localities within EPA Region III; provided, that application of this criteria leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms.  	Selected firms shall be asked to submit a cost proposal, and the Government will proceed with negotiations.

<DESC>A construction contract will be issued for repair and painting of seven (7) Tainter Gates, one (1) bulkhead lifting beam, and other miscellaneous appurtenant metal components&nbsp;at Cheatham Dam located on the Cumberland River near Ashland City, TN. <br /><br />The Tainter Gates are 27'x60' gates with skin plate on the Upstream and Downstream face. All seven gates have similar deterioration and will require replacement of a substantial number of bolts and rivets, replacement of all side seals (rubber), member replacement in the lower section of the gate, installation of an access hatch on the top of the gate, straightening or build-up of the lower seal and other miscellaneous metal repairs. Currently the interior of the gates are coated with coal tar epoxy and the exterior with a vinyl paint system. All structural components have been tested for lead based paint and positive results were attained on numerous components. Hence the contractor shall plan for hazardous waste removal and disposal. The gates will be repainted with similar paint systems. <br /><br />The spillway bulkhead lifting beam will require member straightening, minor welding, and bolt replacement. The spillway bulkhead lifting beam shall be blasted and repainted with a vinyl paint system similar to the exterior of the Tainter Gates. <br /><br />All work will be performed on-site. Government furnished spillway bulkheads shall be placed upstream and downstream of the Tainter Gates for the duration of the repair and painting operations. Placement of the spillway bulkheads will require marine plant and will be the responsibility of the contractor. The contractor may be required to install downstream bulkhead seal angles via the use of divers. The existing spillway bulkheads allow for unwatering of one gate bay only. A second set of spillway bulkheads will be procured by the Government outside of this contract and will be available to the construction contractor in 2016. <br /><br />River conditions fluctuate substantially at Cheatham Dam and the contractor may encounter periods of shutdown and / or demobilization. The construction season for this contract is from June 1 to November 30 (6 months). It is expected that all work can be performed in 3.5 construction seasons. The estimated length of the contract is&nbsp;42 months. <br /><br />A low price technically acceptable (LPTA) type acquisition is planned with four (4) evaluation factors. This contract will be organized as a base plus options contract. The estimated value of this contract is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000. <br /><br />The intent is to post the solicitation the week of 20 April 2015.&nbsp; Participation in a site visit is mandatory to be eligible for award.&nbsp; The site visit is scheduled for 30 April 2015 at 10:00 AM EDT.&nbsp; Register via email for the site visit within 24 hours of the start time to <a href="mailto:James.W.Purcell@usace.army.mil">James.W.Purcell@usace.army.mil</a> <br /><br />Site visit location is Cheatham Powerplant conference room at 2250 Cheatham Dam Road, Charlotte, TN 37036-5058.&nbsp; Vehicular access is from the West Bank of the Cumberland River in Dickson County.&nbsp; There is no vehicular access across the&nbsp;lock and&nbsp;dam from the East.<br />

<CONTACT>Douglas R Raney, Phone 9783188671, Email douglas.r.raney.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District has issued a <br />solicitation set aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business <br />(SDVOSB) for Invitation for Bid (IFB) for Barnes Building Roof Repairs in <br />Boston, MA. This was previously pre-solicited against solicitation number W912Wj-14-B-0009 which has expired/is archived and unavailable. <br /><br />The NAICS code for this procurement is 238160. <br /><br />The estimated construction cost is between $100,000 and $500,000.00. The project is <br />planned to be issued on or about April 2014. <br /><br />The building is a 58,000 square foot, 10-story office building in a dense urban area exposed to coastal storms and high winds. The existing roofing system is <br />a fully adhered Ethylene-Propylene-Diene-Monomer (EPDM) system which has been damaged during recent storm events, including Hurricane Sandy. Damages include partial separation of the EPDM from insulation substrates, partial separation of the EPDM from the perimeter parapet wall, water penetration below the EPDM into insulation layers, and other damages and general age deterioration. High wind events have caused the EPDM to balloon over large areas of the roof, worsening existing deterioration, and threatening to completely separate the EPDM from substrate material,creating a potential hazard in adjacent areas. <br /><br />Specific work tasks are intended to reconstruct severely deteriorated areas of <br />the roof and to secure the remaining existing EPDM and substrate materials in <br />place. These tasks include: full depth roof repair (new insulation and EPDM) <br />in limited areas (approximately 1250 SF), reattachment of the EPDM to the <br />perimeter parapet wall, caulking, and installing a sandbag ballast and wrap <br />and tie system at selected locations on the roof. <br /><br />The logistics are a consideration for this project since it is located in the city of Boston. Traffic control and pedestrian traffic control will be necessary, with the possibility of shutdown of the street. The building has limited access for large <br />equipment on multiple sides of the building. The building is adjacent with another large high-rise building which is separated by a narrow alley. The building and adjacent parking lots will be occupied during the construction contract. A staging area adjacent to the building will be made available to the Contractor. <br /><br />. Neither telephonic,&nbsp; mailed nor faxed requests for hard copies of this solicitation will be accepted. <br />The solicitation will only be available online; in order to download the solicitation, offerors must access the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.fbo.gov).

<DESC>Amendment 0001  <br> Pre-Solicitation Notice <br> Building 4, Del Din, Vicenza, Italy <br>  <br> W912GB-15-R-0025 <br>  <br> Amendment 0001 to Pre-Solicitation:  The purpose of this amendment is to answer requests for information and update the pre-solicitation notice.   <br>  <br> 1.	Question:  I am contacting you to show some interest in the subject opportunity. We have been analyzing the Solicitation and we are kind of concern about the SOA requirement. As the host country (Italy) belongs to the European Union, you may know that all the Member States are in the Common European Market, so all the countries shall have the fair opportunity to compete for this effort. We would like to remark that Company X has a Branch Office in Italian soil from which it operates in the whole country. However, despite of having all the official documents needed: Documento Unico di Regolarit  Contributiva (DURC), Certificato Anti-mafia, Nulla Osta, Registro a la Camera di Commercio etc... we do not hold the Italian SOA because we can use the Spanish classifications, which are equivalent.  Being said that, instead of the SOA Certification, which is only for Italian companies, we would like to request the possibility of including in lieu of the SOA Certification, an equivalent document, issued by a competent authority of any member country of the European Union. A third competent party shall certify (in English) that the document is equivalent to the Italian SOA classifications required for this bid, just as we have been addressed to do in other projects within the US Department of Defense. Additionally, we can include the Italian classifications through a Letter of Commitment with a Designated Subcontractor. <br>  <br> Answer: The Italian pre-qualification requirements may not be satisfied with the submission of European Union certifications instead of Italian pre-qualification requirements. Therefore, the Offerors must provide copies of its Italian certifications.  The SOA registration is required by Italian Law. The SOA registration cannot be avoided and the Offerors must provide copies of its Italian certifications. <br>  <br> 2.	Question: We would be grateful if you could confirm that the documents requested to demonstrate compliance with the qualification requirements are to be provided at the next stage (prequalification stage) of this procedure. Otherwise, please inform us what documentation we need to submit at this stage.  <br>  <br> Answer:   As stated in the pre-solicitation notice:  quote mark Pre-Qualification: All interested firms are requested to demonstrate compliance with the qualification requirements as stated below in this document.

<DESC>Performance Work Statement
VA241-15-P-1047

1.0  INTRODUCTION - VA Providence Medical Center's Police Service requires the use of a (minimum) 75-feet firing range to provide firearms training and re-certifications to their police officers.  This service is required from 20 April 2015 to 19 April 2016.

 2.0  BACKGROUND - In accordance with VA Handbooks 0720 and 0730, all agency police officers must achieve and maintain qualifications in the use of agency-approved firearms at an armed facility as a condition of continued employment as a VA police officer. This includes meeting the provisions of the Gun Control Act of 1968, as amended by Public Law 104-208, and found at 18 USC 5-922.   Each otherwise qualified VA police officer at an armed facility will be provided appropriate training and a reasonable period of time to achieve weapons qualification.  All training will be conducted by certified agency firearms instructors.  Firearm range qualification and use of force training will be completed every 6 months using an approved course that has been sanctioned by the Office of Security and Law Enforcement (OS&LE).

3.0  SCOPE - The firearms range must be at least 75-feet in length and allow the use of 124gr. 9mm Jacketed hallow Point (JHP) Ammunition.  The facility should be indoors whereas weather is not a factor thus providing the ability to utilize the facility year round and shall have an air exchange quality system.

4.0  APPLICABLE DIRECTIVES - The firing range must meet all requirements as set by VA policy and the VA Police Law Enforcement Training Center. 

5.0  PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS - In addition to requirements listed in section 3.0, the range will supply the following:

The range will supply one annual membership per firearm instructor.  Memberships will include: Unlimited range time, 10% discount on all firearms courses and four guest passes.  All ammunition, targets, and firearms will be supplied by the government.  The Cleaning supplies to be provided by the agency and all maintenance of agency firearms to be conducted at the assigned duty station.


6.0  DELIVERY SCHEDULE - Mandatory firearms practice will be held on a quarterly basis with additional voluntary practice time offered upon request of an officer of when deemed necessary by the agency.  The range will be available once a quarter and at least twice a month for practice and training and for one week twice a year for semi-annual firearms re-qualifications.  Half the range will be available during scheduled firearms practice and the full range will be reserved twice a year in order to conduct semi-annual re-qualifications.

6.1  PROGRESS & COMPLIANCE - All Providence VA Police personnel will be required to successfully complete a semi-annual firearms re-qualification course.  This would require that each officer spend a minimum of one hour at the range every six months.  In addition, all armed Providence VA police personnel will be required to attend firearms practice on a quarterly basis.  Therefore half the range will be available at least twice a month for practice and training and the full range twice a year for semi-annual firearms re-qualifications.  All dates for firearms training and re-qualifications will be scheduled and pre-approved.  The government must provide 72-hour cancellation notice to the firearms range or the government will be billed $350 for the time scheduled.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION: This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice for the following services under project number 660-14-101-Secondary Electrical Panel Correction, projected at the George E. Wahlen Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) 500 Foothill Blvd., Salt Lake City, Utah 84148. This will be a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Business (SDVOSB) Set-aside. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL; NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE WILL BE ISSUED UNTIL AFTER AN EVALUATION HAS BEEN MADE ON THE PROVIDED SF-330. 

The George E. Wahlen Veterans Affair Medical Center (VAMC) is seeking an Architect/Engineering (A/E) firm to provide all A/E services for the investigation, preparation of working drawings, construction documents and cost estimates for the "Secondary Electrical Panel Correction" project at the George E. Wahlen VAMC 500 Foothill Blvd., Salt Lake City, Utah 84148. This project will design electrical systems in order to separate the existing electrical system of the main patient care building, building 14, into three zones so that each zone can be isolated electrically from each other. The building is currently separated into zones A, B, and C and the electrical towers that will house each zoned electrical system will be built as the third phase of this project (not part of this design) will match this zoning for the electrical system.  There are multiple runs of electrical feeds for the various panels that must route through each floor of the towers and the towers (towers designed in a subsequent project) must be sized to accommodate these feeds and still leave appropriate clearance per National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 70 for panel placement.  The A/E vendor is to consider future construction that will be in the vicinity of the towers in their design.  The designs must coordinate appropriately; as such the selected A/E will need to interface with the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) on all aspects of the project to ensure compliance with the other projects.
A/E is to provide all labor, equipment and materials required for the investigation of the existing site and preparation of design documents; progressive design documents required are as follows:  Schematic Design Documents, Design Development Documents, and Biddable Construction Documents.  It is required that the A/E hold progress "Over the Shoulder" review meeting with the VA at each of the three stages of document submission.   Three copies of plans and specifications are required to be delivered to the VA at each of the three stages of design and a construction estimate is required to be submitted at each stage of design.  A construction schedule is required to be submitted with the 100% Construction Documents as a comparative tool for the VA to use against the schedule the construction contractor submits.  Basic Construction Period Services are to be provided by the A/E firm for the duration of the construction period.
The design must, as a minimum, be in accordance with all applicable codes indicated in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Space Criteria, Space Equipment Planning System (SEPS), Design Manuals and VA PUBLICATIONS (Master Construction Specifications, Construction Standards, etc.).  This project design is to adhere to all building codes and standards including Joint Commission Accreditation Standards, National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Codes, VA Specifications and Standards, and American Institute of Architects (AIA) Standards unless otherwise approved in writing by VA.  Design is to follow all information outlined in VA Technical Information Library located at http://www.cfm.va.gov/til/dGuide.asp  unless otherwise approved in writing by VA.  Please note: The VA is its own Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) and is, therefore, not necessarily required to comply with the requirements of other AHJs with which the A/E firm may have worked.   Work includes, but is not limited to, Architectural, Mechanical and Electrical design services for the Secondary Electrical Panel Correction including but not limited to: (1) field investigation of existing site and building conditions and utility (including capacities) needs of existing building systems; (2) field verification of available record information (as-built drawings, etc.) for accuracy and omissions; (3) interview and work with VAMC staff to determine the best arrangement of the Secondary Electrical Panel Correction and associated systems to improve functionality, accommodate modern equipment and improve overall workflow.  The A/E will upon discovery of inconsistencies in specifications contact the Contracting Officer or Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) for further evaluation.

This design (including major mechanical equipment) will require energy modeling (annual building or zone simulation based on local weather data), and analysis during planning and all phases of design to achieve the energy budgets required in the above laws.  The typical design analysis will include a Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) on three different alternatives.  

A/E firm is to produce documents including construction drawings and specifications, construction schedules, and cost estimates for construction.  All work must be designed within a construction cost range of $1,000,000.00 to $2,000,000.00.

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS
Justification and Approval
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition


1. Contracting Activity: Department of Veterans Affairs, Program Contracting Office 

2. Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed: The VISN 1 Education Department seeks to enter into an Agreement for Transformational Leadership Training on a sole source basis to the University of Washington, Foster Business School, Center for Leadership & Strategic Thinking, Box 353226, Seattle, WA 98195-3226. 

This acquisition will allow the VISN 1 Education Department  to establish an agreement to maintain an essential capability for complex application of specific evidenced-based leadership training methods and expertise that cannot be performed solely by VISN 1. The anticipated value of this requirement, to be developed via individual calls, is $257,996. 
This requirement will be awarded as a new agreement. This will be a one-year contract with fixed 
price calls. 

3. Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs: Per Title 10 United States Code 2304 (c) (3) as implemented by FAR 6.302-3(a)(2)(ii), the VISN 1 Education Department facilitates innovative solutions to health care delivery challenges identified by national, network, and facility leadership as well as to propose important opportunities for change and improvement. A key element of this partnership is the involvement of faculty and students from its academic partners who will bring expertise in leadership and supervisor development practices. This is one of 12 academic partnerships with various universities VERC (Veteran's Engineering Resource Center) supports. The universities are needed to engage in highly-specialized projects of benefit to VHA in their areas of expertise; they will work in conjunction with and oversight by VISN 1 Education staff. 

The Contracting Officer intends to award with a NTE of $257,996 with a period of performance 1 June, 2015 - 31 May 2016. There is one (1) call for FY15, however additional calls maybe placed in FY16 under this agreement. 

4. Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition: 

( ) (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1; 
( ) (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2; 
(XX ) (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability 
or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3; 
( ) (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4 
( ) (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5; 
( ) (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6; 
( ) (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7; 

5. Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority): Accordingly, The University of Washington is an academic partner that specifically has capability to provide evidenced based leadership development expertise. The Foster School of Business Center for Leadership and Strategic Thinking at the University of Washington studies complex systems in industry and manufacturing settings, healthcare environments and society in general.  The University has led a wide spectrum of projects with multiple U.S. hospital systems, at their site, that focus on applied Leadership research projects that can be broadly classified under (a) Transformational Leadership, (b) productivity assessment and capacity planning, (c) strategic planning and future-state analysis, and (d) building authentic leadership in complex and adaptive environments. Examples of their research include significant amount of work in improving large dynamic organizations using effective supervisor and leader development. These efforts have been supported through partnerships with multiple organizations.  The Foster School of Business must be used as the sole source for VISN 1 Leadership Education for the following important reasons:
	a. Standardized Approach and Recognized Instructor: VISN 1 has worked hard to establish training around a single leadership philosophy that utilizes an evidenced- based approach.  Only The Foster School of Business provides the recognized expert in Transformational Leadership education (Dr. Bruce Avolio). His specific instruction is evidenced-based and is a very specific approach to Leadership Instruction that is unattainable through any other vendors.
	b. Content Validity:  VISN 1 currently uses the Avolio approach in all other leadership instruction. To develop a Leadership Training System, it is absolutely critical that VISN 1 maintain overall content validity. There is no other way to maintain overall Content Validity without using Dr. Avolio from the Foster School of Business. 
While other vendors can offer generic leadership training and some even offer training on what they call "Transformational Leadership" only The Foster School of Business provides the subject matter expert and ability to provide VISN 1 a standardized approach, recognized instructor, while maintaining content validity throughout. The importance of utilizing The Foster School of Business cannot be overstated. Any other provider would be a waste of government funds for what VISN 1 is attempting to provide its employees in the way of Leadership Training

6. Description of Efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as 
deemed practicable: Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-5(a) (2) (i) Full and Open 
Competition need not be provided for when a statute expressly authorizes or requires that the 
acquisition be made to maintain an essential capability for complex application of specific 
methods and expertise. This is a sole source requirement. 

7. Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair 
and Reasonable: The award will have commercial rates for various labor categories. Each task will require the contractor to submit a cost proposal for the labor category proposed which will be evaluated and compared with previous contracts that are similar in scope, against information in the Department of Labor Statistics, www.salary.com, and any other available information that may be applicable for cost realism purposes. It is expected that the proposed labor rate will be rate inclusive of General and Administrative and indirect costs. The Government will evaluate the contractor's proposal and determine fair and reasonable pricing at the time of award. 

8. Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons 
Market Research Was Not Conducted: No market research was conducted for this acquisition. VISN 1 
has developed a unique and mutual relationship with the university in the leadership and supervisor development field. The VISN Education Department has a mission requirement through a Strategic Initiative to develop supervisor ability using the evidenced-based approach from the University of Washington, Foster School of Business.  

9. Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:. The work to be performed as part of this project is not suitable for full and open competition due to the unique capabilities that the university currently offers the VHA on other projects, and the need for future continuity of service. This arrangement is mutually beneficial and highly cost effective in regard to the use of facilities and resources. The University of Washington has developed subject matter experts in leadership development related to workflow and process re-design; productivity assessment and capacity planning; strategic planning; and future-state analysis that would provide invaluable unique expertise to projects we develop. 
The requirement cannot be modified to enhance competition, as it is determined as a result of an Institutional review board approved protocol and are in line with the project as approved by the VISN 1 Executive Leadership Board. 

10. Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition: There are no other 
sources but the proposed. 

11. A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required: Given the unique nature of this requirement and the collaborative nature of research work, services must continue to be met through sole source provisions of FAR Subpart 6.302-3 (a) (ii), 6.302-3 (V) (ii) (2) (ii), and 6.302-5. 

12. Requirements Certification: I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
