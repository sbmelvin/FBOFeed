<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is in the process of constructing the National Fire Research Laboratory (NFRL). The NFRL is an expansion of NIST's existing Large Fire Laboratory and, when operational, will provide the capability to test full-scale building structures two stories in height and two bays by three bays in plan, under simulated dead and live loads and realistic fire conditions.
<p>The facility will be a unique National resource for large-scale structural-fire tests to validate computational models used to predict building performance. The facility will allow researchers to study the response of the full structure to fire, rather than the response of individual building elements or subassemblies as is current practice. Research conducted in this facility will help to provide the technical basis for improvements to codes, standards, and practice governing design of building structures for fire.</p>
<p>The NFRL has been designed with an 18 m by 27 m strong floor (with a basement below) and 9 m high by 18 m wide strong wall. Test specimens (structural components, assemblies or complete systems) will be anchored to the strong floor and supported or loaded by reacting against the strong wall or reaction frames that are anchored to the strong floor or wall.</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to procure structural reaction frames that will be used in the NFRL. The reaction frames shall be composed of a variety of components that can be configured in multiple ways to provide the reactions specific to a particular test. These components consist of steel columns, girders and lateral bracing modules, and fixtures that allow the components to be arranged to suit the test purposes.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this requirement is 332313 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. The required components are non-commercial in nature and will be procured using Simplified Acquisition Procedures under the authority of FAR Part 13. This requirement is 100% set-aside for small business. A firm fixed price purchase order is anticipated.</p>
<p>The competitive Request for Quotation (RFQ), amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement shall be made available via the Internet at HTTP://WWW.FEDBIZOPPS.GOV under RFQ number SB1341-12-RQ-0614.</p>
<p>Potential offerors shall be responsible for obtaining this solicitation and related Amendments, if any, from www.fbo.gov after the solicitation has been posted. It is, and will continue to be, the responsibility of each potential Offeror to monitor www.fbo.gov for any amendments or other information related to the solicitation. The Government will not maintain a mailing list.</p>
<p>Any communications regarding this acquisition must be made in writing and forwarded via email to carol.wood@nist.gov, and shall identify the solicitation number, company name, company address, as well as point of contact email address and phone number.</p>
<p>Offerors shall be actively registered in the Central Contractor Registration website at www.ccr.gov, in order to be eligible to receive a contract under this acquisition.</p>
<p>NIST anticipates posting the solicitation approximately three days after the date of publication of this notice.</p>

Office of Health Information

TEST GUIDE


1.	INTRODUCTION -  
This Sources Sought notice is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541611.  The VA is currently conducting market research to locate qualified, experienced, and interested potential sources.  Responses will not be considered as proposals, nor will any award be incurred by interested parties in responding to this sources sought announcement.

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is seeking interested sources (contractors) for a near-future solicitation and procurement for the Office of Health Information (OHI).  At this time, no solicitation exists.  Therefore please do not request a copy of the solicitation. 

2.	BACKGROUND
Health Systems is part of the Veterans Health Administration, Office of Health Information (VHA OHI). Health Systems functions as a matrix organization that identifies and works through cross cutting issues, and works to maximize use of resources in support of the IT systems that impact VHA.  A key objective of Health Systems is to work collaboratively with other VHA Program Offices and OHI components to monitor comprehensive portfolios of Information Technology (IT) systems to ensure VHA Business Needs are addressed. This includes the oversight of the IT project lifecycle management for all VHA IT systems and portfolios. 
In order to provide high-quality, reliable, accessible, timely, and efficient health care that maximizes the health and functional status of enrolled Veterans. The Department of Veterans Affairs determined that a new appointment scheduling system was necessary to reduce patient wait-time and improve the timeliness and efficiency of health care for Veterans.  The HealtheVet (HeV) Scheduling Application was initiated to respond to this need.  The HeV Scheduling Application will address those requirements and changes necessary to transition from a provider-centric (i.e., centered on availability of physicians) scheduling system to a resource-centric (i.e., centered on relationships and availability of applicable resources: physicians, practitioners, staff, patients, equipment, rooms, etc.) scheduling system.   

3.	OBJECTIVES
The contractor shall provide and deliver a Test Guide for the Veterans Health Administration's National Medical Scheduling business needs and reports.  
Utilizing previously developed documents such as the Business Blue Print Document; End to End Model; and Activity Description Tables; the contractor shall facilitate stakeholder discussions to develop the test guide.


The Business Blueprint Design is a document (attached) that addresses how VHA intends to operate Information Technology (IT) scheduling capability in a To-be environment from an end-to-end process centric perspective.  The information is from the businesses' view point and includes the details of the business requirements ('what' and 'why'), organizational units and roles, workflow, processes, sub-processes and capabilities, with traceability back to stated strategic objectives and critical success factors.  
      The test guide will include the following:
1.	Test Scenarios and Cases
2.	Test Procedures/Steps
3.	Test Data Set Descriptions
Test Traceability to business needs

The contractor shall provide professional business support services in the following  
Information Management and Information Technology (IM/IT) service areas:

Implementation Models:  This service area encompasses the development of implementation models for VHA health care facilities to transition from a provider-centric scheduling system to a resource-centric scheduling system;
Solution Development and Testing Activities:  This service area encompasses managing approved requirements across the HeV Scheduling Application product life cycle in order to ensure that end users and test teams understand all approved requirements;
1.	Addressing requirements status and traceability during phase reviews to ensure requirements are properly sequenced and that the requested functionality is delivered. 
2.	Performing activities to ensure that end users and test teams understand all approved requirements.

<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has a requirement to clear fence corridor and install new fencing and related gate work in the Shipman Unit of the Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge, Hilo HI.   Estimated linear footage of fencing in Shipman unit A is approximately 7,215 and estimated linear footage of fencing for Shipman unit B is 11,747.  The method of measurement for determining fence length was with hand held GPS Tremble units.  The contractor is required to make any adjustments in lengths based upon experience in adjusting for existing conditions such as ground slope and terrain.  A brief synopsis of fence products include 1) Steel Posts (T-133 galvanized t-posts with anchor type); 2) Woven Wire (high tensile steel woven wire fabric); 3) Barbed Wire (high tensile barbed wire, 15  gauge); 4) Fasteners (Clips: Benzinal or galfan coating); 5) Anchors (T-133 galvanized post); 6) Brace Wire and Anchor Wire; 7) Corner Posts and Stretcher Posts; 8) Brace Assemble;  and 8) Gates.  Detailed product specifications will be available with posting of solicitation and can currently be accessed from the following share web site:
 http://www.fws.gov/filedownloads/ftp_r1cgs_solicitations/F12PS00801/   
Magnitude of project is between $250,000.00 and $500,000.00.  Proposals that do not include a twenty (20) percent bid bond of the total price quoted with their proposal submission will be considered nonresponsive.  The successful awardee will be asked to provide a 100 percent payment and performance bond within 15 days of award.  Project is a small business set-aside.  Applicable NAICS code is 238990.  Small business size is defined as $14 million or less annually when averaged over a three year period.  A site visit will be held on August 14, 2012 at 9AM local time.

Lowest priced proposal will be based upon the combined total cost for all bid items.  If available funding at time of receipt of proposals is not sufficient to award all line items in the bid schedule, the Service will make a determination on what line items are considered most desirable based upon available monies.  Lowest price for all proposals will then be evaluated based upon the total for those line items deemed most desirable to the Service.  If the lowest priced proposal is technically acceptable, award will be made and no other proposals evaluated.  If the lowest priced proposal is not technically acceptable, the Service will evaluate the next lowest priced proposal and so on until a proposal is identified to be technically acceptable.  In determining whether a proposal as technically acceptable, the Service will be asking for a technical proposal (not-to-exceed five pages) that specifies similar capability/experience in performing elements of work as described in the attached statement of work with details of work experience over the last 3 years that describe their experience with constructing similar fencing in similar terrain,  as well as submission of up to three references (number of pages will not count towards the 5 page limit for the technical proposal submission) for past projects over the last five years that are similar in nature.  Information available from the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) may also be used to supplement the evaluation of past performance. Responsibility for insuring points of contact and telephone numbers on references are current are solely the responsibility of the contractor.

No further notice will be posted on Fedbizopps.  In consideration that funds have not officially been received yet, this synopsis notice provides notice that the Government obligation under this contract is contingent upon availability of appropriated funds.  If funds are received by the posting of the solicitation, no availability of funds clause will be included in the actual solicitation.
