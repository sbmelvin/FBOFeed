<CONTACT>Jason Siewert, Contract Officer, Phone 2164332916, Email jason.r.siewert@nasa.gov
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION <br />Horizontal Planar Near-Field/Compact Antenna Range
<p>1.0 Description<br />1.1The Communications and Intelligent Systems Division of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Glenn Research Center (GRC) is seeking information on how an interested supplier would propose designing a horizontal planar near-field and compact antenna range. The nominal test frequency range is 1 GHz to 110 GHz and it is desired to accommodate parabolic reflectors approaching diameters of approximately 33 feet (i.e., 10 m) in the near-field facility - if possible. The six schematics included with this Request For Information provide the chamber dimensions.</p>
<p>1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, NASA is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responding organizations are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the respondents to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>2.0 Background</p>
<p>This project is part of a major recapitalization effort under the GRC Master Plan which will allow the consolidation of research spaces across the Center into a single, state-of-the-art (SOA) research facility. The Aerospace Communications Facility (ACF) will be comprised of multiple research and development (R&amp;D) laboratories in support of aerospace communications research activities throughout the NASA GRC. These laboratory spaces will be highly reconfigurable, providing the flexibility needed to adapt to pursuit of new technologies and capabilities over the span of several decades. The ACF is visualized as a SOA research facility, featuring Glenn's communications competencies and their partnerships with NASA missions, academia and industry. As such, a prime purpose of this RFI is to obtain key information that would help NASA design the core building spaces for the future integration and development of a Horizontal Planar Near-Field/Compact Antenna Range system. NASA would seek to accommodate as large an antenna as possible in the Near-Field horizontal scanner range, and to maximize the target (i.e. quiet) zone volume in the Compact Antenna Range. Also, with regards to the compact range, a dual-chamber design - incorporating the primary feed and a Gregorian sub-reflector "below grade" to minimize diffracted fields and spillover - is of interest.<br />The Near-Field Range is the larger volume illustrated in the Figures, measuring approximately 39'9"L X 41'6"W X 49'6"H (clear dimensions).  The Compact Range measures 16'9"L X 41'6"W X 12'0"H (clear dimensions), and is situated on the ground floor level.  A shared control room is located on the second level, immediately above the Compact Range and a mechanical/electrical room serving the space occupies the third level.  The Near-Field range will be equipped with an under-running bridge crane of 10-ton rated capacity.  The ranges will be constructed from a patented reinforced shielded concrete panel system with integrally welded steel ceilings.  The attenuation provided by this method of construction is approximately 120dB in the Ka frequency band.  The ranges will be constructed upon a 10-inch thick reinforced concrete slab, however it is expected that additional foundations may need to be installed to support and isolate a horizontal scanner system.  The primary building foundations and structure will be design to provide VC-A/B levels of vibration isolation.  Mechanical systems will be capable of conditioning the spaces to nominally 74&deg;F +/- 1.5&deg;F at less than 60% relative humidity.  Quiescent state can be maintained during testing periods.  The spaces will be outfitted with 120VAC &amp; 208VAC electrical power with a 50 Watt-per-square-foot density.  Lighting, fire protection and ancillary systems are designed in accordance with the purpose of the spaces.<br />3.0 Requested Information<br />&#61656;	NASA intends to seek a singular turn-key solution that encompasses the Horizontal Near-Field Scanner and Compact Antenna Range as well as all associated signal conditioning, data acquisition, data processing, cabling, and necessary ancillary equipment, manufacturing, installation, activation, and validation. Respondents are asked to provide a short narrative (one or two paragraphs) explaining a partnership approach that might bring the technical developers, manufactures, and installers together with an integrator that can provide this turn-key approach. <br />&#61656;	Those organizations responding to this solicitation should provide the following additional pertinent information: <br />After reviewing the attached schematics for the Horizontal Planar Near-Field/Compact Antenna Range (HPNF/CAR), provide specific details on implementation approaches of a HPNF/CAR within the available planned space. GRC currently has a 12' x 10' x 26' compact range with a 6' x 6&lsquo;cross-section blended edge offset parabolic reflector. The dimensions of the compact range are provided for information purposes and could be changed as needed as part of the process of creating the desired HPNF/CAR facility. <br />&#61656;	Technical details of the main space construction that would be key to integrating the HPNF/CAR equipment in it. For example, approximate column loads/weights for foundation design, vibration abatement approaches, thermal/humidity controls, and electrical requirements, among others.<br />&#61656;	Specific power requirements (voltage, amperage, etc.), recommended crane capacity (e.g. overhead bridge crane), lighting requirements, and any shielding or radiofrequency interference/electromagnetic interference (RFI/EMI) noise generation concerns.<br />&#61656;	Narrative describing a notional approach to design, fabrication, installing, activating and validating the HPNF/CAR systems.  This narrative should describe the key phases of a turn-key approach to the development and supply of these systems.  This narrative should also include a notional schedule (e.g. Gantt chart) illustrating these key phases and the expected durations.<br />&#61656;	Provide a typical flow of testing of a typical large-scale parabolic antenna,  from delivery to setup to testing to tear-down, that could provide a sense of door opening sizes, staging areas, etc. in the building design would be desirable.<br />&#61656;	Finally, provide rough order of magnitude (ROM) of the cost to make the HPNF/CAR facility operational. The cost elements should be identified (e.g. motion control system, scanner support structure, RF system/receiver, project management, error analysis of antenna ranges, other recommended accessories, etc.).  Having this ROM is critical for the internal advocacy of resources to furnish the ranges upon completion of the ACF facility.<br />4.0 Responses<br />4.1 Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI with a white paper.<br />4.2 White papers are due no later than&nbsp; November 14th, 2017, 12:00 am EST. Responses shall be limited to 10 pages and submitted via e-mail only to Jason Siewert. Proprietary information, if any, should be minimized and MUST BE CLEARLY MARKED. To aid the Government, please segregate proprietary information. Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned.<br />4.3. Section 1 of the white paper shall provide administrative information, and shall include the following as a minimum:<br />4.3.1. Name, mailing address, overnight delivery address (if different from mailing address), phone number, fax number, and e-mail of designated point of contact.<br />4.3.2. Recommended contracting strategy.<br />4.3.3. Either 1) copies of executed non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) with the contractors supporting NASA's ACF in technical evaluations or 2) a statement that the responding organization will not allow the Government to release its proprietary data to the Government support contractors. In the absence of either of the foregoing, the Government will assume that the responding organization does NOT agree to the release of its submission to Government support contractors.<br />4.3.4. Business type (large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a)-certified small disadvantaged business, HUBZone small business, woman-owned small business, very small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business) based upon North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)541712. "Small business concern" means a concern, including its affiliates that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the criteria and size standards in 13 CFR part 121. A small business concern for the purposes of this procurement is generally defined as a business, including its affiliates, averaging no more than 1000 employees. The number of employees of a concern is its average number of persons employed for each pay period over the concern's latest 12 months. Any person on the payroll must be included as one employee regardless of hours worked or temporary status. That is, it is a "head count." The number of employees of a concern in business under 12 months is based on the average for each pay period it has been in business. The responding organizations are cautioned, however, that this is a general description only. Additional standards and conditions apply. Please refer to Federal Acquisition Regulation FAR 19 for additional detailed information on Small Business Size Standards.<br />4.3.5 The facility security clearance of the offeror.<br />The number of pages in Section 1 of the white paper shall not be included in the 10-page limitation, i.e., the 10-page limitation applies only to Section 2 of the white paper.<br />4.4 Section 2 of the white paper shall answer the issues addressed in Section 3 of this RFI and shall be limited to 10 pages.</p>
<p>5.0 Industry Discussions</p>
<p>NASA GRC representatives may or may not choose to contact or meet with respondents. Such discussions would only be intended to get further clarification of potential capability to meet the requirements, especially any development and certification risks.</p>
<p>6.0 Questions</p>
<p>Questions regarding this announcement shall be submitted in writing by e-mail to the Contracting Officer, email address. Verbal questions will NOT be accepted. Questions shall NOT contain proprietary or classified information. The Government does not guarantee that questions received after November 7th, 2017 will be answered.</p>
<p>7.0 Summary<br /> THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY to identify sources that can provide Hybrid Planar Near-Field/Compact Antenna Range. The information provided in the RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. NASA GRC has not made a commitment to procure any of the items discussed, and release of this RFI should not be construed as such a commitment or as authorization to incur cost for which reimbursement would be required or sought. All submissions become Government property and will not be returned.</p>
