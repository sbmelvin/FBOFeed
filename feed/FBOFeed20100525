<DESC>The FAA issued RFI Announcement # 8825 in September 2009 for a Unified Contract System (UCS).  The FAA cancelled the RFI in December 2009 stating that further market research was necessary to support the UCS requirements definition.  Additional market research was conducted and the FAA has concluded that it may be possible to satisfy the UCS requirement through a BPMS-based solution.  A Screening Information Request (SIR) was issued on May 24, 2010, to satisfy the FAA ATO Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) requirement for an Enterprise BPMS solution.  The FAA plans to investigate the possibility of using [and reserves the right to use] the selected Business Process Management Suite (BPMS) (Solicitation # 9540) as a component in the development/ implementation of a Unified Contracting System (UCS).

In addition, it is underway to submit ajoint work for publication with AIAA Journal or Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets. It isalso planned to rename and release the FIT package to public in the form of a jointpresentation at an AIAA meeting followed by a journal publication in 2011.NASA/GRC intends to purchase the items/services from Portland State University.  Underthe authority of NASA FAR Reference 13.106-1(b)(1), Portland State University is the onlyresponsible source that will satisfy NASA's requirement.In 2006, NASA/GRC issued an order to Portland State University to conduct a low-gravityfluid study based on the minimal surface energy of liquids.  The successful outcome of that Phase 1 study led to the development and delivery of theFluid Interface Tool - a software tool that provides a user with a user-friendlyfront-end graphical user interface for implementing an algorithm based on the SurfaceEvolver code, which has been funded through a different follow-on order.Substantial progress was made this past year in development of the Fluid Interface Tool.Progress continues in developing a universal convergence scheme, an artificial velocitymethod for the fluid interface, file and script editors, pre-built geometries, andimplementation of a method to calculate centrifugal forces on the tank bases on userinput.NASA/GRC has determined that further development of the Fluid Interface Tool is warrantedand highly relevant to the Exploration program. Portland State University is uniquelyqualified to lead this development effort because of their experience in low-gravityfluid phenomena, experience in using the Surface Evolver code, and the very successfuldevelopment of the Fluid Interface Tool software product. They can build from theprevious Fluid Interface Tool product without having to repeat a significant amount ofdevelopment effort.

<p>Description</p>
<p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), plans to procure on a sole source basis services in support of the Ghana Study on Hormone Profiles from the Universite Laval, Pavillion Des Sciences De L'education; Room 1434; 2320 Rue Des Bibliotheques; Quebec; QC; G1V 0A6, CAN.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures in FAR Part 13.106 (b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System code is 541380 the business size standard is $12.0 million.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: Performance shall be for twelve (12) months from date of award.</p>
<p>The Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) is an intramural research program of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH) that conducts population and multidisciplinary research to discover the genetic and environmental determinants of cancer and new approaches to cancer prevention. The DCEG is carrying out studies to investigate reasons for the large prostate cancer risk in African Americans. As part of this research program, DCEG is conducting a population-based screening of males in Accra, Ghana, to investigate the burden of prostate disease in West Africans. Preliminary data suggests that there are differences in androgen profiles between Africans and African Americans. To clarify this information and the role of hormonal profiles in racial difference of prostate cancer, NCI plans to assay 550 samples, including Caucasian Americans, to ensure the power of the study and provide contrast between Africans, African Americans, and Caucasians. DCEG is also retesting estrogen readings in 66 samples where the original measures were invalid.</p>
<p>The contractor shall perform the following tasks:</p>
<p>&bull; Perform GC-MS to measure circulating levels of unconjugated hormones, including dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), androst-5-ene-3&szlig;, 17&szlig;-diol (A5-diol), androstenedione (4-dione), testosterone (T), androsterone (ADT), dihydrotestosterone (DHT), estrone (E1), and estradiol (E2)<br />&bull; Perform LC-MS assays to measure circulating levels of conjugated hormones, including androsterone glucuronide (ADT-G), 5&alpha;-androstane-3&alpha;, 17&szlig;-diol 3-glucuronide (3&alpha;-diol-3G), 5&alpha;-androstane-3&alpha;,17&szlig;-diol 17-glucuronide (3&alpha;-diol-17G), and estrone sulfate (E1S) <br />&bull; Pass the proofs of performance pilot test and maintain the high quality of these assays, as estimated by low levels of the coefficients of variation (CVs) and high levels of intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs). Keep the inter-assay CVs lower than 10% and ICCs higher than 85%.</p>
<p>Laval University is the only known laboratory in the world that can measure both 3 alpha-diol-3G and 3 alpha-diol-17G. Pilot testing at this lab to assess the reproducibility of the GC-MS assays shows very high reproducibility (&gt;99%) and the sensitivity and specificity of the assays are excellent. A large number of samples analyzed have been previously analyzed by Laval University, in order to avoid inter-laboratory variation, usage of the same laboratory is essential.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.

No electronic capability statements will be accepted (i.e. email or fax), an original and one copy must be sent to the NCI Office of Acquisition to the address stated above. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Terry Galloway, Contract Specialist at gallowaytl@mail.nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov.

<p>Description<br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), plans to procure on a sole source basis services from Brigham and Women's Hospital, Channing Laboratory, 181 Longwood Avenue, Boston, MA 02115</p>
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures in FAR Part 13.106 (b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System code is 541380 the business size standard is $12.0 million.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: Performance shall be for twelve (12) months from date of award.</p>
<p>The Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) is an intramural research program of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH) that conducts population and multidisciplinary research to discover the genetic and environmental determinants of cancer and new approaches to cancer prevention. NCI proposes to examine the association between telomere length and risk of glioma using leukocyte and buccal cell DNA samples from two studies with DCEG: the NCI Adult Brain Tumor Case-Control Study and the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial. In order to further assess the potential role of telomeres in glioma etiology, DCEG will examine whether telomere length variation is modified by TERT polymorphisms that are highly associated with glioma risk. Telomere length will be measured by Q-PCR of genomic DNA in glioma cancer cases and controls. Telomere length as a potential risk factor for glioma will be evaluated.</p>
<p>The contractor shall determine telomere length in 1,430 samples in triplicate, using Q-PCR assay. The contractor will also provide a plan for determining if the replicate values are in agreement. On repeated duplicate testing, the laboratory shall also provide a plan for determining if replicate values are in agreement.</p>
<p>The Channing Laboratory is the only organization known to NCI that has experience performing the telomere length analyses on DNA from cancer research studies that can meet the requirements of using only 150ng of DNA and testing many samples at one time (high-throughput). NCI is preparing to utilize this source to maintain continuity in a series of cancer research projects that have been conducted at NCI; the other cancers studies included gastric, melanoma and prostate to name a few, and avoid introducing new variables into the project. It is essential that all study samples be analyzed by the same laboratory to reduce laboratory variation. The proposed laboratory has documented proof of measuring telomere length with a high replication rate for testing the same sample twice or even three times, for other NCI cancer research studies.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.

<DESC><p><strong>THIS ACQUISITION IS BEING ADVERTISED UNDER FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.<br /></strong><br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), is seeking a qualified contractor to establish a Quality Management System (QMS) across the funded activities of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) program, with the goal of identifying non-conforming data in a timely fashion to ensure data released to the public is of the highest quality possible. TCGA is a comprehensive, collaborative effort led by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to map the genomic changes that occur in major types and subtypes of cancer. Researchers throughout the nation are using various genome analysis technologies, including high through-put DNA sequencing, to carry out this effort. A pilot project initiated in 2006, focused on three tumor types (brain, ovarian, and lung), established the scientific infrastructure and demonstrated the "proof of concept" needed to mount a large-scale cancer genome mapping project. Based on the success of the pilot, TCGA announced in September 2009 that it will map the genomes of at least 20 additional cancers over the next five years. To facilitate expansion of the program, TCGA will focus on quality as a best management practice, and is seeking a qualified Contractor to define and implement a QMS. These services will include, but are not limited to the following:</p>
<p>The Contractor shall establish TCGA-Quality Management (QM) policies, processes and procedures in line with the program organization goals, implement the QMS, and train the staff within the Biospecimen Core Resources (BCR) and the Data Coordinating Center (DCC). In addition, the Contractor shall provide a means to identify, track and report non-conforming data, establish and implement internal audit policies, processes, and methods to verify compliance with the QMS, and provide regular and detailed reports of the status of data quality at all stages in the TCGA workflow.</p>
<p>Key to the program will be the establishment of a process and system to ensure data completeness and quality. The Contractor shall establish a QMS congruent with the guidelines described by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) document HS1-A2, "A Quality Management System Model for Healthcare; Approved Guideline - Second Edition" (http://www.clsi.org/source/orders/index.cfm?section=Online_Store&amp;task=3&amp;CATEGORY=QM&amp;PRODUCT_TYPE=SALES&amp;SKU=HS01A2E). CLSI document HS1-A2 proposes Quality Management guidelines for organizations in the medical disciplines and these guidelines are based on a common set of 12 quality elements established by ISO 9001, typically referred to as Quality System Essentials (QSE). It is the intent of the TCGA Program Office to employ a minimal QMS based on 9 of the 12 QSEs. The Contractor shall define the quality policies, processes and procedures around these nine (9) QSEs as they relate to the TCGA program. The QSEs are (1) Documents and Records, (2) Organization, (3) Equipment, (4) Purchasing and Inventory, (5) Process Controls, (6) Information Management, (7) Occurrence Management, (8) Assessments, and (9) Customer Service. To overcome the late stage identification of non-conforming data, the Contractor shall provide a QMS that has the ability to implement a variety of workflow throughput measures and data quality checks across the BCR biospecimen repository, the clinical meta-data repository, and the data coordinating center. To support the regular data quality checks, the Contractor shall implement a QMS that, at a minimum, will provide the means to identify, manage, and track both throughput of samples and available data (including non-conforming data). Ideally, the QMS information management system (IMS) shall also support automated functions to reach into the various TCGA data repositories, perform a pre-defined list of data quality checks, capture the tests that passed and failed, and generate a summary report.</p>
<p>Request for Proposal (RFP) N02-CO-07030-36 will be available on or about June 10, 2010, and receipt for proposals will be due on or about 2:00 p.m., Eastern Prevailing Time on July 12, 2010.

<DESC>This is a Presolicitation notice for the previously posted Source Sought notice NIHES2010083 entitled Production of B6C3F1 Mice for NTP Studies.

The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences is soliciting proposals for the purpose of producing B6C3F1 mice for its National Toxicology Program.  The National Toxicology Program (NTP) within the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) is an interagency program whose mission is to evaluate agents of public health concern by developing and applying tools of modern toxicology and molecular biology. The program maintains an objective, science-based approach in dealing with critical issues in toxicology and is committed to using the best science available to prioritize, design, conduct, and interpret its studies.  The evaluation of chemicals and other agents is generally conducted through a sequence of studies, which involve the exposure of laboratory rodents to these agents.  Rats and mice are appropriate models for evaluating the toxicologic and carcinogenic potential of these compounds.  The NTP utilizes the B6C3F1 hybrid mouse and various rat stocks/strains to evaluate this potential.

The Contractor shall establish, operate and maintain rodent production colonies under strict barrier conditions in order to produce approximately 150 per sex of B6C3F1 mice at weekly intervals.   Additionally the contractor shall be able to produce up to 350 per sex of B6C3F1 mice at four to eight intervals as requested for a total of up to approximately 14,000 B6C3F1 mice per year for the NTP research and testing program.  To ensure continued production in the event of contamination, environmental systems failure, or natural disaster, geographically separate backup production colonies that can quickly be brought into production are required.

Specifically, the Contractor shall (1) maintain, operate and dedicate to the performance of this contract the necessary number of isolators and maximum barrier units or rooms.  Operational parameters require that all bedding, diet, cage units, and ancillary equipment be sterile; (2) rederive the C57BL/6N (e84) and C3H/HeN MTV- (e84) mice by embryo transfer or Cesarean section and establish defined micro-flora associated (modified Schaedler) foundation colonies to ensure an adequate and continuous supply of quality animals for the NTP testing program.  Offspring from these foundation colonies shall be used to establish expansion and/or production colonies to produce approximately 150 - 350 per sex of B6C3F1 mice; (3) demonstrate the capability to save embryos and sperm by cryopreservation; (4) assure nation-wide delivery of litters weaned by 21 days of age from the production colonies to the current, nine NTP end-user labs within 30 hours of having been shipped from the contractors facilities; (5) assure mice are free of viruses (PVM, Sendai, Parvo virus, (MMV, MPV), MHV, REO-3, LCMV, Hantaan, MaD, Polyoma, Ectromelia, EDIM, MNV), mycoplasma (Mycoplasma pulmonis, M. arthritidis, M. neurolyticum, M. muris), bacteria (Bordetella bronchiseptica, Corynebacterium kutscheri, Streptococcus pneumoniae, CAR Bacillus, Pasteurella pneumotropica, Streptobacillus moniliformis, Citrobacter rodentium, Clostridium piliforme,  Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus group D, Salmonella, , pathogenic Escherichia coli. pathogenic Helicobacter sp. such as H. hepaticus and H. bilis), protozoa (Hemobartonella, Eperythrozoon, Coccidia, Spironucleus, Giardia, Entamoeba, Trichomonas, Encephalitozoon, Toxoplasma), mycotic organisms (Microsporum, Trichophyton, Histoplasma, Coccidioides, Cryptococcus, Candida, Sporotrichium, Aspergillus, Pneumocystis), helminth parasites (Heterakis, Aspicularis, Syphacia, Trichinella, Capillaria, Trichosomoides, Nippostrongylus, Angiostronqylus, Gongylonema, Moniliformis, Rodentolepis, Hymenolepis, Oochoristica, Cysticercus, Coenurus), ectoparasites (Radfordia, Psorergates, Ornithonyssus, Myocoptes, Myobia, Notoedres, Polyplax); (6) evaluate 5 per sex of the retired breeders and weanlings of the foundation, expansion, and production colonies for microbial status and health status at 4-week intervals; (7) provide total support for genetic monitoring of the foundation and expansion colonies and monitor the genetic status of the retired breeders and/or weanlings.  Documented breeding schemes used to produce genetically defined animals shall be designed to assure the homogeneity of the hybrid B6C3F1 mouse and the integral structure of the colony; (8) review the management of the colonies at least once per year by a qualified animal geneticist.

Mandatory Requirements
The Contractor shall have a PHS Assurance from the NIH Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW), and shall be accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC).  All facilities, practices and procedures of husbandry, care and maintenance of animals used in the performance of this contract shall be in accordance with the latest issue in effect of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.  The Contractor shall have an active integrated pest management (IPM) program to prevent the introduction of pathogenic agents to animals housed in the isolator/barrier facilities.  Failure to meet the minimum mandatory requirements will render the Offerors proposal non-responsive and it will not be considered for award

One contract will be awarded.  The anticipated period of performance is a base year with four option years.  The Government estimate of direct labor is 12,700 hours per year.  The Government anticipates the participation of a Principal Investigator, Project Director, Animal Geneticist, and Animal Care Technicians.  The anticipated award date is December 1, 2010.  This is a full and open competitive requirement.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code identified for this requirement is 112990 with a size standard of $0.75 million.

<DESC>INSTALLATION OF RAINBOW TURF(or equal)  RUBBER WALKING SURFACE(including excavation, site preparation, materials and installation) 

I. BACKGROUND
The Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve, a unit of the National Park Service, is located within Duval and Nassau Counties in Northwest Florida.  Kingsley Plantation is a historical site with the Preserve. 
The Kingsley Plantation has national and international significance in the interpretation of slavery and race relations in Spanish Florida and the United States. Kingsley is the oldest existing plantation in Florida and is on the historic Register.
During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, many people came to Florida. Some, like Zephaniah Kingsley, sought to make their fortunes by obtaining land and establishing plantations. Others forced to come to Florida to work on those plantations, their labor providing wealth to the people who owned them. Some of the enslaved would later become free landowners, struggling to keep their footing in a dangerous time of shifting alliances and politics. All of these people played a part in the history of Kingsley Plantation.
Kingsley Plantation symbolizes a time and a place in history. More than that, Kingsley Plantation represents people, free and enslaved, ordinary and extraordinary, and their efforts to survive in a changing land. The stories of these often-heroic people and their contributions to history can be explored at Kingsley Plantation.
The National Park Service contracted an exhibit planning and design firm to design the park's indoor and outdoor exhibits. The final exhibit plan incorporates a pathway, gathering areas in an outdoor setting, which will be installed under this Task Order.
II. PURPOSE
The purpose of this contract is to install Rainbow Turf brand rubber walking surfaces (including excavation, site preparation, materials and installation) at Kingsley Plantation, Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve, located on Fort George Island at 11676 Palmetto Avenue, Jacksonville, Florida 32226.

<DESC>The U.S. Navy is conducting a Request for Information (RFI) to determine availability of software that processes a complex data stream provided by the Reconnaissance Airborne Pod for TORnado (RAPTOR) that is carried by the GR-4 aircraft operated by the Royal Air Force (RAF). The software must either be:
1)	Portable to Navy-owned personal computer based imagery processing system;
                    Or
2)	Convertible via re-compilation, and deliverable as source code. 
It is assumed that the software will operate in a ground station (GS) and be used to convert signal data received over a digital radio frequency (RF) link, i.e., data link, into pixel and support data for images in a STANAG (Standard NATO Agreement) or National Imagery Transmission Format (NITF) type file. The Navy's objective is to utilize any prior development of such software that would facilitate its conversion to, and implementation within a Distributed Common Grown System (DCGS) that could be deployed globally, both afloat and ashore. The submission of this information is for planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to procure any items/services, or for the Government to pay for information received.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) items or slightly modified COTS items under FAR Part 13 prepared in accordance with the format prescribed in Subpart 12.6 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.This announcement constitutes the request for quote for the required items under Request for Quote (RFQ) N61331-10-T-0010.  A subsequent solicitation document will not be issued.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-38.     The applicable FSC is 6605, the NAICS Code is 334511, and the small business size standard is 750 employees.
The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) intends to award, on a sole source basis, a firm-fixed price commercial item order to Dukane Corporation, 2900 Dukane Drive, St Charles, IL for the acquisition of two hundred (200) each Beacons, PN: DK187/3_1, for the MK 74 and MK 75 versions of the Versatile Exercise Mine System (VEMS).  The beacons are physically installed on the VEMS system so that the VEMS can be located and recovered after use.  This procurement is sole source for the following reasons.  These beacons are an integrated part of the VEMS system and are the only beacons capable of operating with the existing hardware and software already designed into the system to allow for operation of equipment in an unfriendly environment.  Once a system is certified, nothing can be altered without further costly certification testing and approval.  Additionally, specific commands for location and recovery of the VEMS system are incorporated into the existing system, requiring the identical beacons for plug-and-play operation. There are no other beacons that can operate with the VEMS off-the-shelf.  This is a follow-on contract for the production of highly specialized equipment within the exact meaning of FAR 6.302-1(a) (2) (ii). Use of any other vendor would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that, given the limited number of items being acquired, would not be recovered through competition.  Delivery is required within 120 days after contract award.

<a href="mailto:charlton.candice@epa.gov">CANDICE R. CHARLTON</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is seeking a contractor to provide technical support for the BASINS (Better Assessment Science Integrating point and Nonpoint Sources) Application and the Water Quality Standards Program in support of the Standards and Health Protection Division (SHPD), under the Office of Science and Technology (OST) within EPA?s Office of Water (OW).SHPD has multiple responsibilities under the Clean Water Act of 1987 (CWA) to include directing the national program for adoption of Water Quality Standards, developing prevention and remediation strategies to reduce the risk to human health and aquatic life resulting from contaminated fish and sediment, and microbial pathogens in surface waters, providing technical support to the Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) program, and preparing outreach and awareness materials including developing instructional material and presenting workshops.  Many of SHPD?s efforts have benefited from the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technologies, which captures, stores, analyzes, manages, and presents data that are linked to a location; particularly as implemented in the application known as BASINS.  Over the past decade OW has managed the development of GIS technologies, capabilities, and databases to support programmatic activities.   The wide availability of GIS compatible data makes it possible to provide more complete data support for many water quality and watershed models which, assess and simulate water quality and flow, by linking the GIS-based data to the models integrated in BASINS.  The PC-based GIS system is designed to be used by managers and analysts who need to work with spatial data but do not need to perform the more complex GIS manipulations. EPA has used such a system with appropriate GIS data layers and models to develop the BASINS application, which is useful in assessing the integrated effects of point and nonpoint pollutants releases on water quality.  BASINS provides techniques that may be used in many ways including selecting industries for study, delineating impacted aquatic ecosystems, prioritizing regulatory options, developing watershed assessments and nonpoint source controls, facilitating watershed-level National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permitting, and contributing to overall programmatic management.Technical support services in the following task areas will be necessary for this effort:1.	Professional programming assistance for the BASINS application support and development including model interface development, model development, data compilation, and GIS technologies.2.	Providing workshops, training, and logistical support specific to the various models and related computer operations3.	Technical support/instruction to the users of models and modeling applications. 4.	Develop methodologies and identify and obtain requisite data layers to fully support watershed assessment modeling analyses using BASINS technologies as appropriate5.	Technical support for internet and intranet applications such as developing web pages/sites, updating web-based materials, and other web-based features as appropriate to the support of the BASINS list serveThe successful contractor of any resultant contract will be expected to provide all necessary labor, materials, and facilities in support of the efforts delineated by the Performance Work Statement (PWS).Solicitation PR-CI-10-10542 will appear on the internet and it may be accessed through the EPA?s home page on the World Wide Net (www.epa.gov).  It is the responsibility of interested offerors to download the solicitation and any subsequent amendments from the website and to frequently check the FEDBizOpps (www.fbo.gov) or the EPA website address for updates or changes.  See EPA Cincinnati website, http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd  for posted draft Performance Work Statement.  Be advised, Performance Work Statement changes are possible when final Request For Proposal (RFP) is released.   The direct link URL for the RFP when issued is http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd.  It is anticipated that this solicitation will be issued on or around July 1, 2010 and that proposals will be requested in 30 days after issuance of the solicitation.  All responsible sources that submit a proposal will be considered by the agency. This procurement will be issued as a small business set-aside.  As a reminder, small businesses are required to perform at least 50 percent of the costs of the contract performance with their own personnel (FAR 52.219-14).   The Government anticipates that any future contract for these services will be an Indefinite-Delivery/ Indefinite-Quantity (ID/IQ) type contract with a five year ordering period.  Both Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee and Firm-Fixed Price task orders may be issued under any resultant contract. The applicable NAICS code is 541611 (Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services) with a size standard of $7 million.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This is a pre-solicitation notice issued in accordance with FAR 5.201 and FAR 5.201. It does not constitute a formal solicitation, Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue a formal solicitation, RFP or Broad Area Announcement (BAA). The primary purpose of this notice is to improve small business access to acquisition information and enhance competition. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay any cost incurred in response to this synopsis and all costs associated with responding will be solely at the interested parties' expense. Not responding to this synopsis does not preclude participation in any future and potential solicitation, or RFP.  If a formal solicitation is released, it will be issued via the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) Acquisition Business Web Site (https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/) and posted on the Federal Business Opportunities (https: //www.fbo.gov) web site. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these websites for any information that may pertain to this synopsis. The information provided in this synopsis is subject to change and is not binding on the Government.<BR><BR>This requirement is for onsite and offsite technical support to the NGIC Signatures Division in its Measurement And Signature Intelligence (MASINT) areas of responsibility: collection, modeling, processing, analyzing, and dissemination of signatures. The Signatures Division produces and analyzes collected data to determine the signatures of foreign materiel primarily in the infrared, radar, acoustic, infrasonic, magnetic, electromagnetic, and seismic spectrums/modalities. Computer Aided Design (CAD) modeling and predictive codes are also used as a source for determining signatures.  Scientific and technical intelligence products are in the area of MASINT via ground systems, rotor systems, and munitions.<BR>The objective of this requirement is to procure support in three key areas. Staffing requires two Full Time Equivalent (FTE) covering the infrared and geophysical engineering support, another FTE covering the collection in electro-optic and geophysical (seismic, acoustics, magnetics, infrasonic, and electromagnetic emissions) collection, and a fourth FTE with responsibilities in CAD modeling and predictive codes in the infrared. Two additional personnel may be required to provide support in any of the above disciplines but mainly will provide support to Signatures Division in the functionality of web publisher, hardware/software interfacing, software programming, or engineering code programming. <BR><BR>The following list of specific tasks represents the present work requirements of the Signatures Division but may not be totally inclusive of future needs.<BR>a.	Collection Support in Electro-Optic Infrared and Geophysical Field Measurements. <BR>b.	CAD Modeling/Predictive Code Support<BR>c.	Processing Support<BR>d.	Analysis Support<BR>e.	Software Coding Support<BR>f.	Electronic Web Publishing and Programming Support<BR>g.	MASINT Collection Training Support<BR>h.	Signatures Division Representation Support<BR><BR>Contractor personnel are expected to reside on-site at NGIC when not on a collection mission. Certain tasks such as computer programming may take place at the Contractor's site as needed. Off-site collection missions are primarily performed at test ranges in the continental United States but may take place in countries that do not have well-developed medical facilities. Additionally, some collection activities require maneuvering over large vehicles while collecting measurements or documenting the target configuration and so the personnel assigned must be physically fit and in good health.   <BR><BR>The proposed contract vehicle will be a single-award Indefinite Delivery/ Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract with one base year and four option years. Specific tasks to be performed under this contract and their deliverables shall be specified by the individual orders. <BR><BR>Sources must be able to work at the TOP SECRET//Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) level.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Natick Soldier RD&E Center (NSRDEC) is seeking information on emerging technologies and technology concepts designed to physically or mentally unburden the Soldier and Small Combat Unit (SCU) of the future. Information received from this notice will be used to identify prospective participants in an Emerging Soldier Technologies (EST) Workshop to be conducted in late June, 2010 in conjunction with a Future Soldier Initiative (FSI) Capability Exercise (CapEx).<BR>NSRDECs mission is to maximize the Warfighters Survivability, Sustainability, Mobility, Combat Effectiveness and Quality of Life by treating the Warfighter as a System. NSRDECs Future Soldier Initiative (FSI) explores science and technologys role in enabling future capabilities for full spectrum operations with a focus on capabilities that Empower, Unburden, and Protect the Soldier and Small Combat Unit. .<BR>The FSI is charged with igniting the imagination and sparking discussion on how current and emerging research can best be directed to provide the Soldier and SCUs with unmatched capabilities that will help ensure success in future conflicts. The FSI objectives are pursued, in part, through a Capability Exercise (CapEx process that utilizes structured scenarios to guide the exploration of current and future capabilities by examining the actions and reactions of representative Soldiers, opposition forces, and the local populations within various defined parameters.<BR>The government will invite selected respondents to participate in an EST Workshop tentatively scheduled for 29-30 June 2010 at the Natick Soldier Systems Center in Natick, MA. During the Workshop, invitees will be invited to demonstrate their emerging technology or technology concept for a selected audience of Soldiers, CapEx participants, and government personnel. Invitees will also participate in roundtable discussions regarding Unburdening Soldiers and SCUs. [Note: The Government will not reimburse any business concern invited to participate in the workshop for costs associated with their invitation to or participation in the Workshop.]<BR>Unburdening technologies include those technologies, which, if implemented, would significantly reduce or off-load the physical or cognitive load placed on a Soldier/SCU, or increase the Soldier/SCU capacity to accept and process physical or cognitive load. Respondents to this request should submit technology concepts with potential to Unburden individual Soldiers or SCUs that are in the form of a prototype or other technology demonstrator that can be used to demonstrate the concept to Soldiers.<BR>Responses to this request must not exceed 10 pages (the Government may not review additional pages) and should address the following information: <BR>(1)	Description: Describe the emerging technology and how a Soldier or SCU would potentially use the technology in an operational setting. <BR>(2)	Impact: What is the anticipated impact of the technology on Soldiers/SCUs physical and cognitive load (please address each separately)? Please quantify your response to the maximum extent possible.<BR>(3)	Prototype: Is a prototype or other technology demonstrator available to demonstrate the proposed technology? Please provide photographs or video as applicable. Minimum and desired space requirements for demonstration should also be included for workshop logistical planning purposes. <BR>(4)	Availability: What is the availability of the prototype or technology demonstrator and necessary support personnel to attend the June, 2010 EST Workshop? <BR>(5)	Current Customers: If applicable, please provide information on current customers for the proposed or closely related technology, including development/prototype efforts.<BR>(6)	Contact Information: Please include a point of contact including email address, telephone number, and mailing address. <BR>NSRDEC personnel will review responses for suitability and applicability to the CapEx scenario and Unburdening theme. The Government, based on the objectives and criteria of this request, will make a determination as to a technologys suitability for invitation to the EST Workshop. The Government reserves the right to limit the number of invitations for participation in the Workshop based on resource and other limitations. Submissions may also be considered for invitation to participate in similar Workshops in the future at the Governments discretion.<BR>Submission of information in response to this request is completely voluntary. The Government will not reimburse any business concern for any information submitted in response to this notice. Respondents are encouraged to submit only non-proprietary information, as the EST workshop will be attended by other non-governmental invitees. If proprietary information is submitted for review in response to this request for information, it must be marked appropriately, and the respondent should specify how it will present its technology at the Workshop without reference to proprietary data, which cannot be protected at the Workshop due to the presence of non-governmental personnel.<BR><BR>The information provided in response to this request for information will be used to identify potential invitees to participate in the outlined EST Workshop. As indicated above, the Government will not reimburse any business concern invited to participate in the Workshop for costs associated with such participation. No acquisition will result specifically from this notice or the follow-on workshop; however, future acquisitions may reflect performance capabilities identified during the contemporaneous CapEx, if such capabilities warrant further investigation or development. Response to this notice does not ensure an invitation to participate will be extended.<BR>All interested business concerns are required to respond to this request for information announcement via email no later than 4 June 2010, 2:00 p.m. EST. Attachments to submissions (e.g. optional video) larger than 5 MB shall be coordinated with the Government by email and submitted by internet link (provided via email), or electronic media (CD, DVD). Responses must include company point of contact, email address, telephone number, mailing address and fax numbers.

PROJECT DETAILS
This project is located within Tonto National Forest between Apache Junction, AZ and Roosevelt Dam.  Apache Trail (SR88/FH49) is a designated scenic byway and historic road that travels some of the most rugged terrain in Arizona.  This unpaved road varies from 12 to 22 feet in width.

The project consists of 5 separate sites within a 2 mile stretch near Fish Creek Canyon, between Tortilla Flats and Apache Lake.  Access to the project sites will be from both the west (Apache Junction/Tortilla Flats) and east (SR88/SR188 intersection).  Planning and staging of the work between the 5 sites will be critical to successfully complete the work in the limited timeframe.  In addition, this project requires technical expertise in compaction grouting, as well as specialized stone masonry work.  A description of each project site and approximate quantities is as follows:

Wall 1 work consists of compaction grouting, stone masonry wall repairs, and drainage work.  Wall 1 will require approximately 22 cubic yards of cement grout, 190 linear feet of grout piping, 8 square yards of stone masonry repair, 70 square yards of clay ditch liner, 100 linear feet of ditch reconditioning, and 10 cubic yards of grouted riprap.

Wall 2 work consists of construction of a 6 to 18 high reinforced concrete retaining wall with stone masonry facing and drainage work.  Wall 2 will require approximately 2,700 square feet of retaining wall, 300 square yards of stone masonry facing, and 250 linear feet of ditch reconditioning.

Wall 3 work consists of compaction grouting, stone masonry wall repairs, and drainage work.  Wall 3 will require approximately 100 cubic yards of cement grout, 1000 linear feet of grout piping, 50 square yards of stone masonry repair, and 200 linear feet of ditch reconditioning.

Site 1 work consists of construction of an 8 high reinforced concrete retaining wall, a reinforced soil slope, and selective tree clearing.  Wall at Site 1 will require approximately 2,300 square feet of retaining wall.  Reinforced soil slope at Site 1 will require 430 square yards of geogrid, 170 cubic yards of excavation, and 170 cubic yards of unclassified borrow.

Site 2 work consists of construction of a 10 to 13 high reinforced soil slope and drainage work.  Site 2 will require approximately 1,500 square yards of geogrid, 450 cubic yards of excavation, 450 cubic yards of unclassified borrow, 40 cubic yards of riprap, and 100 linear feet of ditch reconditioning.

In addition to the main roadway work, there will be temporary traffic control, construction surveying, temporary erosion control, and contractor testing.
It is anticipated that this project will be advertised in mid July, 2010 with construction occurring from October 2010 to January 2011.

Estimated cost $1.5 to $3.5 million.

<DESC>NOTICE: THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. The information provided in response to this notice will assist the Government in identifying sources that are capable of furnishing the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) with the requirements below.
<p>The National Marine Mammal Laboratory (NMML), Alaska Fisheries Science Center, National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), conducts research and monitoring on bearded, spotted, ringed, and ribbon seals, species that are protected under the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act and considered for listing as threatened or endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA). All four species are associated with sea ice during parts of the year, especially during their reproductive periods. Major breeding areas of all four species are found in the western Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk, within the Exclusive Economic Zone of the Russian Federation. The population sizes in these areas, which are fundamental numbers for evaluating the species' status under the ESA, are extremely imprecise, outdated, or simply unknown.</p>
<p>This work will provide critically needed estimates of the abundance of ice-associated seals in the Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk. Aerial photographic and multi-spectral surveys of seals on sea ice will be designed and conducted. The multi-spectral imagery will be analyzed for numbers and densities of seals, by species. NMML scientists will combine these results with independent estimates of the proportions of the populations in the water during the aerial surveys (and unavailable for counting) to obtain estimates of total abundance with adequate precision for ESA status evaluations and detection of future population changes in response to climate warming and loss of sea ice.</p>
<p>Approximately 23,500 km of aerial, multi-spectral survey track line will be required in a spring (April-May 2011) survey period. The exact target for track lengths and locations will be determined jointly by the contractor and NMML scientists in a survey design process that considers typical density estimates of these species found in similar surveys conducted recently in U.S. waters. Two workshops will be held to facilitate and review the survey design process.</p>
<p>The contractor must provide a team with demonstrated experience in multi-spectral (e.g., high-resolution visible, infrared, and ultraviolet) remote sensing of seals on sea ice, and a proven ability to implement a systematic and comprehensive survey of a large region such as an Arctic or sub-Arctic sea. The contractor shall be required to submit draft and final reports describing the methods and results of the surveys, as well as copies of all data including survey images, track line navigation data, and associated survey covariates such as weather conditions.</p>
<p>The contractor must have personnel who are fluent in spoken and written Russian and English, familiar with the vocabulary of marine mammalogy, experienced in the methods for surveying seals, and familiar with the geography of the Russian Far East. The contractor must have a demonstrated ability to obtain the appropriate Russian permits. The NMML does not have the resources or the personnel on staff to conduct this type of work in Russian waters nor are U.S. aircraft and vessels allowed to work in Russian waters.</p>
<p>In addition, the contractor will be responsible for assisting NMML scientists in the presentation of scientific information at Russian meetings.</p>
<p><br />Equipment and Materials:</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide all equipment and materials required to perform the operations and services.<br /><br />Observation/Monitoring:</p>
<p>The contractor will be responsible for:</p>
<p>1. Convening and hosting a two-day workshop on survey design. NMML scientists will meet with the contractor team to optimize the survey coverage, balancing the need for statistical precision with known or estimated factors for capabilities of available survey aircraft, resolution and coverage of remote sensing devices, typical weather patterns, and patterns of seal behavior (haul-out times). This workshop should be held, if possible, in conjunction with a U.S.-Russia Area 5 Marine Mammals Working Group meeting in Kaliningrad, Russia, October 2010, that will be attended by NMML scientists involved in this project (travel costs for NMML scientists will be reduced by combining the meetings).<br />2. Providing a draft survey plan based on the outcome of the workshop and subsequent calculations of expected survey coverage and precision (due July 31, 2011). NMML scientists will review the draft survey plan and provide requests for revision by September 30, 2011. <br />3. Conducting a comprehensive survey in April and May, 2012, of the Sea of Okhotsk and western Bering Sea ice-covered areas.<br />4. Providing a draft report on the 2012 survey, including any technical or logistical difficulties encountered and proposed solutions feasible for implementation in future surveys (October 15, 2012).<br />5. Convening and hosting a second two-day workshop in Russia to review the results of the survey and ensure a thorough understanding by NMML scientists of the details of the survey and image processing methods (October or November 2012) <br />6. Preparing a draft final report describing the methods and results of the surveys, as well as copies of all data including survey images, track line navigation data, and associated survey covariates such as weather conditions (April 30, 2013). NMML scientists will review the report for clarity and accuracy, and provide comments to the contractor (June 30, 2013).<br />7. Preparing a final report on the surveys (August 31, 2013).<br />8. Assisting NMML (U.S.) scientists with presentations of the study plans, results, and related information to meetings in Russia, including the regularly-scheduled Holarctic Conferences on Marine Mammals.</p>
<p>Note: Contractor is responsible for obtaining any aircraft, vessels, permits, and other logistical needs necessary to successfully fulfill the requirements of this statement of work.</p>
<p>Travel:</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide all travel for all field activities including mobilization, aerial surveys, and demobilization. The Government will provide travel for NMML scientists to attend workshops for survey design and review.</p>
<p><br />Milestones:</p>
<p>Oct. 2010 Convene survey design workshop in Kaliningrad, Moscow, or St. Petersburg.</p>
<p>Jan. - Jul. 2011 Prepare and submit draft survey plan</p>
<p>Sep. 2011 NMML reviews and provides comments on draft survey plan</p>

<DESC><br />The 802d Contracting Squadron is intending to award a sole source purchase order to Panama City Cycles to purchase two (2) 2009 SHO Wave Runners.<br />This purchase will be made under simplified acquisition procedures and Other than Full and Open Competition as authorized by FAR 6.302-1. The anticipated award date is 28 May 2010. This notice is neither a request for competitive proposals nor a solicitation of offers. A determination by the government not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The intent of this procurement is to award based on Sole Source requirement. <br />This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-41, and DFARS Change Notice 20100519, Standard Industrial Code 5551, North American Industry Classification System Code 441221 and Size Standard of $7.0M apply to this procurement. For questions regarding this purchase, please contact A1C Daughtrey at (210) 671-1748, e-mail: jessie.daughtrey@us.af.mil. Contracting Officer Mrs. Shirley M. Henderson, (210) 671-5165, e-mail: shirley.henderson@us.af.mil. <br />The following FAR clauses and provisions apply to this requirement: 52-211-17 Delivery of Excess Quantities, 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions, 52.212-5 (DEV) Full text Contract terms and Conditions required to Implement Statues or Executive Orders - commercial items, 52.247-34 - FOB Destination, 52.252-2 Clause Incorporated by Reference available at http://farsite.af.mil or www.arnet.gov, 52.252-6 Authorized Deviation in Clauses, 252.204-7004 Required CCR Registration, 252.212-7001 - (DEV) Contract Terms and Conditions, 252.232-7003 Electronic Submission of Payment Request. <br />The Government intends to evaluate and award without discussions on this procurement. The intent of this procurement is to award based on sole source requirement. Quotes are not being requested and written solicitation will not be used. The justification for this sole source procurement is that Panama City Cycles is the only wave runner dealership within 50 miles of station. Due to service and maintenance requirements, purchasing the wave runners from another dealership is not practable, as a mechanical failure could impair the mission due to having to transport the water craft for repair.<br />

<a href="mailto:EC_helpdesk@NBC.GOV">Point of Contact above, or if none listed, contact the IDEAS EC HELP DESK for assistance</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, Upper Colorado Region intends to award a sole source contract to Overton Power District No. 5 (OPD5).
The project consists of relocating approximately 1.5 miles of high-voltage electrical transmission line around a topographically low area to avoid permanent flooding that will occur due to the future construction of a fish barrier on the Virgin River.  Work will include delineating the new alignment, performing the necessary environmental studies, obtaining a new right-of-way from the Bureau of Land Management, and relocating the power line.
A Justification and Approval is being processed for this requirement. The Government anticipates awarding a firm fixed-price contract. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 237130 (Power and Communication Line and Related Structures Construction). This requirement is intended as a sole source contract due to the fact that the lines are owned by OPD5, and OPD5 has a longstanding policy prohibiting outside vendors from performing work on their power transmission lines.
All interested parties must respond within 15 days of the appearance of this notice in FedBizOpps. To be considered, interested offerors must submit technical literature describing their capability to effectively satisfy this requirement, as well as terms and conditions and a complete price quote within 15 days of this notice, to the following electronic mail address: tworthington@usbr.gov. 
No solicitation exists and requests for a copy of a solicitation will be disregarded unless one is subsequently issued. All responses from responsible sources will be fully considered. As a result of analyzing responses to this synopsis of intent, the Contracting Officer may determine that a solicitation will be issued. If such a solicitation is issued, an additional synopsis may be published. Any such solicitation that will be open to competition will be issued on FedBizOpps in order to permit firms to respond.

<p>1. Introduction <br />This Request for Information lists the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency's (NGA) requirements for Leadership, Supervisory and Professional Development training support within its Human Development (HD) Directorate, James R. Clapper School of Leadership and Professional Development (SLPD). The SLPD is looking to modernize its programs (both curriculum content and delivery strategies) and move to commercially available learning solutions.</p>
<p>This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, NGA is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Interested parties are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>2. Background<br />NGA provides geospatial-intelligence imagery, imagery intelligence, and geospatial data and information for planning, decision-making and action in support of national security.

The NGA workforce is defined for this effort as Pay Bands 2, 3, 4, and 5 (comparable to General Schedule (GS) grades 2 - 15), and senior executives.</p>
<p>The SLPD provides the NGA workforce with Leadership, Supervisory and Professional Development Training. The SLPD seeks information from which to modernize, maintain, and provide this training to the NGA workforce. The NGA is looking to purchase pre-existing courses that will require minimal modification to meet its training mission. The courses may be commercially available or internal to the company.</p>
<p>Based on the information received from this RFI, NGA will build a Request for Proposal. At this time NGA is envisioning a multiple award Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity task order contract where Sections 2, 3, 4, and 5 of Attachment 1 will be individual task orders; offerors may receive one or more of the task orders. NGA envisions 4 task orders but the analysis of industry responses to this RFI may lead to adjusting the number of task orders, as the NGA seeks to provide the best instruction at the best price to its work force.</p>
<p>3. Responding to this RFI</p>
<p>NGA requests that you provide the following information:</p>
<p>a. A response no longer than 5 double-sided pages exclusive of existing marketing materials. Only electronic submissions will be accepted.

In addition to the response to the RFI (which is a maximum of 5 double-sided pages), you also should provide a 1-2 page response to this acquisition strategy detailing what you see as the strengths and weaknesses of this approach. This information will be used by the government program manager to refine the approach for the final request for proposal.</p>
<p>b. Pre-existing internal and external marketing materials for each proposed courses. For internal courses, in lieu of formal marketing material, interested parties may submit E-mails, flyers, etc., that they use to attract internal candidates for the courses. For each course, respond with the instructors' qualifications required to teach the course (i.e., education level and experience).</p>
<p>c. The recommended number of students per iteration for each proposed course</p>
<p>d. The length (hours of instruction) of each proposed course.</p>
<p>e. The size of your company, large or small. If a small business, add in your Small Business Administration Status. The NAICS code is 611430, Professional and Management Development Training.</p>
<p>f. The current market price for pre-existing courses using pre-existing pricing materials. This information will be used to develop the government's independent cost estimate only.</p>
<p>g. A response indicating which task orders can be combined, if any.</p>

<DESC>This notice is issued by the Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division (NAVEODTECHDIV) on behalf of the Department of Defense (DoD) Joint IED Defeat Organization.   NAVEODTECHDIV is hereby posting a Request for Information (RFI) to solicit responses from interested parties for dismounted Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronics Warfare (CREW) systems performance improvements. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, QUOTATION, OR INVITATION FOR BID NOTICE. The document is for information and planning purposes and to allow industry the opportunity to verify reasonableness and feasibility of the requirement, as well as promote competition. The Government has a desire to investigate system level hardware that will provide near term improved performance over current systems capabilities.  Improved capabilities shall be defined as those that exceed the requirements defined in the CREW 3.1 specification.  The overarching area of interest is reduction in system weight.  Secondary areas of interest in priority order are reduction in system size, increase in system effectiveness range, and reduction/elimination of noise generated by system fans.  Respondents shall address how improvements to secondary areas of interest affect system weight.  The Government will also consider hardware that addresses unique operational or employment concepts.  It is requested that white papers be submitted that fully describe the capabilities and/or performance improvements in as much detail as possible.  It is requested that the white paper quantify the expected performance improvement and provide a reference for comparison (current system or specification reference).  The proposed improvements should also describe and quantify the impact or effect to, or on, all other system parameters (i.e., whether this improvement results in a change in size, weight, protection zone, mission time, cost, form factor, etc).  Based on the submissions, the Government may elect to conduct one-on-one discussions with Industry based on its analysis of the RFI responses, the quality of submission, and the level and specification of the information provided.    This may include visits to contractor's facilities to assess first hand the validity of described capabilities.  A laboratory demonstration at the contractor facility may also be requested.  The purpose of the discussions/site visit will be to assess the validity of the vendor's assertions regarding improved performance.  Those capabilities that show promise may be selected for additional testing at Government locations.  The additional testing will be pursued outside of this RFI.   Test results from closed loop or range testing will be releasable to DoD activities and JIEDDO staffs from Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom.   Please note the Government is under no obligation to conduct these sessions, nor is it liable for any costs or expenses incurred in replying to this RFI.  The information provided in response to this RFI will be used to support on-going initiatives within DoD to analyze emerging requirements for dismounted CREW systems and ultimately may result in the Government developing and issuing a RFP for respondents. 
Response Date:  Parties may begin submitting responses to this request for information immediately.  Submissions are due by 1600 hours Eastern Daylight Time on 16 July 2010.  Responses received after 16 July 2010, will be reviewed on six month intervals for the next two years.  Final review of submissions will be conducted 30 July 2012.    Responses shall be sent via email to:   Omar Roque at omar.roque@navy.mil.

<DESC>This notice is provided for informational purposes only.  This opportunity is available only to Program Support Center (PSC) Task Order Holders.

This is an American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) procurement.  Pursuant to FAR Part 52.201-11, American Recovery and Reinvestment Act  Reporting Requirements (MAR 2009), the Contractor is required to register by July 1, 2010 and file their fist report by July 10, 2010 at www.federalreporting.gov. 

The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation intends to award one task order under the PSC Task Orders.  

The purpose of this project is to use case studies to analyze six examples of CER dissemination and adoption of findings that propose actions contrary to practice current at the time.  At least two examples will be instances where the proposed course of action could logically lead to lower income for the provider.  At least one of the examples should be of an instance in which the dissemination was not successful in conveying new information to health care professionals and/or patients and potential patients in ways that promoted adoption.  Lack of success will be defined by considering both whether the CER recommendations were generally adopted into practice, and also by considering the extent of public clamor and the clarity of the public discussion following release of the recommendations.  The analysis of how the dissemination was conducted in the case studies and the extent to which CER findings are adopted will contribute to a report with specific, step-by-step  lessons learned, including suggestions for the methods to explain findings to health professionals and the public, dissemination approaches, and strategies that promote adoption , as well as  a related journal article

The period of performance of the resultant task order will be for 1 year from the date of award.
The RFQ will be issued to the PSC Task Order Holders on or about May 25, 2010.
The RFQ closing date is June 14, 2010.

<DESC>INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE.  The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs (ASPA), through the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Program Support Center (PSC), Division of Acquisition Management (DAM), intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with Bulletin News, 11190 Sunrise Valley Drive, Suite 130, Reston, VA 20191, TO INCREASE THE LEVEL OF EFFORT ON ITS CURRENT CONTRACT, number HHSP23320095658WC, for option years 1 through 4.  The statutory authority is 10 USC 2304(c), as set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  

ASPA is seeking to add additional services, for the FDA agency, to the scope of work of its existing contract with Bulletin News to provide media monitoring and analysis services of Department-wide related news.  While it includes some FDA news, the U.S. Food and Drug Administrations would like an additional, separate daily report by Bulletin News to provide more in-depth coverage of national news, trade outlets, journals and blogs covering FDA actions.  A responsibility of the U.S. Food and Drug Administrations (FDA) Office of Public Affairs is to provide the Commissioner and agency leadership and staff with the latest analysis of what the media is reporting about FDA priorities, initiatives and programs. Traditionally, the FDA has sought to provide this in a daily news briefing by simply providing collections of daily news clips distributed by e-mail and posted on an employee-accessible intranet site. This has resulted in an unnecessary volume of news clips that is not user friendly to recipients, which is often delivered too late and misses critical coverage. 

Bulletin News is the only firm with the unique capabilities to provide the Federal news monitoring service requirements that must begin immediately.  

Reporting Requirements and Deliverable Items

The Contractor shall: 
--Provide media monitoring services to deliver succinct, categorized, in-depth daily news analysis of FDA-relevant media coverage from newspapers, magazines, public health peer-reviewed journals, national and local television, trade press outlets (to the extent possible) and blogs to leadership and staff of FDA. 

--Provide one daily briefing to the FDA by 6 a.m. each business day. The briefing will include a Leading the News section, a Medical Product Safety section, a Food Safety section and a Tobacco section. Weekend and holiday news coverage will be provided in the next business days briefings. The briefings will be delivered by e-mail as well as posted to an employee-accessible only Web site. The Web site must contain archives of past daily briefings for the length of the contract. 
  
Government Furnished Information:
The FDA will provide the contractor with a list of media outlets to monitor. The FDA may routinely ask the contractor to search for specific stories after the agency makes an announcement; the FDA will provide the contractor with specific search terms.  

Bulletin News is uniquely qualified to start the requirements quickly and without any break in service for the period of performance.  Bulletin News has been the contractor for the media monitoring services and analysis services to HHS since 2008. 
 
Interested concerns may identify their interest and submit a capability statement that demonstrates their ability to provide the services required in the timeframe required.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE; THEREFORE, REQUEST FOR SUCH DOCUMENT WILL BE CONSIDERED INVALID RESPONSES.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days from the date of this synopsis, the Contracting Officer will proceed with the contract modification.

The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements. <br /><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>

OTHER APPLICABLE SOLICITATION PROVISIONS

52.209.5      CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS   (APR 2010)
(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that- 
(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals- 
(A) Are o are not o presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
(B) Have o have not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); 
(C) Are o are not o presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; 
(D) Have o, have not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. 
(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(2) Examples. 
(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(ii) The Offeror has o has not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. 
(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). 
This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. 
(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. 
(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. 
(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. 
(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

<DESC>Please reference solicitation#JS1072756 which was a sources sought.<br /><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 05-38.
<p>This announcement constitutes the only full and open competition solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued. This synopsis, NAICS code 334516, is to notify contractors that the government intends to issue a Firm Fixed Price Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.106 for the following statement of work, under the simplified acquisition procedures. Any firm that believes it is capable of providing the required service as stated herein may submit a capability statement to document its ability to provide the required services. A determination to compete this procurement based on a response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial offer(s) is/are providing the Best Value and discussions are not necessary.</p>
<p>Award will be made to the party whose quote offers the best value to the Government. The Government may award this contract to other than the lowest price technically acceptable quote. Technical capability and past performance are significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).</p>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a purchase order for a Thermogravimetric Analyzer (TGA).</p>
<p>Brand Name or Equal to TA Instruments Part#957000.901 Q5000 IR. An "Equal" Instrument shall meet the following specifications.</p>
<p>Temperature Range: The TGA instrument should allow for a measurable temperature range of ambient to 1200&deg;C.</p>
<p>Heating Rate Range: As this instrument will be used for kinetics analyses, a wide range of achievable heating rates is critical. The instrument should be able to control heating rates between 0.1 and 500 &deg;C/min with noise levels over 10&deg;C no greater than &plusmn;0.01&deg;C/min (unsmoothed).</p>
<p>Balance Sensitivity: The TGA balance should have a sensitivity of at least 0.1 &#61549;g and a baseline drift of &lt; 10 &#61549;g over the temperature range ambient &rarr; 1000&deg;C (uncorrected) in either air or N2 atmosphere. The TGA isothermal baseline drift should not be more than 5 &#61549;g over 18 hours.</p>
<p>Cooling Time: Since the machine will be used extensively, it is important that the furnace cooling time be less than 10 minutes from 1000oC to 50oC.</p>
<p>Purge Gas Control: The TGA should include digital mass flow controllers for at least two separate purge gases, such that the purge gas can be automatically switched via software during the experiment. The purge gases must flow horizontally to minimize buoyancy effects. The flow rate must also be adjustable via software during an experiment and the data logged into the resulting data file.</p>
<p>Robotic Auto-sampler/Pan Punching: Because this instrument will be used extensively, and often on a 24 hour basis, it must come equipped with a robotic auto-sampler containing at least 20 sample positions with ability to use pans up to 250&#61549;L pan volume. The instrument must also be capable of performing a unique experiment on each sample within one loaded sample tray. The auto-sampler must also include a contamination free pan punching mechanism, by which samples can be kept sealed in a hermetic environment, and punched open just prior to loading. Ideally, this pan punching will produce a large breach in the pan, rather than a pin-hole, as our materials rely on efficient sample/gas interaction. The system must also have the capability of rejecting any pan that is not pierced. This is to prevent a sealed pan being loaded into the TGA furnace</p>
<p>Variable Rate Control: The TGA instrument should include some form of automatic variable rate control to improve resolution. Ideally, the heating rate will be continuously adjusted as a function of sample mass loss rate, as opposed to a "stepwise isothermal" approach.</p>
<p>High Resolution TGA: The instrument must be capable of automatically and continuously change heating rate as a function of sample weight change. This feature adjusts the temperature increase to lower heating rate as weight loss increases allowing for accurate identification of the exact temperature at which a peak occurs.</p>
<p>Temperature Modulated TGA: The instrument must be capable of performing Temperature Modulated TGA experiments over the entire temperature operating range using a regular, periodic function of known amplitude and frequency to ensure steady state control during the experiment, as well as experimental reproducibility.</p>
<p>Software: As this TGA will be used by numerous researchers, the analysis program should be un-keyed, and should include a site license such that it may be installed (if-needed) on an unlimited number of computers within the FDA. The data analysis program should also include a .pdf generator, for the efficient export of analyzed plots.</p>
<p>The TGA must also include operating software which allows for the instrument to be fully calibrated and verified automatically, without the need for operator presence. Calibrations must include weight and temperature (Curie point). Scheduling capabilities must be present, such that these calibrations and/or verifications can be programmed to perform during normal quiescent periods, such as overnight or on weekends.</p>
<p>In addition, the instrument software must be capable of performing a series of auto-diagnostic tests, either manually or through the scheduling component. These tests should verify the performance of various instrument components such as auto-sampler motors, electronic boards, mass flow controllers, etc. The results of these tests should be logged and the log file accessible to the operator. The instrument should allow for automatic, unattended calibration of both temperature (curie-point standards) and mass. These calibrations should be programmable and schedulable from within the operating software.</p>
<p>CLIN0001: TGA Quantity: 1 Brand Name/Equal to TA Part#957000.901.</p>
<p>CLIN0002: Aluminum Sealed Pan Kit Quantity: 1 Brand Name/Equal to TA Part#957352.901. Contains 100 aluminum pans; 100 aluminum lids, 30 SS bails; punch alighment tool, crimping die and crimping tool.</p>

GOVPAY
GOVPAY ELECTRONIC INVOICINGAll payment requests must be submitted electronically through GovPay.  "Payment request" means any request for contract financing payment or invoice payment by a contractor. To constitute a proper invoice, the GovPay payment request must conform to the requirements identified in FAR 32.905(b), "Payment Documentation and Process" and FAR 52.232-25, "Prompt Payment (OCT 2008)". To ensure the timely processing of invoices GovPay uses an automated "workflow" process to route invoices for review, approvals and payment; as required by the "Prompt Payment Act". Detailed GovPay information for use of GovPay may be obtained on the Internet at www.govpay.gov.  This web site includes user manuals, training resources, instructions for registration and contact information for the GovPay help desk for additional support.  All users can access reports on the status of their invoices. Supporting documentation shall be attached to the GovPay invoice in the form of "flat files" in American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) and an Adobe PDF file.  There is a 15MB limitation on file size for these attachments, per header or line item.  Facsimile, e-mail, and scanned documents are NOT acceptable electronic forms for payment requests.   GovPay uses the contractor information in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database as one of the components for validating contractor registration.  It is the responsibility of the contractor to submit accurate and current CCR information.  Failure to register and maintain CCR information, or if it has expired, been suspended, been deleted, or could not be found, will result in rejection of your invoice.  An invoice submitted during the period for which information in the CCR could not be verified must be resubmitted for payment after successfully registering or updating registration in CCR.  Contractors are encouraged to review their CCR information to ensure the most current information is available for GovPay. The CCR Assistance Center is available to provide assistance and answer questions.  They can be reached at 1-888-227-2423 or on the web at http://www.ccr.gov. [End of clause]

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL<br />ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION<br />FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION<br />INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE<br />ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN<br />SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. THE SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES.
<p>This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-38.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees, however, all interested parties may submit a quotation.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for a Low Background Gamma Detector. All equipment must be new. Refurbished and or remanufactured shall not be considered for award.</p>
<p>All interested Contractors shall provide a quote for the following line items:</p>
<p>Line Item 0001: Quantity One (1) each, Low Background Gamma Detector that shall meet or exceed the following minimum specifications:</p>
<p>1. NIST will install the detector in an existing low-background iron shield with inside dimensions 20" x 20" x 24" high and walls 6" thick. Critical dimensions are provided in attachment I. These critical dimensions are intended to ensure that the detector can be fitted into the existing shield. The height A from the bottom of the cryostat assembly to the top of the detector shall be between 10.0 inches and 12.0 inches. The horizontal distance B from the detector centerline to the preamplifier, vacuum flange, or whatever object first exceeds the cryostat rod diameter C shall be at least 16.5 inches.</p>
<p><br />2. The detector shall be made of p-type intrinsic germanium. The detector's relative efficiency shall be 100% or greater and the resolution 1.9 keV fwhm or less, as defined by the IEEE-325 standard. For further reference to the standard, visit webstore.ansi.org.</p>
<p>3. The diameter of the crystal shall be greater than its length;</p>
<p>4. The detector crystal shall be mounted in a low-background J-shaped cryostat attached to a 30-liter Dewar. The cryostat design must be equivalent to an Ortec Cryostat, Model LLB HJ or a Canberra Cryostat, Model ULB 7915-30. In these designs, the vacuum cryostat emerges horizontally from the lower side of the dewar, and after a certain distance, the detector is installed facing upward, thus ensuring that there is no line of sight from the detector to the outside.</p>
<p>All materials inside the shield shall be selected for low gamma-ray background. The detector capsule shall not be removable from the cryostat in the field.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this solicitation, low background means material that has as low a quantity of radioactive material as possible.</p>
<p>5. The preamplifier shall be mounted outside the shield and shall provide two outputs: one for energy and an identical output for timing a future anticoincidence mantle. A sensing circuit shall provide an output signal for high voltage shutdown whenever the detector temperature becomes too high.</p>
<p>6. The 30 Liter Dewar shall be fitted with a pressure filling cap such that excess liquid nitrogen escapes through an overflow tube. A second pressure filling cap shall also be provided.</p>
<p>Line Item 0002: Warranty:<br />The Contractor shall provide, at a minimum, a one year warranty period for the detector. Warranty shall be on-site or return to Contractor's site, at the discretion of the Contractor.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.
<p>This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-41.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a business size standard of 500 employees. This Solicitation is a 100 percent small business set-aside.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) reactor has been in continuous operation since it achieved initial criticality on December 7, 1967. The existing nuclear instrumentation is organized as three (3) overlapping ranges of coverage - the Source Range, the Intermediate Range and the Power Range - with five (5) Compensated Ion Chamber (CIC) neutron detectors covering all of the Intermediate Range and Power Range in five (5) separate nuclear instrument channels. The neutron detectors for each of these channels are suspended in "dry wells" (Attachment 1) in the biological shield that partially shield them from undesired gamma radiation and allow for removal for servicing or replacement, and for vertical positioning adjustments. The detector wells are vertical metal pipes outside the reactor vessel (containing the fuel core, moderator and cooling water). The pipes are set in concrete and lead shielding.</p>
<p>Over time, the wells have developed constrictions that reduce the interior diameter. These diameter changes cause physical drag and binding and now restrict the ability to place existing CIC detectors in their correct positions. During the past 40 years, detectors were normally removed from their wells only for repair or replacement. Now, to monitor future loss of well diameter, it may be necessary to have to pull each detector out annually of which will greatly increase the risk of damage to the detectors and attached cables.</p>
<p>CURRENT OPERATION</p>
<p>Each of the existing CIC Neutron Detector Assemblies (of which are lowered into each detector well) consist of the following components:</p>
<p>1. The CIC neutron detector itself. Westinghouse WL-8074 or equivalent, with three male type HN coaxial connectors on one end. See Attachment 2.</p>
<p>2. Polyethlene insulating spacers separating the detector and cable connectors from the outer can. See Attachment 3.</p>
<p>3. A protective outer can 3.5 inches in diameter and 31 inches long, with a 3/4-inch inside diameter lifting eye attached. The can is made of type 6061-T6 aluminum and the lifting eye is made of type 316 stainless steel. See Attachment 3.</p>
<p>4. Three radiation- and heat-resistant mineral-insulated coaxial extension cables 7 feet long. See Attachment 4. Before use in the reactor, each MI cable is wrapped with fiberglass insulating tape over its entire length.</p>
<p>5. A different insulating spacer (Attachment 5) carrying three female-to-female type HN coaxial cable bulkhead connectors (part UG-1019/U), used for the transition from the mineral-insulated cables to the conventional flexible coaxial signal and power cables installed from the reactor top to the control room. The control room cables are terminated with female type BNC connectors at the reactor top, and adapted to the female type HN connectors with part UG-309/U with short BNC-BNC cables between.</p>
<p>6. A lifting cable of 1/8-inch 7x7 Stainless Steel Aircraft Cable.</p>
<p>While the lifting cable supports the weight of each detector assembly, there is no provision for support of the attached mineral-insulated cables nor for their corresponding conventional coaxial signal and power cables. The unsupported mineral-insulated cables, especially, are prone to mechanical damage and electrical failure upon every insertion, height adjustment and removal.</p>
<p>The CIC neutron detectors currently used are electrically connected to their cylindrical outer metal enclosure. The detector well walls are metal. The detectors generate spurious signals whenever the detector enclosure, or a coaxial cable outer conductor make contact with the well walls. The protective outer can, with the included insulating spacers, electrically insulates the detector itself and protects it from mechanical damage, and provides the lifting point for insertion, positioning and suspension of the detector assembly.</p>
<p>The mineral-insulated cables are far more resistant to the radiation and heat damage that occurs in conventional coaxial cables. In the present installation, three (3) MI cables connect each detector to the cables from the control room, one (1) each for High Voltage into the detector, Compensating Voltage into the detector and the detector current signal into the control room electronics.</p>
<p>Attachment 3 depicts the final neutron detector arrangement, incorporating a final assembly of the separate components: the compensated ion chamber; fiberglass-wrapped mineral-insulated cables; polyethylene insulating spacers; protective housing; and lifting eye. This assembly is roughly 3.5 inches in overall diameter, and, with the MI cables, is approximately ten (10) feet long. The detector and protective housing itself is approximately 32 inches long overall.</p>
<p>The detector wells (Attachments 6 and 7) are all approximately 23 feet deep, and they are closed, when in operation, with a five-foot long steel plug. Two (2) of the wells execute an 11-degree bend 12 feet down from the top of the well. This well design places two (2) more constraints on the assembled neutron detectors: (a) the overall length, including attached mineral-insulated cables, may not exceed ten (10) feet; and (b) the length of the rigid (detector/enclosure) portion may not exceed 48 inches.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.
<p>This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-41.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a business size standard of 500 employees. This Solicitation is a 100 percent small business set-aside.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) reactor has been in continuous operation since it achieved initial criticality on December 7, 1967. The existing nuclear instrumentation is organized as three (3) overlapping ranges of coverage - the Source Range, the Intermediate Range and the Power Range - with five (5) Compensated Ion Chamber (CIC) neutron detectors covering all of the Intermediate Range and Power Range in five (5) separate nuclear instrument channels. The neutron detectors for each of these channels are suspended in "dry wells" (Attachment 1) in the biological shield that partially shield them from undesired gamma radiation and allow for removal for servicing or replacement, and for vertical positioning adjustments. The detector wells are vertical metal pipes outside the reactor vessel (containing the fuel core, moderator and cooling water). The pipes are set in concrete and lead shielding.</p>
<p>Over time, the wells have developed constrictions that reduce the interior diameter. These diameter changes cause physical drag and binding and now restrict the ability to place existing CIC detectors in their correct positions. During the past 40 years, detectors were normally removed from their wells only for repair or replacement. Now, to monitor future loss of well diameter, it may be necessary to have to pull each detector out annually of which will greatly increase the risk of damage to the detectors and attached cables.</p>
<p>CURRENT OPERATION</p>
<p>Each of the existing CIC Neutron Detector Assemblies (of which are lowered into each detector well) consist of the following components:</p>
<p>1. The CIC neutron detector itself. Westinghouse WL-8074 or equivalent, with three male type HN coaxial connectors on one end. See Attachment 2.</p>
<p>2. Polyethlene insulating spacers separating the detector and cable connectors from the outer can. See Attachment 3.</p>
<p>3. A protective outer can 3.5 inches in diameter and 31 inches long, with a 3/4-inch inside diameter lifting eye attached. The can is made of type 6061-T6 aluminum and the lifting eye is made of type 316 stainless steel. See Attachment 3.</p>
<p>4. Three radiation- and heat-resistant mineral-insulated coaxial extension cables 7 feet long. See Attachment 4. Before use in the reactor, each MI cable is wrapped with fiberglass insulating tape over its entire length.</p>
<p>5. A different insulating spacer (Attachment 5) carrying three female-to-female type HN coaxial cable bulkhead connectors (part UG-1019/U), used for the transition from the mineral-insulated cables to the conventional flexible coaxial signal and power cables installed from the reactor top to the control room. The control room cables are terminated with female type BNC connectors at the reactor top, and adapted to the female type HN connectors with part UG-309/U with short BNC-BNC cables between.</p>
<p>6. A lifting cable of 1/8-inch 7x7 Stainless Steel Aircraft Cable.</p>
<p>While the lifting cable supports the weight of each detector assembly, there is no provision for support of the attached mineral-insulated cables nor for their corresponding conventional coaxial signal and power cables. The unsupported mineral-insulated cables, especially, are prone to mechanical damage and electrical failure upon every insertion, height adjustment and removal.</p>
<p>The CIC neutron detectors currently used are electrically connected to their cylindrical outer metal enclosure. The detector well walls are metal. The detectors generate spurious signals whenever the detector enclosure, or a coaxial cable outer conductor make contact with the well walls. The protective outer can, with the included insulating spacers, electrically insulates the detector itself and protects it from mechanical damage, and provides the lifting point for insertion, positioning and suspension of the detector assembly.</p>
<p>The mineral-insulated cables are far more resistant to the radiation and heat damage that occurs in conventional coaxial cables. In the present installation, three (3) MI cables connect each detector to the cables from the control room, one (1) each for High Voltage into the detector, Compensating Voltage into the detector and the detector current signal into the control room electronics.</p>
<p>Attachment 3 depicts the final neutron detector arrangement, incorporating a final assembly of the separate components: the compensated ion chamber; fiberglass-wrapped mineral-insulated cables; polyethylene insulating spacers; protective housing; and lifting eye. This assembly is roughly 3.5 inches in overall diameter, and, with the MI cables, is approximately ten (10) feet long. The detector and protective housing itself is approximately 32 inches long overall.</p>
<p>The detector wells (Attachments 6 and 7) are all approximately 23 feet deep, and they are closed, when in operation, with a five-foot long steel plug. Two (2) of the wells execute an 11-degree bend 12 feet down from the top of the well. This well design places two (2) more constraints on the assembled neutron detectors: (a) the overall length, including attached mineral-insulated cables, may not exceed ten (10) feet; and (b) the length of the rigid (detector/enclosure) portion may not exceed 48 inches.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>NCNR requires seven (7) Compensated Ion Chamber Neutron Detector Assemblies meeting or exceeding the electrical and mechanical performance of the currently-installed detector assemblies.</p>
<p>All interested Contractors shall provide a comprehensive quotation for Line Item 0001, Line Item 0002 and Line Item 0003 of which must be reflective and/or accompanied by technical literature; warranty policy; lead time after receipt of order; quotation expiration date; and FOB Destination.</p>

<CONTACT>Howard R. Souder, Jr., Phone 3018465096, Email souderhr@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>TITLE: Acquisition of Rhesus Macaques for the Vaccine Research Center Influenza studies using ARRA funds
<p>The Subcontractor shall furnish the necessary management oversight, personnel and technical support services required for the acquisition of pre-screened rhesus macaques. The acquisition will be using ARRA (American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009) funding and is subject to ARRA Federal Funding Regulations.</p>
<p>Support is to be provided for the Vaccine Research Center (VRC) Non Human Primate (NHP) Animal Program and Influenza research. Continuous high quality animal care shall be provided as set forth in the applicable animal welfare regulations, standards and guidelines. Animals must be maintained under carefully controlled conditions to minimize research variables and allow the accurate interpretation of laboratory results. Consequently, it is essential that animal colonies be properly maintained to avoid any situation or condition such as undue stress, diseases, animal identification problems, animal escapes, etc., that might adversely affect ongoing research.<br /><br />Specific Requirements</p>
<p>The offeror's budget should provide a detailed breakdown of cost for NHP sample collections for pre-screening, acquisition and transportation of the NHP's to a housing facility (located within the US)</p>
<p>1. Subcontractor should have a large resource of available rhesus macaques in which blood samples can be collected from male and female NHP's. We estimate that at least 200 animals may have to be pre-screened for specific adenoviruses in order to qualify for VRC influenza studies. The following criteria is applicable for every NHP candidate:</p>
<p>a. NHP's should be in excellent health and na&iuml;ve <br />b. Origin of animal must be traceable from birth including USDA form <br />7020 and/or breeders statement, and medical records must be available<br />upon request.<br />c. Animals must have some form of identification (i.e. tattooed)<br />d. NHP's must weigh 3-7kg at the time of shipment</p>
<p>2. Collection amount is not to exceed the guidelines. It is requested that the Subcontractor transfer the samples according to the NIH Division of Occupational Health and Safety "Shipping Biological Materials" guideline. The blood will be shipped to the Vaccine Research Center in Bethesda, MD. The VRC will be responsible for the pre-screening tests.</p>
<p>3. One Hundred (100) pre-screened NHP's will be chosen by the Vaccine Research Center (approx equal male to female ratio based on availability).</p>
<p>4. Purchase &amp; transportation of the animals is requested for One Hundred (100) Non-Human Primates to the NIH Animal Center in Dickerson, MD.</p>
<p>5. Shipments may not be concurrent; it is estimated that there will be at least two shipments with approximately 50 animals each.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Reporting Requirements and Deliverables<br /><br />Medical records for each NHP candidate should be available upon request.</p>
<p>Animal Identification Report should be submitted to the Project Officer &amp; SAIC-F Subcontracts Specialist. This report can be an Excel spreadsheet and should contain the animal identification number, sex, age, weight, and when blood is to be/or was collected and shipped to the Vaccine Research Center.</p>
<p>The Project Officer &amp; SAIC-F Subcontracts Specialist will be informed within three (3) business days of any animals on the list that are considered in poor condition or have been found dead.</p>

SECTION 2: SCOPE OF SERVICES
Vendor will provide material and one or more instructors who are qualified to deliver the module of the "National Park Service (NPS) Fundamentals III:  Retirement Planning for New Employees" course. The Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) Network is the delivery method utilized.  This delivery method is delivered at a broadcast studio via satellite signal to approximately 235 receiving stations across the country. This training provides 1 way video and two way audio which makes it highly interactive allowing students immediate access to their instructor.
This course will be presented at least five times each Fiscal Year, with one offering delivered on each of the five dates.  Course dates will be negotiated once the contract is awarded, but in general will occur once every quarter.  Additional presentations may be scheduled depending upon demand.  All courses are televised from the Fish & Wildlife Service's National Conservation Training Center broadcast studio, Shepherdstown, West Virginia or at the NPS Stephen T. Mather Training Center broadcast studio, Harpers Ferry, West Virginia.
NPS Fundamentals is a five-part course of study that encompasses a broad understanding of the mission and goals of the NPS.  It is designed to create a workforce that is committed to achieving the NPS mission.  Specifically, NPS Fundamentals focuses on the Universal Competencies:  Mission Comprehension, Agency Orientation, Resource Stewardship, NPS Operations, Fundamental Values, Communication Skills, Problem-solving Skills, and Individual Development and Planning.  The Manager for NPS Fundamentals provides program oversight.  This position is duty stationed at the Horace M. Albright Training Center, Grand Canyon, Arizona.
The "Retirement Planning" is part of the "Individual Development and Planning" competency.  This training consists of two modules; both entitled "Retirement Planning".  Module one is already developed and is an on-line module.  Module two, which this scope of work is requesting, is delivered via interactive television using the NPS TEL network.   Prior NPS approval of material will be required by NPS.
Tasks:
1.	Vendor shall provide an electronic participant guide with detailed information and PowerPoint presentation that matches and flows with the participant guide.  Vendor will not have access to course materials currently in use, and so will need to develop all materials from scratch. All such materials will remain the property of the Vendor.  All participant materials and PowerPoints must be approved by the COR before being used in a program.   Each broadcast will be approximately 2 hours per iteration.
2. 	Vendor shall provide studio instructor(s) for the TEL NPS module on Retirement Planning.  Instructor(s) must have professional expertise in and knowledge of the Civil Service (CSRS) and Federal Employee Retirement System (FERS), and all variations thereof (e.g., 6(C) retirement).  Instructor(s) must have professional expertise of financial planning.  Financial planning experts must be thoroughly familiar with investment options available in all Federal retirement systems, trends in the market, and in the national and global economy in general.  
Vendor shall provide at least if not more, information on:a.  early retirement planningb.  FERS eligibility and FERS componentsc.   types of federal retirementd.  military service/military depositse.  annuity calculationsf.  survivor benefitsg.  thrift savings plan (TSP)h.  TSP fund typesi.  managing TSPj.  federal employee's group life insurancek.  health benefitsl.  long-term care insurancem.  flexible spending accountsn.  available resources
3. 	Vendor shall not provide specific investment advice such as "invest in _____" (a specific company name), but will provide general principles of investing with a focus on taking advantage of the investment options of the Federal retirement system.  Instructor(s) must be able to present compelling arguments to new employees regarding the urgency of retirement planning, using specific examples.
4.	Vendor shall schedule additional, pre-course time to meet with the production manager on-site and/or meet with NPS staff as necessary.   At a minimum, the vendor will meet with the production manager before the first course is presented, either on the day of the presentation or on a day mutually agreed upon prior to the course.  The purpose of the meeting will be to review materials and procedures at the facility, and to rehearse the presentation.  Additional meetings and/or phone consultations may be called by the Manager as necessary.
5.	Vendor shall review the online training module at the outset of the contract, and review no less than quarterly to ensure a strong, clear linkage between the online module and the TEL module.  As an outcome of the review, the vendor is expected to provide current and accurate information to ensure that the online and TEL module materials are up-to-date.  Vendor will inform the Manager of changes as they occur in retirement policy or practices and provide supporting materials to consider for inclusion in one or both modules. 
6.	Changes to the content of the presentation should occur only when information becomes outdated.  Vendor is expected to recommend changes to delivery techniques and/or graphics and other materials based on their professional experience.  All changes must be approved in advance by the Manager prior to implementation.
Required Skills and Abilities:Vendor shall provide instructors who are highly effective and have experience in using distance learning techniques, specifically on camera in a television studio environment.    Instructors must not only deliver the material clearly and effectively, but be able to engage participants in discussion.  Vendor must have experience in covering program content.

3.2	 Prospective Offeror's Questions
	Questions concerning this RFP must be received via email to the Contract Specialist at the address above no later than 3:00 PM MDT on  Wednesday, June 9th.  Answers to questions will be provided to all prospective Offerors, giving due regard to the proper protection of proprietary information.  In order to receive responses to questions, Offerors shall cite the section number and paragraph number of the solicitation.  NPS recommends that Offerors ensure that questions are written to enable a clear understanding as to the Offerors issues or concerns with the referenced paragraph.  Statements expressing opinions, sentiments, or conjectures are considered invalid inquires or comments for this purpose and will not receive a response from NPS.  Further, Offerors are reminded that the NPS will not address hypothetical questions aimed toward receiving a potential "evaluation decision" from the NPS. 	 3.3	Proposal Preparation Instructions
The proposal shall clearly demonstrate the Offeror's understanding of the overall and specific requirements of the Scope of Services; convey the Offeror's capabilities for transforming their understanding into accomplishments for performing the RFP.

SECTION 4 - EVALUATION 
3.1 	Basis for Award 
Source Evaluation will be conducted and selection will be made in accordance with the guidelines provided in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Interior Acquisition Regulation (DIAR).  Award will be made to the Offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered.  
3.2 	Evaluation Process
NPS will perform a technical and business evaluation, based on the Offerors' written Past Performance/Experience (Part 1), Technical (Part 2), and Price (Part 3) proposals, to assess the best value to the Government.  The determination of best value will be made by comparing the differences in the value of the Technical and Past Performance factors with the differences in the prices proposed.  In making this comparison, the Government is more concerned with obtaining performance capability superiority rather than the lowest overall price.  However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall price to achieve only slightly superior performance capabilities.  The Government will assess the benefits of superior performance capability versus the added price.  The degree of equality between Offerors' proposals will be measured by the quantity, significance, and applicability of the superior features proposed. 
Price proposals will be evaluated to determine fairness and reasonableness.  The Government will use commercial or market price lists, Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE), or other information available to NPS in assessing the reasonableness of prices proposed.
3.3 	Award on Initial Proposals
The Government may award without discussions; however, the Contracting Officer (CO) reserves the right to hold discussions if necessary.  Accordingly, each initial offer should be submitted on the most favorable price and technical terms that the Offeror can submit to the Government.
3.4	Evaluation Factors
The Government will evaluate each proposal using the following evaluation factors listed in descending order of importance:
A.	Small Business StatusB.	Demonstrated Technical Capability;C.	Past Performance/Experience; andD.	Price
Small Business Status is essentially pass/fail.  Demonstrated Technical Capability is slightly more important than Past Performance/Experience.  When combined Demonstrated Technical/Management Capability and Past Performance/Experience are more important than price.

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The CPB program was designed to (1) improve the capacity of FATA government institutions to govern and manage increased donor resources and (2) to strengthen the capacity of FATA nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to promote good governance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Building the capacity of state institutions is seen as a key element of the overall USG goal of stabilizing the FATA and strengthening the writ of the Government of Pakistan in conflict-afflicted and at-risk territories.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The CPB was designed to support two government bodies in particular: the FATA Secretariat (responsible for overall governance of the tribal areas and for providing services such as health care, education and public works), and the FATA Development Authority (responsible for the region's economic development).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>On the NGO side, the program selected 42 FATA NGOs to support with a combination of equipment, training, and internships.</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Key objectives of the CBP include the following:</span></p>

<DESC>Agricultural Competitiveness and Enterprise Development (ACED)project will provide technical assistance and training to HVA value chain entities, including farmers in the irrigation systems targeted for rehabilitation under the MCC Compact-funded Transition to High Value Agriculture Project (THVA), through a set of integrated and demand-driven activities focusing on 1) developing and expanding market opportunities for the Moldovan HVA sector; 2) upgrading production and the ability of the value chain to meet buyer requirements; 3) providing demand-driven technical assistance to upgrade the HVA value chain; 4) implementing recommendations for an improved enabling environment. In Transnistria, ACED shall assist MSMEs in the HVA and other sectors to grow their businesses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">By fostering linkages to markets for the Moldovan HVA value chain, by fostering the adoption of modern, sustainable agricultural production practices and policies, and by supporting the transition to HVA in areas impacted by the MCC irrigation investments and by facilitating enterprise development in Transnistria, ACED will increase economic development and will increase employment opportunities and incomes in rural areas of Moldova, thereby contributing to poverty reduction.</p>
The first purpose&nbsp; of ACED is to increase incomes and generate jobs in rural Moldova, by addressing the most critical impediments to the development of a competitive High Value Agricultural (HVA) sector, including development of related non-agribusiness enterprises in the value chain. The focus will be on improving the competitiveness of fresh fruit and vegetable value chains by addressing binding constraints in the value chain at the production, marketing, policy and access to credit levels. Complementing the upcoming MCC investment in irrigation system rehabilitation, ACED will provide critical market development and technical assistance support that will be needed by the beneficiaries as they transition to irrigated HVA production.
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 6pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The second purpose of ACED is to help micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) in the Transnistrian region to grow and become more sustainable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This will represent USAID's first substantial enterprise development effort in Transnistria and shall include but is not limited to the HVA sector.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotations: (1) Technical Capability; (2) Price; and (3) Present and Past Performance. <br />(a) Basis for Award. Government evaluation objective is to award to the responsive responsible firm whose quotation is technically acceptable and will provide the best value to the Government. Technical and past performance, when combined, are approximately equal in importance to price. This evaluation process may result in an award to other than the low quotation. <br />1. Technical Capability. The Government shall evaluate the technical quotation on a pass or fail basis as follows: (a) Verifying that all required documentation listed in the Addenda to 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors for Part I technical information has been submitted by each firm. This factor is met when documentation from the firm demostrates either direct experience or ability to obtain personnel with experience in performing the services as outlined in the Performance Work Statement attached hereto. Quotes incomplete shall receive an "unacceptable" rating and shall receive no further consideration for award of the order. <br />2. Price. Quotations rated technically acceptable shall then be ranked by price (See also paragraph (d) below). The prices will be evaluated for realism, and reasonableness. If the lowest price technical acceptable quotation is judged to have a Substantial Confidence performance assessment, that quotation represents the best value for the Government, the evaluation process stops at this point, and award is made.<br />a. Realism: For prices to be realistic, the overall price in an Firm's quotation must: <br />(1) be realistic for the type of work to be performed <br />(2) reflect a clear understanding of the requirements<br />(3) Reflect what it would cost to perform operating with reasonable economy and efficiency.<br />b.

The Government intends to award an order without discussions with respective firms. The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.<br />d. Options. The Government will evaluate quotes for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that a quotation is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />f. A written notice of award or acceptance of a quotation mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time specified in the quotation, shall result in a binding order without further action by either party. Before the firm's specified expiration time, the Government may accept a quotation (or part of a quotation), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. (end of clause) <br />3. Past Performance. The firm's performance will be assessed, specifically the quality and satisfaction rating for relevant contractual commitments on going or completed within the past five (5) years based on replies received from the past performance questionnaires and information obtained or available to this office, other Government offices or other private sources.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:<br />Commandant (CG-9131)<br />1900 Half St., S.W. (JR11-0203)<br />Washington, D.C., 20593<br />Telephone: 202-372-3692<br />Fax: 202-475-3904</p>

<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG85-10-R-P77JJ9 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This Request for Proposals incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-40. This is a small business set-aside procurement. The NAICS is 336611. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Disputes Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that the Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-9131), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurements, 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC 20593, Telephone (202) 372-3692, Fax: (202) 475-3904.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.<span>&nbsp; </span>Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.<span>&nbsp; </span>Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.<span>&nbsp; </span></span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.<span>&nbsp; </span><span>OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; text-transform: uppercase;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">In November 2007, USAID/OTI launched a new program in Pakistan&rsquo;s Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), and after initial success in this area PTI expanded to NWFP (North West Frontier Province) in late 2008.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Government of Pakistan (GOP) is focusing its efforts to bring security and development to the border areas, demonstrating a new commitment to the FATA through the creation of the FATA Secretariat (FS), and more recently the FATA Development Authority (FDA), in order to attract investment to the region.<span>&nbsp; </span>In 2007, the FS produced the FATA Sustainable Development Plan (SDP) through which the GOP intends to bring sustained development to the region.<span>&nbsp; </span>The GOP has pledged a billion dollars to the SDP and is actively soliciting additional funds from donor governments, including the United States. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">The Pakistan Transition Initiative (PTI) program supports the Government of Pakistan&rsquo;s development efforts to better integrate FATA/NWFP into the political and economic mainstream of Pakistan.<span>&nbsp; </span>PTI also supports the Government of Pakistan in identifying community priorities and addressing some of the region&rsquo;s most immediate needs, which requires close coordination with ongoing USAID, State Department, and Department of Defense activities in the region.</span></p>

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p><br />For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>OTI's Field Programs Division (FPD) develops, oversees, and manages OTI country programs and field staff that includes all programming responsibilities and authorities, and start-up and close out of OTI country programs. FPD staff regularly engages with counterparts in USAID Missions overseas, Regional Bureaus, Department of State, and other offices engaged in country development issues. The FPD provides expertise and technical support for country programs and USAID Missions, and represents OTI in intra/inter-agency sector-specific dialog and debate.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>To hire a Chief, Field Programs Division who will develop, oversee, and manage OTI country programs and field staff.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>The Field Programs Division (FPD) provides expertise and technical support to both OTI Washington and to all country programs in the field, spearheading OTI's strategic engagement in intra/inter-agency sector-specific dialog and debate, and enhancing OTI's ability to actively engage in discussions on matters critical to OTI program objectives. OTI currently has four teams as part of its Field Programs Division, including three regional teams and one technical team: Asia and Middle East (AME) regional team, Africa (AFR) regional team, Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) regional team, and the Surge and Technical Assistance Response Team (START) which includes full time USPSC Transition Specialists, Media and Technology Specialists, and OTI's program personnel surge capacity, a group of approximately 25 intermittent USPSCs also known as the program "Bullpen".</p>
<p>The Chief, Field Programs Division's principal responsibility is to lead these four teams (AME, AFR, LAC, and START), supervising the four team leaders, and managing OTI country programs which includes all programming responsibilities and authorities, assessments, start-ups and close outs.</p>

<p>&bull; Represent OTI's Field Programs Division, as necessary, internally and externally on issues pertaining to OTI's programs;</p>
<p>&bull; On occasions, when required by the OTI Director or Deputy Director, serve as a primary point of contact and liaison with U.S. Ambassadors or his/her Representatives (e.g. in the absence of a USAID Mission), other agencies of the U.S. Government, international organizations, host country government officials, and the non-government community both in the U.S. and abroad who may be highly important to OTI's programs and objectives, with the goal of maintaining or developing common understandings among diverse groups regarding the strategic purpose of OTI programs within the context of USG policy;</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to: (1) Add "Specific Focus Areas for 2011":<br /><br />Specific Focus Areas for 2011<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Effects Assessment Methodology:</span></strong> Investigate quantitative analysis techniques that aid operational assessors' ability to link actions to effects to desired objectives. The specific goals of this effort are to 1) Explore and assess the mathematical techniques that can be applied to improve the performance of the weighted-additive model under conditions of missing data. Within the additive model the scores produced are directly influenced by the data consumed. Missing data will produce erroneous scores and provide misleading analyses and 2) Investigate techniques that demonstrate invariance under conditions of missing data and identify their utility in operational effects assessment. There may be instances where the derivation or estimation of missing data may not be feasible or appropriate. In addition, weighted-additive models have no ability to detect conditions where the data is erroneous.<br /><br />White papers for this topic will be due by: 23 Jun 2010. Awards will not exceed 36 months with dollar amounts ranging from $350,000-$400,000.
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">N-Dimensional Effects-Based Assessment Tools:</span></strong> The objective is to provide operational-level assessors the capability to rapidly develop indicators that assess the Measures of Performance (MoPs) and Measures of Effectiveness (MoEs) of a given plan. The indicators must span the spectrum from strategy-to-task planning, the warfighting domains (air, cyber, and space), and support the near-continuous assessment of effects. Specific goals include: (1) The use of case based reasoning with search algorithms and guidance templates to provide an automated means to assist warfighters in selecting suitable indicators, and (2) The use directed graphs to represent the alignment of operational objectives and effects to assess the achievement of the end-states to provide an intuitive user interface for indicator selection/management and visualizing the assessment. The metrics for this program will include the accuracy and completeness of the set of indicators recommended, improvement in the speed of the process (&Delta;t), and overall quality of the resulting operational assessment.<br /><br />White papers for this topic will be due by: 23 June 2010. Awards will not exceed 24 months with dollar amounts ranging from $500,000 - $1,000,000.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">COA Analysis Simulation (CASIM):</span></strong> The objective is to provide the ability to quickly develop simulations to analyze COAs and evaluate capabilities across multiple domains. The goals within this effort are to 1) Integrate disparate models and analysis tools within a federation and 2) Advance and employ an integrated composable modeling and simulation capability to create realistic cyber warfare operational scenarios for course of action (COA) exploration. <br /><br />These goals are to be accomplished while taking into consideration the number of COAs analyzed/day, the breadth of effects considered, model integration and setup time, number of models integrated and entities run.<br /><br />The models and simulations are to be focused on Cyber COA development and decision support tools.<br /><br />White papers for this topic will be due by: 21 Jun 10. Awards will range 12-24 months with dollar amounts ranging from $100,000 - $865,000.<br /><br />All other information remains the same.</p>

As such, no "trade off" applies and the Government intends to award to the low priced firm who is compliant with terms of the solicitation, and deemed "technically acceptable." There will be no re-submittals for PDM and only firms with satisfactory or better PDMs will be eligible for award. Technical Acceptability is being defined herein as satisfactory, very good or exceptional PDMs. All PDMs will be evaluated in accordance with the criteria outlined in the solicitation. From among technically acceptable firms, the Government will then select the lowest price offeror and determine if that firm is responsible, complies with terms and conditions of the solicitation and an award to them is in the best interest of the Government. If that firm fits these criteria, award will be made to them. If not, the Government will review each subsequent technically acceptable low priced offer until one is identified that does meet the criteria, in which case award will be made to that firm. The Government reserves the right to conduct negotiations with a competitive range group of offerors from among technically acceptable firms, based on price. If negotiations are conducted, award will be made to low priced offer (based on final proposal revision closing, date/time) that is technically acceptable, responsible and compliant with solicitation terms and conditions.

OWCP/BMSR intends to certify and contract with individual VRCs in these areas to provide direct vocational rehabilitation services for injured workers covered by the Employees' Compensation Act.  OWCP certification involves (1) minimum qualification criteria, (2) rating of educational and experience factors, (3) selection of those counselors with the highest ratings, (4) required attendance at a two day training workshop, and (5) a contractual agreement to follow OWCP standards.

The minimum qualifications for consideration are:  (1) a bacelor's degree from an accredited four year college or university and (2) two years vocational rehabilitation counseling experience.

Each VRC is required to submit to the OWCP National Office a complete application package, ORIGINAL AND DUPLICATE, consisting of:  (1) a narrative summary which provides a complete and detailed description of their work experience and educational background, including vocational counseling experience in using the labor market, job placement and using testing/vocational evaluation, (2) copies of transcripts supporting the college/university degrees obtained, (3) two letters of reference verifying workers' experience (not character references), and (4) a signed cover letter or statement by VRC indicating that the application package demonstrates the intent to be available to provide direct services to injured workers covered under OWCP, and including the following statement:  "I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, all information, statement and documents herein presented are true, correct, complete and made in good faith, under penalty of disqualification and prosecution under the law."

Applicants with the highest ratings will be selected to attend the required training workshops.  The training workshops are to take place the week of September 13, 2010.  OWCP will provde a memorandum of attendance which the VRC may use to apply for continuing education units.  VRCs are not paid or othewise reimbursed for attending those workshops.

Certification extends for a basic one year period, followed by a minimum of an additional option year.  Evaluaton of counselor's performance will determine whether options are renewed.

VRCs who receive referrals are evaluated on OWCP's standards of timeliness, quality, and adherence to OWCP's policy and procedures.  Additional rating factors are positive outcomes or successful closures.  These evalluations will detemine whether the VRC continues to receive referrals, and have a bearing on egilibility for future workshops.

VRCs selected to provide direct services are compensated at the rate of $75 per hour for professional time, and $37.50 (one half the rate) per hour for non-professional time in WA, OR, and ID and $95 per hour for professional time and $47.50 (one half the rate) per hour for non-professional time in AK, based on the OWCP approved schedule for direct services on a cases by case basis.

<CONTACT>Henry Provencio, 4-FRI Team Lead, Email hprovencio@fs.fed.us - RUFUS KI COLE, Contracting Officer, Email rcole01@fs.fed.us
<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY .  THIS IS NOT A SYNOPSIS FOR A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).
This notice is being used as a mechanism for obtaining industry comments and ideas for the purpose of creating a stewardship contract that will provide the services needed at the lowest possible cost or even negative cost to the Government in regard to the general requirement stated below.   The Government is not obligated to, nor will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this Request for Information. 


ProjectName:  
Four Forest Restoration Initiative (4-FRI) Project 

PROJECT INFORMATION:
The Southwestern Region (AZ and NM) of the Forest Service intends to perform a  large, minimum, multi-year forest restoration project in central Arizona under the authorities of the 16 U.S.C. 2104 Note, Stewardship End Result Contracting Projects Act.  The overall objective is to treat approximately 1 million acres of ponderosa pine forest types by thinning and harvesting mainly small diameter trees in excess of ecological requirements under a number of 10-year stewardship contracts.  This process could take up to 20 to 30 years as contracts are awarded presupposing that the Stewardship Contracting Authority is extended.  This would yield up to 8 to 10 million CCF (100 cubic feet) of wood fiber.  The rate of treatments under the first contract is anticipated to be a minimum of 30,000 acres per year over a ten-year contract period.  It is expected that most treatment areas would accommodate ground-based harvest systems with some temporary road construction requirements and minor amounts of specified road reconstruction.  Areas proposed for treatment are scattered across four forests  Tonto, Kaibab, Coconino, and Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests.  

The purpose of this request is to begin to identify issues specific to an RFP with regards to the needs of the forest industry.  For example: 
1.	How would you structure existing industries to efficiently harvest and utilize the full spectrum of available raw material which includes biomass, roundwood, and sawlogs.
2.	How would you propose to structure partnerships with other businesses that would enable costs for treatment to be at or near zero?
3.	How long would your plant take to construct and how long after award would you anticipate the plant starting production?  
4.	After start up, assuming there is a gradual increase to full production, how long do you anticipate that you would need to be at full production? 
5.	How long after contract award would you need to start harvest and removal of logs or other forest residue?
6.	How much wood would you project for the first year after award, what amount in year two, etc?  
7.	What amount of wood do you project needing at full production?  
8.	Would you prefer the contract be with your company, and you would subcontract to the logging companies; or would you prefer a logging contractor be the primary contractor with a separate contract with your company?


There is no formal contract at present, the exact acres to be treated have not all been identified, and the exact amount of wood to be removed has not been determined to any degree of precision.  However, a supply assessment has determined that there is a large sustainable supply for up to 20 years projected, and the Forest Service is confident that the volumes will be substantial and firm.  From this information it is projected that there will be more contracts of comparable size in the future.  

THE REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL PROCESS:

Now is the time to provide us with any critical comments or ideas related to this project.  If there is something that we need to consider in developing the RFP, which will help make this project a success for all of us, whether it has been specifically asked or not, please let us know.  Once we begin putting the RFP together, we must maintain a considerable degree of confidentiality.  

We plan to solicit proposals late in calendar year 2010 or early 2011 and award in early to mid calendar year 2012.     
Submission Requirements:  
So that we may better determine capabilities and requirements for this prospective procurement, we request that you submit  your answers to the questions above and any additional comments or concerns you may have by 3:00 pm Mountain Time on July 30, 2010, with the title of the project (Four Forest Restoration Initiative Stewardship Project or 4-FRI) in the subject line. Please be advised that all public information available about this requirement is provided in this notice. The preferred method of communication is by email.  Due to volume of contacts, phone calls will not be returned.  Please send your responses to Henry Provencio, 4-FRI Team Leader at hprovencio@fs.fed.us and Rufus KI Cole, Contracting Officer at rcole01@fs.fed.us.

<DESC>The Forest Service is requesting proposals for replacement and upgrade on Republic Ranger District Office, building # 2019, remove and replace existing composition roofing 
(approx. 7150 SF) and sheathing.  The building is 5 years old and exhibiting moisture related failures of the roof system.  Excessive moisture intrusion combined with insufficient attic ventilation appears to be the cause of the roof system issues.   The current roof system has wings with gable ends and the main part of the building is vaulted roof system.  Work includes furring up the roof, re-sheathing with plywood, enhancing ventilation; re-flashing roof, installing baffled ridge vents, replacing fascia, reroofing with standing seam metal roof and humidistat controlled fans in gable end walls. There also will be a bid alternate for reroofing with composition roofing. Contract performance time is 60 days.  Work will need to be done in phases so building is not exposed to the elements.  The job site is located on the Republic Ranger District compound in Republic, Washington, Ferry County.  Solicitations will be available on or about May 25, 2010.  Engineering point of contact is Lou Janke, Facilities Engineer, Colville National Forest, telephone:  (509) 684-7230.  A site visit is tentatively set for June 8, 2010 at 10 am meeting at the Republic Ranger District Office.   Estimated project value $25,000 to $100,000 NAICS 238160 with size $14.0 mil.

<DESC><p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY - Solicitations are not available at this time. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. This notice does not constitute a commitment by the United States Government.</p>
<p>The Eastern Acquisition Division (EAD) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Norfolk, VA is exploring sources, on behalf of the Protected Resources Division of the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) for a priority research project relative to Atlantic Sturgeon in the James River. <br />The primary objectives of this study are to gather data on the migration patterns and habitat utilization of Atlantic sturgeon in the James River. A temporal and spatial description of sturgeon movement and habitat occupation is needed. It is necessary for this information to be presented in Geospatial (GIS) analysis to determine life stage specific trends. Also, tracks will need to be integrated into high-resolution benthic maps to further resolve habitat use where possible. A secondary objective focuses on identifying potential spawning habitat by overlaying adult tracks in the spring and fall with the benthic maps of the James River. Another objective of this study would be to continue population monitoring. This would include the continuation of a relative abundance survey in the James so that population abundance trends can be accurately determined. Data to support the description of critical population parameters, including abundance, age, size structure, and growth will be collected including tissue samples for genetics. Mark and recapture efforts in the James will be continued and the information presented in any interim and final reports to NMFS. If additional funding is available to continue this work over the course of four option years, this will allow for a very robust population monitoring program that will provide needed data to develop a population estimate for the James River subpopulation which is critical to recovery efforts. Tasks to be completed include the following: 1) Continue to deploy the sonic array consisting of 40-45 receivers in this area and maintain it for at least one additional year. This array will stretch from the lower James River near river mile 28 (Burwell Bay) to river mile 75 (Rockets deep water terminal), and it will provide 24 hour remote tracking year round. 2) Some gill net sampling will be conducted to continue population monitoring efforts in order to gather information necessary for developing a robust population estimate for the James River subpopulation. From this sampling effort, at least five additional sturgeon will be implanted with transmitters (using VEMCO V16 transmitters or a similar type), tracked using the VEMCO array (existing and augmented by 2 new VR2W wireless passive receivers), and released. 3) Subsequent tracks from the over sixty fish that are carrying transmitters will be examined by life stage (adults&gt;1550mmTL, sub adults&lt;1150 and YOY&lt;550mm) for habitat use patterns to identify temporal and spatial migration trends and patterns in habitat occupation. This information will be displayed in GIS maps. 4) Adult tracks in the spring will be cross referenced with benthic habitat maps to determine potential spawning habitats and this information shared with other partners who are leading spawning habitat restoration efforts. 5) Habitat use patterns will be examined by life stage (adult/sub-adult) and river mile to determine guidelines for time/area regulations and improved area based abundance models. This information will be displayed in GIS maps. 6) Migration patterns will be examined for temporal and spatial trends as well as relationships with physical parameters such as temperature, moon cycle and potentially tide levels. This information will be displayed in GIS maps.</p>
<p>The DOC/NOAA is seeking the following information:</p>

<DESC>Architectural/Engineering (A/E) Design Services
For New U.S. Embassy Annex Office Building (NOX), Moscow, Russia
RFP#SAQMMA10R0270
Amendment 1

The U.S. Department of State (DOS), Office of Logistics Management, on behalf of the Office of Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO), is seeking a qualified A/E firm, joint venture or other such entity, to provide comprehensive A/E design services for a new U.S. Embassy Annex Office Building (NOX) in Moscow, Russia.  A Secret facility security clearance (FCL) and a Secret personnel security clearance (PCL) will be required as specified below.  This will be a design-bid-build project.

Description of Project:  The NOX will be approximately 15,000 GSM in area and will include office space for approximately 300 personnel, apartments, and a parking structure.   Construction of the annex will require the demolition of existing townhouses and other embassy facilities.  Dislocated General Services Offices (GSO) will be reconstructed in the basement of the annex along with the utilities and other functions disturbed during the construction of the annex. 

The estimated construction cost is in excess of $100 million.  The estimated award date of the A/E contract is September 2010 with design duration of approximately 14-16 months.  Award of the construction contract is planned for FY-2012.  The A/E contract will be fixed price, with a fixed construction budget.

The A/E services under this contract will include work by the following architectural/engineering disciplines: planning; architectural (including landscape); civil; geotechnical; structural (including blast); seismic; mechanical; electrical; fire protection; and LEED.  Expertise is required in: information systems; telecommunications; physical and technical security; environmental security engineering (chem.-bio); sustainable design; energy conservation; pollution prevention and the use of recovered materials; space planning and systems furniture integration; interior design; design for customer and queue management; food service planning; vertical transportation; lighting design; site design; reliability centered maintenance; design and construction scheduling; cost estimating, and value engineering.

The A/E may be required to have an approved local design consultant; however, identifying this expertise at this time is not required.  Further information on this requirement will be provided to the selected A/E firm when the Request for Proposal (RFP) is issued.  U.S. Codes and USG requirements and the International Building Codes (IBC) will apply.  The site, buildings and related facilities will be designed in hard metric (system International) units.  Construction documents shall be submitted with AutoCAD Release 14 or higher.  The selected A/E will be required to use OBOs ProjNet for the electronic transmission of Sensitive But Unclassified USG information.

A/E firms will be point-scored for purpose of establishing a short list for consideration by the OBO Architectural Engineering Council (AEC).  The AEC, at its discretion, may request additional information from the short-listed firms, but will then hold discussions or request presentations by a final short-list of A/E firms as prescribed by the Brooks Act and FAR 36.602-3.  The AEC will not re-score the participating A/E firms, but will make its own determination of the best qualified consistent with the announced evaluation criteria and will recommend that firm for award to the OBO Director.

Security Investigative Requirements:  

In order to be eligible to perform under this contract, the successful A/E firm must possess or be able to obtain a Department of Defense (DoD) SECRET facility security clearance (FCL) issued under the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), DoD 5220.22-M.   Specifically, designated personnel assigned to this contract must also possess a final SECRET personnel security clearance (PCL) issued by the USG.  Subcontractors working on this contract must also possess a final Secret FCL and personnel must have a final Secret PCL.  All offerors will be required to comply with the security requirements outlined in the NISPOM and supplemental security procedures provided by the client.

 Sponsorship of a firm for an FCL does not guarantee that a firm will meet the requirements for the clearance.  A period of 90 calendar days will be allowed for an A/E firm to obtain the required Secret clearance.  If a sponsored firm does not obtain a Secret FCL prior to being asked to develop a detailed price and technical proposal in response to a Request for Proposal (RFP) to design the Moscow NOX, the Department of State will not be obligated to delay the release of the RFP and may request a proposal from the next ranked firm that does have the appropriate facility clearance.  Other than sponsorship of the firm, the Department of State assumes no responsibility for the clearance process.  Firms, which form joint ventures, must also comply with the above FCL and PCL requirements.  A/E firms that currently hold the required security clearances are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code, if applicable, with their submissions.

Description

The USPS is considering potential sources to upgrade many of the existing fleet of Small Parcel Bundle Sorter (SPBS) machines.  This upgrade will be performed by providing each location with a kit of SPBS upgrade parts which will be installed at each site.  The upgraded SPBS will be called the Automated Parcel Bundle Sorter (APBS).  The APBS parts will be integrated into the APBS "Build Kit.  This FebizOpps announcement is for the sourcing, purchase, aggregation, and shipping of an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system to support parcel and bundle sorting automation equipment.  It is anticipated that each APBS OCR System Kit will be customized per USPS needs and will be packaged and shipped within the United States.

Background

The USPS is increasing productivity of its package processing operations by deploying automated package and bundle sortation equipment.  A central focus of this effort is OCR and bar code recognition (BCR) platforms.  APBS is designed to perform address recognition, barcode visibility, and revenue protection functions on packages and bundles.  

The objective of this notice is to gather information from current sources that can meet the requirements specified herein.  This is a request for information only and is not a solicitation to purchase equipment or services.  The USPS may use information gathered through this announcement to pre-qualify multiple sources for the opportunity to submit a proposals for possible future solicitations.

Pre-qualification Process

Pre-qualification is a process whereby a suppliers ability to meet specific USPS requirements is evaluated.  A purchase team will review and evaluate documentation submitted by interested suppliers in accordance with the evaluation factors listed in this announcement.  To receive credit for evaluation purposes, suppliers must meet all the requirements and submit adequate documentation.  Failure to address an item or submit the required documentation will reflect negatively in the evaluation scoring.

After the purchase team review and analyze supplier responses based on information requested in this pre-qualification process, suppliers may be placed on the pre-qualified list.  All qualified suppliers may not be placed on the pre-qualified list if the purchase team decides (1) a smaller group will provide adequate competition, or (2) that some suppliers are considerably more qualified than others, thereby precluding opportunities for the less qualified.

During this process, each prospective supplier can be assured of the following:
1.	All suppliers will be treated fairly and objectively
2.	The inclusion or exclusion of a particular supplier will be based on business decisions alone and will be judged solely on the predetermined pre-qualification criteria.
3.	A sufficient number of suppliers will be placed on the list to ensure adequate completion for subsequent purchases.
4.	Any sensitive business information provided by a supplier will be sufficiently protected from disclosure.

The pre-qualification process does not constitute an assurance that a subsequent Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued.  However, when, or if a RFP is issued, it will be provided to those suppliers on the pre-qualification list. Those pre-qualified suppliers will be required to agree to a Non Disclosure Agreement prior to receipt of the potential USPS RFP.  Should an RFP be issued, it may or may not result in an award, and the Postal Service reserves the right to make more than one award to procure the services required.  The USPS may elect to use the information received in the responses to this pre-qualification process to satisfy subsequent business needs. 

Late Submissions

Any document received at the office designated in the pre-qualification package after the exact time specified for receipt will not be considered unless it is received before the evaluation takes place, and:
a.	It is the only submission received; or
b.	Consideration of the submission is determined by the contracting officer to be in the Postal Services interest.

Requirements

Potential sources must have the ability to provide an address recognition platform utilizing OCR and BCR capabilities in a real-time environment.  This recognition platform must accept binarized images from an industrial camera application and output finalized address information based on an address directory database.  This platform must be capable of integration with third party camera systems and arbitration systems using either open interfaces or USPS-proprietary interfaces.  An estimated 200 mail processing machines will require local integration of this platform.  

The Supplier must show the ability to obtain, provide, and support this image recognition platform.  The ability to provide technical support after deployment must be demonstrated by the Supplier.  

The platform must be capable of meeting minimum performance requirements, including minimum recognition required accept rate of approximately 80% of non-barcoded mail and error rate of 1.0 % or less of accepts within a time limitation of less than 1,000ms from image acquisition.


Schedule & Deliverables

The pre-qualification process is not a solicitation.  Pricing is not an evaluation factor in the pre-qualification process so therefore business packages must not include any pricing information.  To receive credit for evaluation purposes, suppliers must meet all criteria and submit all adequate documentation.  Supplier must address each of the requirements listed under Evaluation Criteria independently and in-depth.  Statements to criteria such as will comply, the equipment complies, or the like, will reflect negatively in the evaluation scoring.

For standardization, please address and tab each individual criterion separately by the number listed under Evaluation Criteria.   Section headings must match the evaluation criteria.  Please clearly mark each sheet containing confidential and proprietary information.

Pre-qualification submission is limited to 10 pages (8.5 x11- single sided, minimum 10 point font).  This does not include the table of contents page, past performance references, financial information or screen print items (limit screen print items to 2 pages per criterion).  

Interested parties shall submit a total of six (6) hard and six (6) soft data copies of their response to Mr. Darryl L. Mattocks on or before 11:00 AM EST, Monday Jun  21, 2010.  

Questions regarding pre-qualifications should be directed to Darryl Mattocks, (703) 280-7431, darryl.l.mattocks@usps.gov.

<DESC>Question and Answer regarding this Special Notice posting: Vendors are requested to hold all questions until the combined synopsis/solicitation is issued.
<p><strong>**Additional questions received in response to this Special Notice will not be answered.**</strong></p>
<p>Q: Is this project considered a new requirement?<br /><br />A: There currently no contract in place for combatives instruction services. NSWCEN has purchased services for combatives instruction in the past, so the type of instruction is not a new requirement in that sense. The combined synopsis/solicitation that is pending will have revised requirements from any previous contract.<br /><br />NSWCEN had posted two solicitations with the intent to contract for combatives services; however both solicitations had to be cancelled due to considerable changes in the requirements of the Government that rendered these two solicitations invalid. Solicitation H92240-09-R-GN47 was cancelled in its entirety in AUG 2009. Solicitation H92240-10-R-0008 is pending official cancellation; notice will be posted by the Government regarding this cancellation.<br /><br />In both of these cancelled solicitations the Government identified the incumbent as Dieter's Close Quarters Defense, Inc.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. No reimbursement will be made for any cost associated with providing information in response to this notice. This is a market research tool being used to determine the availability and adequacy of potential small business sources prior to determining the method of acquisition.   The Washington Headquarters Services, Acquisition &amp; Procurement Office is seeking interested small business concerns that are capable of providing personnel, equipment, tools, materials, and supervision necessary to perform maintenance to the existing DoD facility budget models; publish the next annual version of the models; and assist Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) with discovering potential upgrades that would increase model accuracy and better predict budget requirements.  This contract would be structured with model maintenance and production of an updated annual version release as the basic deliverable. All other tasks such as major model updates that require further study, analysis, and testing; real property portfolio management support; and training are separate contract option items which may be exercised by the Government as needed.    We are seeking information regarding the availability of Small Business, 8(a), Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, or Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Small Business concerns, qualified under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541511, with a size standard of $25.0 million.  After review of the responses submitted, a solicitation announcement will be published in the Federal Business Opportunities website if the Government intends to continue with the procurement. The proposed work will consist of a base contract period of one (1) year with four (4), one-year option periods. Responses should include the following information: company name, address, point of contact, phone number, email address, and business type (SDB, 8a, etc.). Responses are due no later than 10:00 a.m. EST, 26 May 2010. Responses should be emailed to: robin.castoldi@whs.mil.   This market survey is for informational and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bid or proposals, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for or award a competitive contract. The Government will not provide a "debrief" on the results of the survey. All information submitted will be held in a confidential manner and will only be used for the purpose intended. Points of contact listed may be contacted for purpose of verifying performance.

<DESC>&nbsp;
<p>RECOVERY-PER FAR 5.7 THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY; THEREFORE FAR 5.203 DOES NOT APPLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONL Y TO THE 8a CONTRACTOR UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER: FA8501-09-C-0057, PORTER SCIENTIFIC, INC. (DBA: PORTER ENVIRONMENTAL) <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Demolish tank 96 and build a new 500,000 gallon fire suppression water tank (Project UHHZ 060328A).&nbsp; The 78th Contracting Squadron, Robins AFB, GA has issued this modification of an 8(a) Sole Source Firm-Fixed Price contract to Porter Scientific (DBA: PORTER ENVIRONMENTAL), 719 OLD MAIN RD, Pembroke NC, 28372-8753, Cage Code: 1SLR1, DUNS: 030458991.&nbsp;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This acquisition is subject to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 237110.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This project consists of, but is not limited to, furnishing all necessary engineering, labor, tools, supervision, materials, licenses, permits, insurance, transportation, and equipment to replace tank # 96 (a 500,000 gallon fire suppression tank).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The project modification required an engineering plan to build the new tanks in the same location as the existing tank so that temporary tanks are required during construction which is a change from the original award when the new tank was engineered to be built next to the existing tank 96.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The temporary tanks must provide for the flow of water to the 4 existing 3,500 gallon per minute pumps is not hindered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The tank will be built on a concrete foundation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The tank will have anti-corrosion coatings for long life and durability.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Magnitude of this project is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.00.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This range does not necessarily reflect the proximity of the actual estimated cost.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Government anticipates construction to begin in June 2010.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Any questions in regards to this notice must be submitted in writing or via email to Peter Wynkoop at <a href="mailto:peter.wynkoop@robins.af.mil">peter.wynkoop@robins.af.mil</a>.</p>
<p>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because A statute exists that expressly authorizes or requires that the acquisition be made from a specific source or through another agency (FAR 6.302-5); specifically, <em>FAR 6.302-5(b)(4) Sole source awards under the 8(a) Program -- 15 U.S.C. 637 (see <a href="http://farsite.hill.af.mil/reghtml/regs/far2afmcfars/fardfars/far/19.htm#P688_162484" target="_blank">Subpart 19.8</a>).</em><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"> </span><em>Per FAR 6.302-5 a J&amp;A is not required for this award.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[The title for this project at <a href="http://www.recovery.gov/">http://www.recovery.gov</a> originally read: Mnt/Coat Non-Portable Water Tank, Fr Protec Wtr Stor, #96.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The government has chosen to replace these tanks rather than metalizing them based on a cost-benefit analysis.]</p>
<p>This work was previously offered to Porter Scientific Inc. by the government at Robins AFB, GA, but funding&nbsp;was unavailable for the project award prior to the Stimulus funds being made available by the congress.&nbsp;&nbsp;By statute&nbsp;the 8(a) program&nbsp;is a sole source program under $3,500,000.00; hence, the government is still offering this work to Porter Scientific under the 8(a) program as a sole source firm fixed price acquisition in accordance with FAR 6.302-5(b)(4).</p>

For this action, the successful offeror bid $5,720.00 for the base year. When the option years were added into the total price, the potential price of the contract, assuming all option years are exercised by the government is $30,524.00.

<DESC>RECOVERY - PER FAR 5.7 THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY; THEREFORE FAR 5.203 DOES NOT APPLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): R&D Maintenance Services, Inc., W91278-08-C-0013<br><br>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>Furthermore, the existing contract must be used because the contractor is responsible for the complete inspection, maintenance, and repair of all project buildings and structures, as well as all equipment and vehicles to support the effort. The contractor has not only the management, technical, and administrative skills to efficiently and effectively accomplish this work at a reasonable cost, but also, the advantage of the flexibility to readily adjust to any unforeseen obstacles encountered during installation.  <BR> <BR>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using funds appropriated by the Act.  Acquisitions must comply with FAR, and to the maximum extent practicable, be awarded under competitive procedures as fixed-price (FP) contracts.  The Mobile District intends to use the current CPAF contract to meet it requirements.  Though not a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside.  The contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  Furthermore, the existing Operation and Maintenance contractor has experienced personnel that are already on site and ready to perform the work.  Accordingly, it is deemed to be in the best interest of the government and in compliance with the goals of the Recovery Act to use the existing Operation and Maintenance contract to accomplish the requirements listed above. <BR><BR>
