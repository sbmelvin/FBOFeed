<DESC><p>DARPA's MOSAIC program aims to overcome the limits of conventional imaging system design strategies and to demonstrate the feasibility of innovative design approaches providing for near-linear growth of optical information throughput with increasing imaging system scale. This will enable extraordinarily high imaging performance in reasonably small and affordable form factors. The specific MOSAIC challenge problem is to design and demonstrate an imaging system that achieves very high angular resolution over a wide field of view without paying the heavy penalties in size, weight, and temporal complexity or SNR degradation incurred by today's approaches. <br />DARPA is particularly interested in integrated system approaches that exploit the co-design of optics, sensors, and processing to manage the transduction and management of enormous quantities of data from photons to information within compact, power efficient, and affordable form factor.  All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a proposal to this BAA, should be directed to the administrative addresses below; e-mail or fax is preferred.<br />The administrative addresses for this BAA are: <br />Electronic Mail: DARPA-BAA-09-50@darpa.mil <br />(Addressed to: DARPA/MTO, DARPA-BAA-09-50)</p>

<a href="mailto:brian.johnson@va.gov">Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, CAI, Frederick, MD, intends to negotiate a sole source procurement with Advanced Sterilization Products c/o Johnson and Johnson Health Care Systems, Inc., 425 Hoes Lane, Piscataway, NJ 08855 on behalf of USAF, 79 Medical Logistics, 1057 West Perimeter Rd, Andrews AFB, MD 20762. This proposed contract action is for an EvoTech Endoscope Cleaner and Reprocessor (ECR) System and all accompanying parts and supplies. The VA intends to procure this requirement on a sole source basis in accordance with the statutory authority of section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 as implemented by FAR 12.501(a). Only one responsible source for this commercial item and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES and no solicitation will be issued; however, any firm that believes it can meet the requirements may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 8 days from the date of the publication of this synopsis. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirement listed. Responses are due by May 4, 2009 at 4:30pm EST. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. If no responses are received, the Department of Veteran Affairs will proceed with a sole source negotiation with Advanced Sterilization Products. The justification for the brand name requirement is as follows:a.	This ECR is the only system with FDA clearance to automate manual cleaning. The Evo Tech System's 33-minute cycle time includes the normally labor-intensive manual cleaning of the scope, which takes 6-10 minutes per scope. Additionally, this system automatically detects leaks thereby eliminating the inconsistencies associated with manual inspection. b.	Ensures compliance, consistency, and safety for staff and patients with less handling of endoscopes to reduce the risk of damage.c.	Its enhanced automation helps save time/money, increases productivity and frees staff to focus on patient care.d.	There have been many human errors and inadequate manual cleaning reported in endoscope reprocessing, increasing a patient's/staff's risk/exposure to infection. e.	The Evo Tech ECR System has a large basin size (21 inches) this helps to prevent endoscope coiling, therefore potentially reducing endoscope repair costs. f.	This system has an integrated MEC monitoring which assures precise results by eliminating the use of test strips. The single use of CIDEX OPA Concentrate Solution safely delivers fresh and consistent single metered dose of high-level disinfectant in every cycle.Technical Data of the EvoTech Endoscope Cleaner and Reprocessor System: Where marketed United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and SingaporeFDA Clearance YesConfiguration Floor, Stand-aloneMobility Moveable, 4 casters, 4 levelersStandard of Care High Level disinfectionAir Capability Yes, to all internal channelsSelf-Disinfect Cycle YesOverall SizeHeight (with lid closed) 117 cm (46 in)Height (with lid open) 150 cm (59 in)Width (without printer) 95 cm (37 in)Depth 82 cm (32 in)Weight (when empty) 226.8 kg (500 lbs)Operating Weight Approximately 254 kg (560 lbs)Basin Size 46.4 cm x 50.2 cm x 14.6 cm (18.25 in x 19.75 in x 5.75 in)Service Access Area 36 total inches needed on one side.

<DESC><p>The Office of Justice Programs (OJP), Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) intends to issue a purchase order on a sole source basis to SPSS, Inc., 233 S. Wacker Drive, 11th Floor, Chicago, IL 60606 for the purpose of renewing SPSS software licenses and maintenance. The BJS has standardized the SPSS statistical program to ensure interoperability among statisticians. All BJS statisticians can read and write SPSS syntax, which allows them to work together to create and verify analyses. The SPSS software is OJP/BJS standard and essential to BJS' mission to collect, analyze, publish, and disseminate information on crime, criminal offenders, victims of crime, and the operation of justice systems at all levels of Government. The statistical information obtained, using SPSS software is critical to Federal, State, and local policymakers in combating crime and ensuring that justice is both efficient and evenhanded. BJS statisticians require no training on the SPSS software. All mission-critical data are in the SPSS format and are an essential part of the IT infrastructure that supports the BJS critical mission. It is imperative that there is no disruption to statistical analysis and data publication. These statistics are important to policymakers and others who need to understand and make informed decisions about important criminal and civil justice issues. As the statistical arm of the Department of Justice, (OJP), BJS collects, analyzes, publishes, and disseminates information about crime, criminal offenders, victims of crime, and the operation of justice systems at all levels of government. These data are used by the Nation to establish benchmarks for the criminal justice system, to develop sound policy, and to ensure that the administration of justice is fair and fair-minded. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS. However, all responsible parties who identify their interest and capability to satisfy this requirement will be considered. No solicitation will be issued, therefore, all requests for the solicitation will be considered non-responsive.

<DESC><p>The Office of Justice Programs (OJP), Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA), Public Safety Officers' Benefits (PSOB) Program, intends to issue a purchase order on a sole source basis to the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation (NFFF), 16825 S. Seton Avenue, Emmitsburg, Maryland, 21727-8920. The PSOB program is administered by the BJA and provides death, disability, and education benefits to those individuals that are eligible for the program. Due to increased interest in the PSOB program the BJA requires the immediate services of an organization to review both archived and closed Public Safety Officers' Benefits (PSOB) claim files to capture information in Work Flow (WF) data files; conduct a comprehensive and timely review of all PSOB claims filed and closed (approved, denied, and abandoned) from the implementation of the program to the present; and capture certain claim data in the recently-created PSOB case management Workflow (WF) to have the data electronically available in the future for reviews and reports. The NFFF is a nonprofit organization that was started in 1992 and for many years has worked with the PSOB Office to conduct bi-annual reviews of all firefighter claims in the NFPA Journal and its annual report on firefighter fatalities. The NFFF also recognizes and respects the sensitive and often complex nature of PSOB data and determinations. In 2008, the NFFF sponsored the first-ever PSOB Summit in Washington, D.C., in conjunction with the annual Fire Services Survivors Conference and provided community support in the event of a fatality. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS. However, all responsible parties who identify their interest and capability to satisfy this requirement will be considered. No solicitation will be issued, therefore, all requests for the solicitation will be considered non-responsive.

Right-of-Way Automated Monitoring Program 

Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.209(c). Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997): (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation; (b) Although “proposal” and “offeror” are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only.

SYNOPSIS
The U.S. Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA),   National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the Pipeline Research Council International (PRCI) are partnering to develop and apply remote sensing technology in the detection and mitigation of threats to pipeline integrity, including leak detection technology having application to carbon cycle science.  This partnership is soliciting information on related remote sensing instrument technology as described in this Request for Information (RFI). Information is being gathered to assess and evaluate the performance and capabilities of current technologies, including available technologies that are commercially off-the-shelf systems (COTS), as well as promising and emerging technologies that advance this program toward the end state vision. From the information responses, PHMSA, NASA and PRCI plan to select several technologies for demonstration projects. Successful demonstration projects may serve as the new technology prototypes for the PRCI member companies as they infuse new technology into their operational systems.  PRCI is a non-profit collaborative organization representing 39 of the world’s leading energy transportation pipeline companies, as well as technology developers and other organizations supporting the energy pipeline transportation industry. 
PHMSA and NASA have established a Memorandum of Understanding to work cooperatively on the Right-of-way Automated Monitoring (RAM) Program.  PHMSA, NASA and the pipeline industry working through PRCI, have initiated a multi-year effort to substantially advance the pipeline industry’s capability in detecting, identifying, communicating, and responding to the three (3) primary threats to pipeline operation and security:

1. Mechanical damage caused by third-party equipment and unauthorized    intrusion/encroachment;
2. Changes and ground disturbance caused by man-made activity and natural phenomenon (i.e., geologic and geophysical activity); and
3. Small leaks from operating systems.

** See attached document for full details regarding this RFI. **

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This is a market survey to locate potential sources of repair and maintenance for the AN/AVS-7(V) family HUD assemblies and subassemblies.  The HUD enables helicopter pilots to use the Aviators Night Vision Imaging System (ANVIS) goggles during flight operations.  The HUD provides critical operational information to the pilot superimposed over the ANVIS image.  The HUD minimizes the requirement for the pilot and co-pilot to look at the flight instruments, thus allowing them to concentrate on scanning outside of the cockpit.<BR><BR>  The government is seeking interested sources for the Repair and Maintenance of the AN/AVS-7(V) family of HUD systems.  The government intends to purchase these services using an indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery (IDIQ) contract over a five-year period. Respondents must have extensive knowledge of the ANVIS HUD system.   Potential offerors will be responsible for turning the nonfunctional components received from the government into ones which meet the most current operation form, fit and function as called out by applicable technical data within a repair cycle time of thirty (30) days.  This effort also requires the maintenance of a parts inventory sufficient to support the aforementioned repair cycle time.  Depot Maintenance Work Requirements (DMWRs) do not exist for this equipment.  A complete technical data package was never procured and therefore is unavailable.  The Government will not provide any test equipment or facilities for this effort.  <BR><BR>Any interested sources must send the following information, NLT 15 May 2009, to C-E LCMC IEW/S Directorate, ATTN: AMSEL-LC-IEW-N-II (Adam Butryn), Bldg. 1201, Ft.

The majority of the work under this contract will be done within the boundaries of the Huntington District.  If work is required outside the Huntington District, wage rates will be furnished and new line items included by modification.  One indefinite delivery contract will be negotiated and awarded with a base year and four option years.  The amount of the contract will not exceed $4,500,000.00 over the life of the contract. Work will be issued by negotiated firm-fixed price task orders. One of the two contracts will be awarded initially.  The remaining contract may be awarded within 12 months depending on workload and contracting requirements.  (Note: The remaining contract, if awarded, will also have a base period not to exceed one year with up to four additional option periods not to exceed one year each that may also be awarded.)    The criteria to be used in allocating task orders among the contracts will be based on the following: (1) contract minimums - task orders will be distributed to assure the guaranteed minimums are met; (2) past performance on previous task orders - the quality and timeliness of work delivered on prior jobs under the current contract;  (3) current capacity to accomplish the task order in the required time; (4) unique specialized experience; (5) equitable distribution of work among the contractors.   The first contract is anticipated to be awarded in August 2009.  This announcement is open to all businesses regardless of size.  If a large business is selected for this contract, it must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on the part of work it intends to subcontract.

<DESC>Application for Brand Name JustificationEach justification shall contain sufficient facts and rationale to justify the use of the specific authority cited. As required of FAR 6.302-1( c ), each justification shall include the following information:  1.   Requesting Agency:   Department of Veterans Affairs        Contracting activity:		Austin Automation Center1615 Woodward StreetAustin, TX 78772 2. Nature and/or description of the action:   Purchase of Software and Maintenance for Tech Refresh of the File and Print systems Disaster Recovery.  3.   A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value):    BMC Patrol, BMC Performance Assurance, Symantec Veritas Backup Reporter  and Veritas NetBack compatibility is required to be compatible with the existing AITC Patrol monitoring infrastructure and the Vertias NetBackup infrastructure.  This purchase is for the following:3 copies of Veritas Netbackup Enterprise Client 6.5 WIN Tier 2 Std Lic Gov Band S.   3 copies of Symantec Veritas Backup Reporter 6.5 XPLAT Std Lic Gov Band S.3 copies of BMC Performance Assurance Windows v7.1.2 w/ 1st year of maintenance.3 copies of BMC Patrol for MS Server w/1st year of maintenance.  4.   An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.      FAR Part 6.302-1   "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements"  5.  A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.  Selection of products not compatible with the functional and operation specifications of these products would incur excessive cost to re-engineer the existing AITC infrastructure and procure new hardware and software to support new centralized systems.   6.   A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.    This requirement will be solicited off the VA's AACES contract with Northrop Grumman.  This contract is an IDIQ contract that was competed several years ago to provide products and services in support of the Austin ITAC. 7.  A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.   AACES NGIT has already been competed.  The previous price competition ensures that the pricing of the latter orders are considered fair and reasonable.  8. A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.   Per FAR Part 8.001, the first required source of supply is Agency Inventory.  Ordering off of our own Agency's contract vehicle satisfies this requirement; therefore no other sources were reviewed for market research.  9. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as: (i) Explanation of why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available. (ii) When 6.302-1 is cited for follow-on acquisitions as described in 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), an estimate of the cost to the Government that would be duplicated and how the estimate was derived. (iii) When 6.302-2 is cited, data, estimated cost, or other rationale as to the extent and nature of the harm to the Government.   N/A10.  A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.     N/A  11.  A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.    See the answer to questions 8 and 5.

<a href="mailto:ssantoro@blm.gov">Santoro, Steven</a>
<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has a requirement for one or more pasture facilities to maintain from 200 to 1,000 wild horses each for one year, with 4 additional one year option periods. The facilities must be located in the Continental United States. The following sets forth the background of BLM's needs and the basic requirements needed for each Wild Horse & Burro Holding Facility:
On  December 8, 2004 Public Law 108-341; Section 142 amended the 1971 Wild and Free-roaming Horses and Burros Act ( Public Law 92-195) and requires the BLM to sell excess wild horses and burros which meet the following criteria:
Animals that are 11 years of age and older; orAnimals that have been offered unsuccessfully at three adoptions.
This may require the BLM to remove animals that meet the above criteria from the contracted facility during the course of the contract.  All animals that are in too poor of health to be prepared or transported will be released back to the pastures or humanely destroyed to avoid undo suffering.  All wild horses that do not meet the above criteria will remain in a free-roaming environment. 
Based on this Request for Proposal (RFP) the Bureau of Land Management anticipates the award of one or more contracts, each contract having the capacity to maintain 200 to 1,000 wild horses for long term wild horse holding facilities located in the continental United States.  Each contract shall be for one (1) base year, plus four (4) option years. The facilities must be prepared for the conduct of an Environmental Assessment (EA) and an inspection for specification compliance, to be performed by the BLM upon contract award.  Once a facility meets the minimum requirements of the EA and the specifications contained herein, BLM will begin shipping animals to the facility.  This is anticipated to occur within 90 calendar days from the date of award.  No payments shall be made until after animals are received at the facilities and have resided at the facility for a full one month period.  Contractor will be reimbursed on a per animal feed day basis for the previous month of service.  No advance payments are authorized.
Award of a contract(s) constitutes the first and only delivery order of the contract.  Subsequently, the Contracting Officers Representative (COR) will schedule the delivery and pickup of animals with the Contractor.
General ServicesThe contractor shall provide all necessary land, facilities, personnel and supplies to perform the following general tasks:  
Provide land, forage, shelter, salt, minerals, water and fences necessary to properly care for and maintain 200 to 1,000 (Based on the offerors proposal) wild horses grazing in pastures.  The pastures shall be capable of producing sufficient standing forage (12 animal unit months of forage per animal) to provide for most of the nutritional requirements of the animals on a yearlong basis.  The pastures must have sufficient rock and soil type to maintain proper hoof size and shape, without trimming.   The contractor must also provide supplemental feed as necessary to maintain the horses in good condition (i.e. during periods of drought, deep snow, ice storms, fire, during times when the forage is depleted of protein content or when other circumstances warrant).  Supplemental feeding is not intended to provide the entire forage intake for extended periods while in pastures and shall not be included in carrying capacity determinations; Provide corrals and adequate facilities to load and unload wild horses on an as needed basis; Unload, sort and segregate animals upon their arrival, in the event that additional horses are transported to the facility; Gather and move horses from pasture to pasture as needed, supervise their health and welfare, provide supplementary feed as needed and maintain the facilities in a safe condition; Gather and hold in isolation horses that fall under the criterion of adoptable or saleable wild horses for a minimum of 30 days, until time for shipment; Provide weekly monitoring of the animals to assess their health and determine death loss.  Prior to submission of the monthly invoice the contractor will conduct a complete inventory of all wild horses.  The results of the each inventory will be included in the monthly invoice.  Maintain a record keeping system that documents the frequency and results of these observations;Provide a record keeping system that identifies the location of each horse on site and other information, such as its overall condition, death, etc.  Each death will be recorded by the freeze mark and/or description of the animal, date the animal was noted as dead and then submitted on each months invoice.  The records shall be made available for duplication within 5 days after a request is made by the COR and/or PI;Dispose of the remains of dead horses.  The contractor may be required to euthanize horses that are suffering or are in pain, as an act of mercy.
Handling and GatheringIn the event that animals are transported to the facility, they will normally arrive at the site in trailer loads of approximately 35-40 head per load.  The contractor will provide a telephone number where they can be reached 24 hours per day for scheduling shipments.  BLM will attempt to schedule shipments for daytime arrival.  However, horses shall be unloaded immediately, regardless of arrival time.  The contractor will unload, sort by age, and condition, if determined to be appropriate by the Contracting Officers Representative (COR) and/or the Project Inspector (PI), into various groups.
All horses shall be handled, treated and maintained in a humane manner.  Horses in corrals and chutes shall be worked in a manner that minimizes excitement of the horses to prevent injuries from crowding or trampling.
Gathering or movement of horses from pastures shall be done with the concurrence of the COR and/or PI, except in emergency conditions, when the contractor determines an immediate gather or movement is necessary for the safety and welfare of the horses.  The contractor shall notify the COR and/or PI within 24 hours after such movement.  Handling of the horses will be kept to a minimum. However, it may be necessary to move the horses from one pasture to another because of range management practices.
Gathering for the purpose of removing animals will be conducted when it is deemed necessary by the COR/PI.  The gather time will be determined by the COR and/or PI.  A BLM designated representative will be on site during the gather.  The gather will be conducted in a humane manner.  Horses will be maintained in a corral area or small holding pasture for a minimum of 30 days, until notified by the COR and/or PI for shipment.  Contractor will provide sufficient labor and facilities to move and sort horses during holding prior to shipment. 
Corral/holding Facility - Corrals may be permanent or temporary (portable panels). It is anticipated that the corrals will be used to receive, hold, gather, ship and prepare horses.  The corrals must be at least 72" high and made of stoutly constructed material i.e. pipe, steel, lumber, etc.  No barbed wire will be allowed in the construction of corrals and any corral constructed of mesh wire (openings no larger than 2 by 4 inches) must be equipped with at least 3 wood sight boards (2 by 8 inches) located on the upper portion of the fence.  The three sight boards shall be spaced no more than 12 inches apart.  Corrals constructed of pipe or wood must have openings of not more than 12 inches between horizontal members.  Corrals and holding areas need to be free of protrusions, and hazards.  Corral gates shall be constructed of wood or pipe the same height as the fences.  Gates shall be visible to the horses either from the materials used in construction or by using materials such as plywood or plastic mesh placed on the gates.  The contractor will furnish a stable area (concrete or gravel) to place a hydraulic squeeze chute provided by the Bureau.  If electricity is unavailable the Bureau will provide a generator to run the hydraulic chute.  Two sorting corrals, each with a minimum of 2,500 square feet, which would be used for holding horses for short term (up to five days prior to shipment). 
Soil types in corrals/pens must be well drained and non-alkaline in nature.  Slopes within the pens shall provide for adequate drainage. 
At least two or more small pastures to maintain approximately 70 wild horses prior to shipment (30 days or more) will be necessary.  These pastures need to be accessible to the working corral, and constructed to have fencing to hold foals if needed during the weaning process.  Fencing must be constructed of small wire mesh, low to the ground to prevent a foal from going under the fencing.   The small pastures, described under (4) above, must have sufficient water for 70 wild horses at a rate of 16 gallons per animal, per day.
Adequate chutes and crowding alleys to facilitate gathering, preparing, and shipping animals.	The runway must have solid sides, have at least three sliding gates, be solidly constructed of steel or lumber, be at least 36' in length, 28-32" wide, and at least 72"tall.
Unloading and Working Facility - The facility shall have a loading and unloading chute, sufficient to safely unload and load semi trailer trucks and small stock trailers.  Chutes shall have solid sides which restrict the animals vision and will minimize the risk that animals may attempt to jump out of the chute.  Width of the chute must be at least 32 inches.    Fences shall be at a minimum of 72 inches high, stoutly constructed and made of lumber, pipe, or steel.
Fences - Perimeter fences shall be a minimum of 48" in height and completely enclose the facility.  Pasture division fences shall be a minimum of 48" in height.  All pasture fences shall consist of four strands of barbed wire or other acceptable fencing materials.  If determined by the COR and/or PI, it may be necessary for the contractor to flag certain fences with eight (8) inches of flagging attached to the top horizontal member of the fence every 20 feet to make the fences more visible to the horses. Gates, rather than cattle guards, shall be used at all fence openings to keep horses in pastures. 
Pastures - The facility shall have sufficient land and forage to sustain 200 to 1,000 (depending on the offerors proposal) wild horses year round. The pastures must have sufficient rock and soil type to maintain proper hoof size and shape, without trimming. The land must be privately owned by the offeror or the offeror must have long term control of the offered lands.  Offered lands cannot include public lands, BLM wild horse and burro herd areas, herd management areas or Forest Service Wild Horse and Burro Territories.  If any public lands, are within the privately owned or controlled land, the public lands must be fenced out and will not be used in the calculation of the stocking rate.  The private lands must be at least 10 miles from any BLM Wild Horse and Burro Herd Management Area, Herd Area and/or Forest Service Wild Horse and Burro Territory.  It is the responsibility of the offeror to verify that offered lands meet this requirement. Information on the location of BLM Wild Horse and Burro Herd Management Areas, Herd Areas and/or Forest Service Wild Horse and Burro Territory can be obtained by the Forest Service office or, for BLM land, by the BLM local office or the Wild Horse and Burro web site (www.wildhorseandburro.blm.gov.)  Pastures shall be of sufficient size to allow horses freedom of movement and exercise necessary for good health and to continue their free roaming behavior.  Pastures shall be free of hazards such as unfenced paved public highways.  If pastures are noncontiguous, they shall be managed as separate units, (no more than four units) each with a corral facility.  Horses shall not be moved from one unit to another except under extraordinary conditions and with the permission of the COR and/or PI.  The maximum allowable driving distance between all units combined shall be no greater than fifty (50) miles.
Sufficient land and forage shall be made available for the number of horses maintained.  However, as the herd is reduced by mortality or removal, pastures may be converted to domestic livestock use by the contractor, provided the use does not interfere with the wild horses.  Stocking domestic horses adjacent to or with the wild horses is unacceptable.
The available standing vegetation in pastures must be of sufficient nutritive quality and quantity to maintain the horses in good condition yearlong, with supplemental feeding as described in paragraph f, below.  Good condition is described as follows: ribs cannot be visually distinguished, but can be easily felt; backbone is not visible; hip bones do not show; withers are distinguishable but do not protrude; shoulders and neck blend smoothly into the body.  
The stocking rate for the site shall be adjusted as necessary to assure horses are maintained in good condition, as described above.
Shelter from the natural elements shall be provided in each pasture by the topography (e.g., canyons, hills, etc.), other natural features such as trees, or manmade structures.
Vegetation monitoring will be done by qualified personnel.  If vegetation utilization exceeds the moderate level, changes may need to be made so land health standards are maintained.
Supplemental Feed - Supplemental feed (primarily hay) shall be available at the site to feed the horses when natural forage nutritional value is low.  Supplemental feed shall be of such quality and fed in sufficient quantity to sustain the horses in good condition.  Supplemental feed shall not be fed to individual horses in declining health because of age and other natural causes.  Hay used as supplemental feed shall have a protein content of no less than 12%, be leafy, green, well cured, properly stored and free of dust, and mold.  Feed will be required daily for animals maintained in the corral areas, and supplemental feed will be required for pastured animals only during times when natural forage will not maintain the animals in good condition.  For example this could be during the winter months when the forage nutritional value is low.
Horses maintained in corrals shall be fed hay in sufficient quantity to sustain the horses in good condition.   Hay used shall have a protein content of 12%, be leafy, green, well cured, and free of dust, mold and weeds or grasses deemed unhealthy forage for wild horses. 
Feed Requirements - A good quality grass, grass/legume mix or legume hay shall be fed to and made available in sufficient quantity for each animal, with a crude protein not less than 12 percent.  While the animals are in the corral areas, they shall be fed at least 2.5 percent of body weight per day.  The COR may test supplement or hay to verify its quality. 
Inclement weather will stress animals, requiring that the volume of feed be increased to maintain their body flesh.
Water, Minerals, and SaltEach pasture shall have reliable water sources capable of supplying 16 gallons of clean water per horse, per day.  The maximum distance to water in any pasture shall be 4 miles.
Granulated, rock, or block salt shall be accessible to all horses in each pasture.
Minerals necessary to maintain the horses in good condition and that are deficient in the available forage in the care unit shall be provided to all horses in each pasture, either as a supplement or added to the salt.
Observation of Horses - The wild horses shall be observed by the contractor at a minimum of one (1) time per week, to determine the overall condition of the animals, and any deaths.  Observation will be conducted  more frequently when conditions warrant, i.e., during flooding, tornados, and the fire seasons, to ascertain their safety and well being and assure that fences are properly maintained.  Except in emergency situations, observations shall be carried out on foot, from a vehicle, or horseback.  In unusual situations, such as deep snow, etc., which make ground transportation impractical, aircraft may be used, with the prior approval of the COR and/or PI.  Prior to submission of the monthly invoice the contractor will conduct a complete inventory of all wild horses.  Records that document, as a minimum, the date of the observation, number and condition of the horses, problems and concerns of the observer, and the name(s) of individual(s) making the observation shall be maintained.  Any problems or concerns shall be reported to the COR and/or PI within 24 hours of discovery.
Access to the Facility - Access to the unloading and loading chute shall accommodate both trucks with stock trailers and semi-trucks.  Access shall be available during inclement weather.
Observation for the Public - The site is not intended to be a public viewing area.  Therefore, the contractor will restrict or prohibit access onto the site by the general public.
The contractor shall notify the COR and/or PI within 24 hours of any request from humane organizations, general public, media or wild horse interest groups, to observe the horses.  All such organizations and groups may be allowed to tour the site only under the approval and guidance of the COR and/or PI.
All requests to view the animals shall be directed to the COR and/or PI.
This is not intended to be a complete list of the specifications. The full requirement will be posted in solicitation L09PS000366, which will ONLY be available at http://www.fedconnect.net on or about May 6, 2009. This requirement is 100% set aside for small businesses under NAICS 115210. Hard copies of the solicitation will not be provided. Facsimile proposals will not be accepted. Vendors must be registered at http://www.ccr.gov to be considered for award.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCE SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.  This is not a solicitation or request for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this synopsis.  There is no solicitation or additional information available at this time. This synopsis is issued in accordance with the Federal Acquisition (FAR) Part 10.  This Sources Sought Notice is to determine the availability of small business HUB ZONE (certified or non-certified) sources, SERVICE DISABLED VETERAN, or SMALL DISADVANTAGED sources who are interested in submitting an offer on a proposed acquisition to provide fresh fruits and vegetables to each of the thirty (30) Area 2 military commissary store locations assigned to the Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA).

DeCA’s military commissaries are Government-owned facilities designed to operate similar to commercial retail supermarkets.  DeCA’s commissaries provide food items and other merchandise for resale to authorized shoppers at a cost savings when compared to the same or similar products sold in commercial retail markets.

DeCA is seeking small business concerns who qualify as HUB Zone (certified or non-certified), Service Disabled Veteran, and Small Disadvantaged Businesses who are capable of meeting the requirements listed below in providing a full line of fresh fruits and vegetable products and potted plants to 30 military commissary stores geographically located in the states of Wyoming, Nebraska, Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Texas, and Oklahoma.  The proposed NAICS for this acquisition is 424480, which sets the small business threshold at 500 employees.  

WEB-BASED ORDERING SYSTEM:
Contractors must be capable of providing and maintaining a licensed web-based retail ordering system.  The web-based system must have the capability to receive and process orders from all the commissary locations to be supported under any contract that may result from the proposed solicitation, send electronic price updates, create detailed sales and order history reports, and provide inventory management.  The contractor-owned pricing and ordering system must be able to interface with DeCA’s existing systems, i.e. allow DeCA personnel to access their system via the Internet without any additional cost or effort to DeCA.  Therefore, all the necessary software, equipment, and/or web page developments and/or enhancements shall be provided at no additional cost to the Government.  

CONTRACTOR FACILITY REQUIREMENTS:
The contractor shall be responsible for providing all necessary licenses, permits, supervision, facilities, equipment, order processing, distribution, inventory management, and personnel at the contractor’s own facilities/distribution center to receive, store, handle, sort, and deliver all required FF&V items to the various commissary locations that expect to be serviced.  

DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS:
Distribution is a key factor in a successful FF&V program. A successful distribution system relies on two main factors, a large volume of product movement and a sufficient number of well-placed distribution centers. When these two factors are present, customers will receive the freshest products available.  Each consolidation and/or distribution center utilized by the contractor in performance of the resulting contract shall have multiple temperature-controlled areas in order to meet the different recommended temperature requirements for the various products in order to maintain shelf life and ensure the FF&V received at each location is of the freshest and highest quality. The lead-time from order placement to product receipt at the store level for CONUS locations (Continental USA) will not exceed 24 hours.

USDA INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS:
The contractor shall work with United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) inspectors to ensure that all products are inspected, received, stored, staged, and shipped in accordance with USDA standards.  

ADDITIONAL SUPPORT REQUIREMENTS:

The contractor shall provide additional support and promotions to each commissary store in Area 2.  Additional support includes point of sale material, recipe cards, pamphlets, coupons, seasonal décor, and/or other material that is often available from produce commissions.  Additional support also includes value added services that are designed to enhance the overall produce program and increase customer satisfaction through a well-merchandised produce department.  Further, additional support includes weekly merchandising visits to each commissary store location, and periodic merchandising support during promotions, resets, and/or grand opening events that provide show-stopping merchandising techniques and SUPER sale priced items.

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:

Interested sources are required to respond to this sources sought synopsis by submitting a capabilities package to the contracting office NOT LATER THAN FRIDAY, MAY 8, 2009.  The capabilities package should include:
(1)  Business Size:  HUB ZONE (certified or non-certified) SERVICE DISABLED VETERAN-OWNED BUSINESS 
  SMALL DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS.

(2)  Abilities Statement: a short statement regarding the company’s ability to demonstrate existing, or developed, expertise and experience in relation to this proposed procurement.

(4)  Examples of projects worked within the last five years of similar size, scope and complexity as the work indicated.  Indicate whether your firm worked as a prime or subcontractor, contract value, business reference point of contact and phone number.

Once offers are received, the FAA will evaluate a single tier of offers according to the order of precedence specified above. If no award can be made at the first tier, the evaluation will proceed to the next lower tier until award can be made. As noted above, if applicable, Offerors must include their 8(a) or SDVOSB certification letters with their proposals.  
Interested parties responding to this solicitation are directed to the attached SIR.  All questions/inquires must be provided in writing to Maxwell Dubin maxwell.dubin@faa.gov no later than May 6, 2009, 12:00 pm (EDT).  Proposals are due no later than May 22, 2009 by 12:00 pm, (EDT).

<DESC>The Expandable Light Air Mobile Shelter (ELAMS) is a mobile shelter that can be used for Tactical Operations Centers (TOC).  These shelters include a tactical generator, Environmental Control Unit (ECU), and are deployable in 8-10 minutes.  Additionally, these shelters can be transported on most trucks and flat racks.  The Contingency Response Communications System (CRCS) is a mobile system that can be attached to the back of High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWV) or commercial pick-up trucks.  These systems feature 24-channel radio interoperability, streaming video, wireless internet, Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP) phone, and satellite reach-back capability.  These systems will reduce the footprint of the headquarters, improve communications interoperability, reduce equipment damage during transport and setup, and free up manpower for critical tasks.

<DESC><p><br /><br />REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) SUMMARY:</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: Global Combat Support System-Joint (GCSS-J) program is an Acquisition Category 1AC/Major Automated Information System (ACT 1AC/MAIS) IT application that continues to transition to a service oriented architecture to deliver asset visibility to the joint logistician (i.e., essential capabilities, functions, activities, and tasks necessary to sustain all elements of operating forces in theater at all levels), and facilitates information interoperability across and between Combat Support and Command and Control functions. GCSS-J provides applications, decision support tools, and visualization mechanisms that enable the joint logistician to rapidly assess and analyze information to make critical decisions.</p>
<p>In an agile development environment (build a little, test a little) design, development, integration, and testing occur in parallel and continuously through a series of sprints. Each sprint development cycle is approximately 4 weeks long. GCSS-J has implemented an agile development process to rapidly develop and deliver critical capabilities to the joint logistics warfighter. This strategy supports fielding, at a minimum, two capability releases annually replacing the traditional "block" approach of releasing capabilities/functionality every 18 months.</p>
<p>Capabilities can be defined as system enhancements, functional enhancements to existing GCSS-J capabilities and applications, integration of external applications via single sign-on, or federating external applications via Unified Resource Locator, making joint logistics applications accessible via GCSS-J in a fully integrated manner. GCSS-J is available on both the Secure Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet) and Non-secure Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNet) and includes net-centric services as they are available and practical to use via Network Centric Enterprise Services (NCES). GCSS-J requires a SIPRNet Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificate, and for the NIPRNet, a Common Access Card (CAC).</p>
<p>REQUIREMENT: This is a Nonpersonal service as defined in FAR Part 37.101. The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), Global Combat Support System-Joint (GCSS-J) Program Management Office (PMO), in coordination with DISA's Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO), is requesting information to determine sources with CORE competencies and demonstrated experience in developing and sustaining combat support/combat support services (CS/CSS) software for the GCSS-J.</p>
<p>To achieve the mission requirements, GCSS-J requires an innovative and technically capable contractor team who understands state-of-the-art technology, web services technology, service oriented architecture (SOA), agile development processes, and has a large number of readily available software development engineers that can be matrixed into the GCSS-J activities on an as needed basis. Proven expertise and capabilities in the areas of software development and integration, systems engineering, integration strategies, security, testing and evaluation, maintenance and operations, and licensing are required to support customers in multiple functional mission areas. The availability of adequate personnel resources to ensure a smooth Program transition is also necessary. Anticipate that there will be approximately a 3-6 month transition period with the incumbent contractor Northrop Grumman Mission Systems.</p>
<p>RESPONSES TO RFI: All responses are limited to 5 pages (excluding the cover page), using a Microsoft Word format (i.e., 1 inch margins, Times New Roman 12 font). The responses should specifically describe the contractor's ability to meet the requirements outlined in the RFI and address the attached questions. Please include company's name, point of contact, address, phone number, DUNS number, CAGE Code, Tax ID and business size. Marketing Brochures will not be considered adequate information as a response to this RFI. All small businesses to include Small Disadvantaged, HUBZone, Women-Owned and Service Disabled are strongly encouraged to submit their responses.&nbsp; Questions and responses to the RFI must be submitted via email to the following Kody.Moghaddassi@disa.mil, Edward.Frank@disa.mil &amp; Randy.Dreyer@disa.mil by 2:00 pm (est.) on May 4, 2009.</p>
<p><br />DISCLAMER: This request for information (RFI) is issued solely for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation. Neither unsolicited proposals nor any other kinds of offers will be considered in response to this RFI or accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Contractors are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. All information received in response to this RFI that is marked proprietary or confidential will be treated accordingly. Information received in response to this RFI will not be returned. The purpose of this RFI is to gather potential sources that have the capabilities to provide the GCSS-J services for the Defense Information Systems Agency.</p>

This special legislation authorized the Secretary to determine the appropriate reimbursement for these services. To learn more about the Fee Program access http://www.nonvacare.va.gov/  .CURRENT ENVIRONMENTAll claims pricing done by the VA systems described below may be sent to re-pricing agent to see if they can provide a better price for the service. Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS)The pricing transactions for IPPS are created by VistA (The Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture) system using either data previously entered into VistA Fee (from Fee Basis Invoice file) or data entered electronically by a user and are processed using Medicare Code Editor (3M product), MS-DRG Grouper (CMS product - Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services), PPS Pricer (CMS product), and COBOL interface programs (developed in-house) on z/OS Enterprise Server.  The Pricer reports and Reject reports are transmitted to each station (over 170 VA Medical Centers located nation-wide) three times a day.  The current system can process transactions using proper schedules/versions as old as fiscal year 1998.  All pricing results are saved in Fee History file and available for audit purposes.Outpatient and Inpatient AncillaryThe VistA Fee Basis software has two built-in schedules for pricing outpatient and inpatient ancillary claims.  It contains the Medicare Physician Fee schedule (RBRVS) and the VA Fee schedule (75th percentile).  If the service is provided under an existing vendor contract, then the VA pays the contracted amount.  If it is not provided under a current contract and is subject to the Medicare Physician Fee schedule (RBRVS), then the amount from that schedule is paid.  If it is not subject to RBRVS, the VA Fee schedule is used assuming there was an amount calculated for the fiscal year for that service on that schedule.  There are exceptions; i.e., Dental services are paid using a different schedule and Mill Bill (emergency care) is paid at 70% of the applicable Medicare schedule.OthersDesktop applications - either CMS PC Pricers or Excel worksheets based on Medicare Fee schedules that are downloadable from CMS are used at some sites.  POINT OF CONTACTAll questions and/or documentation should be submitted electronically in a Word document format to Angela Deren at Angela.Deren@va.gov using subject line of "Response to RFI for Pricer" Questions subject line should be "Questions on RFI for Pricer"GENERAL INFORMATION & DISCLAIMERThis RFI, as defined in FAR 15.201 (e), is conducted to determine available software/applications in the current market that meet services described below.  This information is being obtained for information purposes only and the Government will not reimburse for any cost incurred as a result of this request.   Vendors are requested to provide information with sufficient documentation to allow for the evaluation of the potential solution to meet the Government's requirements.  There is no solicitation document available at this time and no guarantee that one will be forthcoming.    FAR 52.215-3 Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997) (a)	The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. (b)	Although "proposal" and "offer" are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal. (c)	This solicitation is issued for the purpose of obtaining information on a possible permanent pricing system described above.

<p>NAICS CODE: 541712</p>
<p>FEDERAL AGENCY NAME: Air Force Research Laboratory, Munitions Directorate, Contracting Division (AFRL/RWK), Eglin AFB FL</p>
<p>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT TITLE: Sub-millimeter Wave Imaging Fuze Technology (SWIFT)</p>
<p>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial Announcement</p>
<p>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT NUMBER: BAA-RWK-09-0007</p>
<p>PROPOSAL DUE DATE AND TIME: Proposals will be due by 2:00 p.m. CDT, 28 May 2009, delivered to AFRL/RWK, Attn: Ms Connie Homan, 101 West Eglin Blvd, Suite 337, Eglin AFB FL 32542-6810. Proposals received after this due date and time shall be governed by the provisions of FAR 52.215-1(c) (3). See Section IV for additional information. It should be noted that this installation observes strict security procedures to enter the facility. These security procedures are NOT considered an interruption of normal Government processes, and proposals received after the above stated date and time as a result of security delays will be considered "late".

Early proposal submission is encouraged.</p>
<p>I. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory, Munitions Directorate is soliciting technical and cost proposals on the following research effort: Sub-millimeter Wave Imaging Fuze Technology (SWIFT). It is anticipated one contractor's proposal will be selected for award of one Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. However, the Government reserves the right to award one, multiple or no contracts pursuant to this BAA.</p>
<p>1. Statement of Objective/Needs: The main objective of this effort is to demonstrate the feasibility and potential application of active imaging sub-millimeter wave RF fuze sensors for use on air-launched munitions. SWIFT intends to explore the benefits of increased resolution and smaller hardware by operating at sub-millimeter wavelengths. At a minimum, potential solutions to this technology need to include a breadboard sensor capable of operation at sub-millimeter wave frequencies.</p>
<p>In order to demonstrate the SWIFT technology, a successful offeror would:</p>
<p>a. (TO 0001) Design, build, and demonstrate a breadboard sub-millimeter wave active imaging fuze radar.</p>
<p>b. (TO 0002) Collect calibrated data of targets and/or clutter using the breadboard sub-millimeter wave imaging fuze radar.</p>
<p>c. (TO 0003) Use data from Task 2 to validate synthetic RF scene generation tools at the sub-millimeter wave design frequency and to evaluate feasibility of advanced active imaging radar signal processing techniques.</p>
<p>Specific information regarding requirements and task descriptions can be found in Annex 1 of this BAA. Offerors should forward their request for Annex 1 of this BAA to the Government in strict accordance with the requirements of Section I Part 5.f.</p>
<p>2. Deliverable Items: The following data submittals are expected to be included on the awarded contract. Requirement Title and Data Item Description (DID) are provided as follows:</p>
<p>a. Monthly Status Reports (Status Report: DI-MGMT-80368A)</p>
<p>b. Monthly Performance and Cost Report (Performance and Cost Report: DI-FNCL-80912)</p>
<p>c. Project Planning Chart (Project Planning Chart: DI-MGMT-80507B)</p>
<p>d. Program review agenda, charts, minutes, and presentation material (Presentation <br />Material: DI-ADMN-81373)</p>
<p>e. Design drawings (Developmental Design Drawings and Associated Lists: DI-SESS-81002D)</p>
<p>f. Test Plans (Test Plan: DI-NDTI-80566A)</p>
<p>g. Test Data (Test/Inspection Report: NI-NDTI-80809B)</p>
<p>h. Software (code, simulation modes/tools) developed or purchased under contract (Computer Software Product End Items: DI-MCCR-80700)</p>
<p>i. Final technical report (Scientific and Technical Reports (Final Report): DI-MISC-80711A). The Final Report, which will be published in Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC), must document the entire effort and must include relevant data and results from other technical data that would not otherwise be published.</p>
<p>j. The contractor may propose additional elements or submittal of combined elements or DIDs as appropriate for the proposed program</p>
<p>k. In addition, the contractor shall deliver Hardware (breadboard sensor, mounting hardware, interface cards) developed or purchased under contract at the conclusion of the program</p>
<p>3. Meetings and Reviews: The Government anticipates the following program meetings and reviews: Kickoff within a month of contract start date at contractor's facilities; Technical Interchange Meetings once a quarter at the contractor's facilities; and a Final Program review at Eglin AFB FL. The contractor may propose to conduct or participate in other meetings with subcontractors, Government agencies, or third parties, as deemed necessary.</p>
<p>4. Schedule: The SWIFT contract is expected to last 30 months under Task 1 with an additional 12 months under Task 2 and 24 months under Task 3. If awarded (see paragraph II (a) below), Task 2 and 3 may run concurrently with Task 1, and the entire program is envisioned to be completed within 42 months. These timelines are recognized to be dependent on actual program progress made in earlier Task Orders and will be negotiated prior to Task Order award.</p>
<p>5. Other Requirements:</p>
<p>a. Program security classification: It is expected that most of this program will be conducted at the UNCLASSIFIED level. However, a DD Form 254 will be required for the awarded contract. Offerors must verify their Cognizant Security Office information is current with Defense Security Service (DSS) at www.dss.mil. Based upon the proposed technical approach, the Government may provide a Security Classification Guide at contract award or during the performance of the contract.</p>
<p>b. TEMPEST requirements: TEMPEST requirements do not apply to this program</p>
<p>c. International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and Public Law 98-94 (export control) will apply to this effort.</p>
<p>d. Certified DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, is required to be submitted with the request for Annex 1 and the proposal.</p>
<p>e. It is anticipated that all data delivered under any resulting award will be delivered with unlimited rights. However different rights may be negotiated as appropriate. The Government prefers the proposed SWIFT design include no parts, materials, methods, or software that are proprietary. Proposals shall identify any proprietary materials, products, software, or processes to be used by the prime or subcontractor(s) in the performance of this program, and shall address acquisition of data rights or licenses, or expected recoupment of development costs for those proprietary items that will be integral to the SWIFT design prior to contract award.</p>
<p>f. Request for Annex 1: Contractors must obtain Annex 1, SWIFT Technical Data Package, by sending a written request with the following:</p>
<p>i. Certified copy of a DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement <br />ii. Cognizant Defense Security Service office name and address<br />iii. Facility Security Officer's name, phone, email and fax<br />iv. Name, phone, email and fax of the person to receive the annex<br />v. Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code<br />vi. Approved mailing address</p>
<p>Requests can either be mailed or faxed to Mr Robert Orgusaar and Lt Kurt Nakamura (see Section VII Part 2). After acceptance of these items, this data package may be obtained in person or via mail. Requests should be provided early enough to allow the Government 14 days to provide the document. The contractor must request release of export-controlled data related to the SWIFT program, and must identify an individual who will be responsible for controlling this data. No supplemental documentation will be provided unless requested in strict accordance with these instructions.</p>
<p>g. Subcontracting Plans will be required in accordance with FAR 19.702 Statutory Requirements.</p>
<p>6. Other Information:</p>
<p>a. Government Furnished Property (GFP) Availability: The Government may assist in providing GFP, based on availability, if requested. The offeror shall include a detailed list of Government resources, with their associated approximate value, required to execute a contract in a timely and cost effective manner. Additional resources and points of contact may be found in Annex 1.</p>
<p>b. Contractors are encouraged to integrate their "front-end" radar design with Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake's Missile Engagement Simulation Arena (MESA) "back-end" signal modulator and data acquisition system. This has the potential to reduce radar development costs under Task 1. The decision to integrate hardware with MESA or design and fabricate a new, independent radar system is left to the contractor. However, the Government plans to use MESA in Task 2 and Task 3 as a test facility regardless of whether the contractor builds their own radar system or decides to integrate theirs with MESA's back-end hardware. More information can be found in Annex 1.</p>
<p>c. Base Support/ Network Access: Base support and network access do not apply to this program. <br /><br />II. AWARD INFORMATION</p>
<p>1. Contract Type: The Government anticipates negotiating a single Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee type contract for this effort. It is expected that the SWIFT program will consist primarily of Task Order 0001. The Government expects to fund up to approximately $1.25M on the contract for TO 0001 (see paragraph II.b). However, an IDIQ contract will allow Task Order 0002 and 0003 to be awarded in order to accommodate incremental developments and additional funding, should it become available. Accordingly, it is anticipated the IDIQ contract will bear a ceiling amount of approximately $3M.</p>
<p>2. Anticipated Funding: The Government expects to fund up to approximately $1.25M for TO 0001. This figure includes approximately $420K, $450K, $277K, and $104K in each of FY09-FY12, respectively. This funding profile is an estimate only and will not be a contractual obligation for funding. All funding is subject to change due to government discretion and availability. All potential offerors should be aware that due to unanticipated budget fluctuations, funding in any or all areas may change with little or no notice. The ceiling maximum for the IDIQ contract will be approximately $3 million in order to accommodate incremental developments and additional funding, should it become available. The guaranteed minimum order quantity will be the value of TO 0001.</p>
<p>3. Anticipated Number of Awards: The Government anticipates awarding a single contract for the entire effort. However, the Government reserves the right to award one, multiple, or no contracts pursuant to this BAA.</p>
<p>4. Anticipated Award Date: 17 July 2009</p>
<p>5. Anticipated Period of Performance: The baseline IDIQ SWIFT program contract ordering period will be 5 years in order to allow for the addition of in-scope tasks and incremental developments and additional funding, should it become available. Task 1 is anticipated to take approximately 30 months. Task 2 is anticipated to take approximately 12 months, and Task 3 approximately 24 months should additional funding become available. If awarded, Task 2 and 3 may run concurrently with Task 1, and the entire program is envisioned to be completed within 42 months. These timelines are recognized to be dependent on actual program progress made in earlier Task Orders and will be negotiated prior to Task Order award. The period of technical performance encompasses the entire program minus the last three months needed to deliver the Final Technical Report.</p>

<p>1. Support Contractors: Only Government employees will evaluate the proposals for selection. AFRL/RW has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>2. Communication: Dialogue between prospective offerors and Government representatives is encouraged until submission of proposals. Discussions with any of the points of contact shall not constitute a commitment by the Government to subsequently fund or award any proposed effort. Only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>3. Debriefings: When requested, a debriefing will be provided. The debriefing process will follow the time guidelines set out in 10 USC 2305(b)(5), but the debriefing content may vary to be consistent with the procedures that govern BAAs (FAR 35.016).</p>
<p>4. Wide Area Work Flow Notice: Any contract award resulting from this announcement will contain the clause at DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission Of Payment Requests, which requires electronic submission of all payment requests. The clause cites three possible electronic formats through which to submit electronic payment requests. Effective 01 October 2006, the Department of Defense adopted Wide Area Work Flow-Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA), as the electronic format for submission of electronic payment requests. Any contract resulting from this announcement will establish a requirement to use WAWF-RA for invoicing and receipt/acceptance, and provide coding instructions applicable to this contract. Contractors are encouraged to take advantage of available training (both web-based and through your cognizant DCMA office), and to register in the WAWF-RA system. Information regarding WAWF-RA, including the web-based training and registration, can be found at https://wawf.eb.mil/ . Note: WAWF-RA requirement does not apply to Universities that are audited by an agency other than DCAA.</p>
<p>5. Item Identification and Valuation: Any contract award resulting from this announcement may contain the clause at DFARS 252.211-7003, Item Identification and Valuation, (Apr 2005) which requires unique item identification and valuation of any deliverable item for which the government's unit acquisition cost is $5,000 or more; subassemblies, components, and parts embedded within an item valued at $5,000 or more; or items for which the government's unit acquisition cost is less than $5,000 when determined necessary by the requiring activity for serially managed, mission essential, or controlled inventory. Also included are any DoD serially managed subassembly, component, or part embedded within a delivered item and the parent item that contains the embedded subassembly, component, or part. Per DFARS 211.274-3 policy for valuation, it is DoD policy that contractors shall be required to identify the government's unit acquisition cost for all items delivered, even if none of the criteria for placing a unique item identification mark applies. Therefore, your proposal must clearly break out the unit acquisition cost for any deliverable items. Per DFARS 211.274-3 policy for valuation, "the government's unit acquisition cost is the contractor's estimated fully burdened unit cost at time of delivery to the government for cost type or undefinitized line, subline, or exhibit line items" (per DoD, "fully burdened unit costs" to the government would include all direct, indirect, G&amp;A costs, and an appropriate portion of fee.). If you have questions regarding the unique item identification requirements, please contact the contracting point of contact listed above. For more information, see the following website: http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/uid/ .</p>
<p>6. Forward Pricing Rate Agreements: Offerors who have forward pricing rate agreements (FPRA's) should submit them with their proposal.</p>
<p>7. Excessive Pass-Through Charges: Any contract award resulting from this announcement may contain the clause at DFARS 252.215-7004, Excessive Pass-Through Charges, (Apr 2007) which requires the contractor to identify in its proposal the percentage of effort to be performed by the prime contractor and the percentage expected to be performed by each subcontractor. If the contractor intends to subcontract more than 70% of the total cost of work under the contract or task order, then it shall identify the amount of the contractor's indirect costs and profit applicable to the subcontract work, and a description of the value added by the contractor. If any subcontractor intends to subcontract to a lower tier subcontractor more than 70% of the total cost of its work, then it shall identify the amount of the subcontractor's indirect costs and profit applicable to the lower tier subcontract work, and a description of the value added by the subcontractor.</p>
<p>8.

<p>Address any questions pertaining to this announcement to the points of contacts (POCs) listed above.</p>
<p>This announcement does not request any proposals at this time. The purpose of this announcement is to provide information on an industry day for the Metamaterials for RF Antenna Applications program (STROEB II BAA Call 2). The objective of this program is to demonstrate the utility of RF metamaterials technologies in advancing the state of the art in RF antenna technology. AFRL seeks to advance these metamaterial-based RF antenna concepts beyond proof-of-principle toward functional RF antennas well exceeding the current state-of-the-art. Three specific applications have been identified: (a) low-frequency antennas, (b) anti-jam GPS antennas, and (c) high-frequency telemetry antennas. For the low-frequency band (30-300MHz), the objective is to build an antenna that is significantly smaller than a standard antenna without sacrificing important functionality such as gain or bandwidth. For GPS antennas, the objective is to build a small jam resistant antenna capable of being incorporated into small UAVs. The vertically-polarized telemetry antenna must operate over the entire telemetry band (1.4-6.7GHz), have the capability to handle 70W peak power, possess a 3dB gain on the horizon to 0dB at the zenith and, ideally, be conformable to the airframe. The Metamaterials for RF Antenna Applications Industry Day will be held on 3 April 2009 from 0900 - 1300. Registration will begin at 0730 with the formal presentation beginning at 0900 at One Liberty Center, 875 N. Randolph Street, 14th floor, Arlington VA. The intent of the event is to provide potential offerors information on the program.</p>
<p>The event will be limited to interested representatives of U.S. Government agencies and U.S. Contractors only. No foreign participation is allowed. Contractor participation will be subject to the same restrictions specified in the STROEB BAA. Entities/Firms/Organizations are limited to two (2) participants/representatives per entity/firm/organization due to limited space. If you are interested in attending, please register via the online registration site https://www.enstg.com/Signup/default.cfm?ThisCode=SEN37783. The registration deadline is Monday, 30 March 2009 and confirmation will be sent NLT Wednesday, 1 April 2009. Map information for the facility and local hotels will be provided within the registration site. If you have any questions regarding registration or conference location, please contact David Fishman at fishman_david@bah.com.</p>
<p>The Conference May Contain ITAR Data. No foreign owned firms or foreign nationals are allowed to participate in this conference.</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A CALL FOR PROPOSALS<br />DO NOT SUBMIT PROPOSALS AT THIS TIME<br />ANY PROPOSALS RECEIVED WILL BE DISREGARDED</p>

<DESC>The Department of Commerce/National Institute of Standards and Technology intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Altair Engineering Inc., 1820 E. Big Beaver Rd. Troy, MI 480832031. Altair Gridworks license is used for mesh generation, pre-processing, and post-processing of finite element models for a variety of different solver packages, including ABAQUS, ANSYS, and LS-DYNA. NIST is currently using the software in the windows XP environment. The Altair GridWorks license package offers extensive model development and post-processing tools for the specific finite element solvers that NIST uses. GridWorks is the only package that offers full compatibility with (1) a large number of existing finite element models that NIST has created; (2) a large number of post-processed finite element model results files that NIST has created; and (3) macros that NIST has created for automatic finite element model generation. Renewing this license will enable NIST to maximize productivity on mission-critical projects. 

A fixed price purchase order will be issued on or about May 1, 2009. 
The Government intends to solicit only this one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b). Interested concerns may identify their capabilities by submitting a capability statement that demonstrates in written narrative format their ability to meet the requirement and objectives as described in this synopsis. Capability statements may be emailed to Barbara.Suhrie@nist.gov. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice is not a request for quotation.  A determination by the Government whether to compete this proposed requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC><p>NOAA's Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, Mountain Region Acquisition Division, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with Johns Hopkins University/Applied Physics Lab (JHU/APL) of Laurel, Maryland for science grade processing code and related technical support for the Space Environmental Monitor National Polar-Orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite ( NPOESS) Space Environmental Monitor (SEM-N).
<p>The sole source determination is based on NOAA's requirement for scientific software. The NPOESS Satellite is being built by Northrop Grumman for the Department of Commerce and NASA. One of the payloads on NPOESS is the SEM-N instrument which is being built by JHU/APL. Software is required to communicate environmental data from the satellite to earth. JHU/APL is uniquely qualified to prepare the software science code and perform integration testing, user documentation and technical support after delivery. As developer of the satellite, JHU/APL has the unique knowledge to successfully create the software in the timeframes required for the project. The SEM-N hardware is based on heritage designs from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP), the Polar Operational Environmental Satellite (POES) and NASA satellites. JHU-APL is responsible for developing the SEM-N flight hardware consisting of a low-energy electron and proton detector, a medium-energy electron and ion detector, a high-energy proton detector, and the interface control element between the sensor and the spacecraft. <br />The NPOESS space environmental and sensor data records (EDRs/SDRs) are based on current operational products having well established algorithms. It is anticipated that the EDR/SDR processing codes for the SEM-N will be derived, in part, from the existing operational codes for the DMSP and POES and from available NASA science codes. JHU-APL has the unique knowledge and experience with the legacy sensors and the interface design between the sensor suite and the spacecraft to readily develop science-grade processing code and provide technical support in the time period required.<br />The SEM- N hardware is currently in the design phase. The science algorithms will need to be developed and tested prior to the integrated functional testing in mid-2011. This relatively short time precludes an extended period for learning the intricacies of the environmental records from multiple satellite programs, sensor suite spacecraft interface and design, and developing the necessary algorithm code.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can provide&nbsp;the service&nbsp;that fully meets the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website located at http://www.fbo.gov, the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) website located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/, and the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition website located at http://www.crane.navy.mil/acquisition/homepage.htm.

However, the NECO webpage as well as the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition webpage serve as alternatives if the FBO website is unavailable.
PURPOSE AND BACKGROUND:  Announcement N00164-07-R-4831 was released to determine potential sources for a Weapon Shot Counter (WSC) compatible with the Special Forces Combat Assault Rifle (SCAR) family of weapons.  Very limited requirements were presented in the announcement.  The purpose of this announcement is to expand upon those requirements for the WSC-SCAR and continue dialogue with industry and academia to refine those requirements.      
OBJECTIVE:  The objective of this announcement is to release a revised draft performance specification for WSC-SCAR with the intent to elicit comment from industry and academia to help further shape the specification before solicitation.  The Closing Date for receipt of comments on the revised draft WSC-SCAR performance specification is Friday, 22 May 2009.  
PARTICIPATION:  Failure to provide written feedback to the revised draft performance specification will not preclude abstaining vendors from bidding on possible future solicitations.  This announcement is part of the full-, free-, and open- competition process, which encourages industry and academia to help shape Government specifications to match what is possible, affordable, and timely.  Failure to provide written feedback may result in a future Government performance specification over which the abstaining vendors have limited influence in the acquisition process, and may deprive abstaining vendors of potentially valuable direct early interaction with contracting officials and acquisition planners.
ADDITIONAL NOTES:  It should be noted that during the course of this acquisition program, the Government plans to utilize employees from Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), Weapons System Technology Integration Center (WSTIAC), Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH), and other direct Government contractors as advisors to the Government participants.  
This announcement does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the Government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  The U. S. Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement.  Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement will NOT be reimbursed.  Any information provided that is marked as proprietary information will be safeguarded to prevent disclosures to non-government personnel and entities.  Your interest is this program is appreciated.
Questions should be directed to Ms. Stacy McAtee, Contracting Officer, Code 0562NS, telephone 812-854-1988, fax 812-854-5095, e-mail stacy.mcatee@navy.mil.  Complete mailing address is: Code 0562NS, Bldg. 3422, NSWC Crane, 300 Highway 361, Crane, IN  47522-5001.   Please reference the above solicitation number when responding to this notice.

<CONTACT>David H Plagge, Contracting Officer, Phone (513) 487-2022, Fax (513) 487-2107, Email plagge.david@epa.gov
<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  
The purpose of this Modification 39 is to obligate $40,000 in initial funding in support of Work Assignment (WA 3-103).  The period of performance for this work assignment will be from April 13, 2009 though March 31, 2010.  

WA 3-103 is to support the development of tools and training aligned with the unique aspects of the ARRA for Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) State programs and the borrower community of the DWSRF.  This support will include: (a) participating in and providing support to a full day working session with the DWSRF program to support the development of a program oversight strategy for the unique needs of the ARRA funds.  The contractor shall provide its expertise in program management, financial management, auditing and risks, and data management;  (b) developing a means to transfer data from the DWSRF’s Project Management System to the Office of Management & Budget’s (OMB) Recovery.gov website;  and (c) supporting two (2) web seminars on the DWSRF and ARRA.  This support for the webinars shall consist of getting a web seminar service, managing registration, and recording questions and answers during the web seminars.  

Work Assignment 3-101 was amended on April 16 to add contractor support in modifying the existing Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) Benefits Reporting (CBR) Database for tracking ARRA funds for the 51 State CWSRF programs.  Modification of the database will include the addition of approximately 20 new data fields and the development of data definitions for all new data fields.  The new data definitions should be added to the existing CBR data definitions file.  The contractor shall expand the CBR database to allow for the tracking of ARRA assistance to the District of Columbia and 3 U.S. Territories.  

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures.  However, the Office of Management and Budget’s guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency’s Office of Water (OW) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  The existing OW contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government’s risk.  In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OW contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.

<DESC>U.S. SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION
Small Business Size Standards: Waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule
AGENCY:  U.S. Small Business Administration.
ACTION: Notice of Periodic Review of Approved Class Waivers from the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Products in Effect as of March 17, 2009.
SUMMARY:  The U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is conducting a periodic review of approved class waivers from the Nonmanufacturer Rule for products in effect as of March 17, 2009.  The purpose of this notice is to determine if there are any small business manufacturers or processors for the products listed on the list of approved class waivers.  The basis for a waiver is that no small business manufacturers are supplying these classes of products to the Federal government.  The effect of a waiver would be to allow otherwise qualified small businesses dealers to supply the products of any manufacturer on a Federal contract set aside for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or participants  in SBA’s 8(a) Business Development Program.
DATE: Comments and source information must be submitted within [30 DAYS AFTER DATE OF PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES].
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Edith G. Butler, Program Analyst, by telephone at (202) 619-0422; by FAX at (202) 481-1788; or my email at Edith.Butler@sba.gov.


SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Section 8(a)(17) of the Small Business Act (Act), 15 U.S.C.§ 637(a)(17), requires that recipients of Federal contracts set aside for small businesses, or SBA’s 8(a) Business Development Program provide the product of a small business manufacturer or processor, if the recipient is other than the actual manufacturer or processor of the product. SBA’s regulations provided the same for procurements set aside for service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns 13 CFR 125.15.  This requirement is commonly referred to as the Nonmanufacturer Rule.  See 13 CFR §121.406(b).  Section 8(a)(17)(b)(iv) of the Act authorizes SBA to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for any "class of products" for which there are no small business manufacturers or processors available to participate in the Federal market.  
	In order to be considered available to participate in the Federal market for a class of products, a small business manufacturer must have submitted a proposal for a contract solicitation or received a contract from the Federal government within the last 24 months. 13 C.F.R. § 1202(c). The SBA defines "class of products" based on the Office of Management and Budget’s North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), and product service codes.  
	The following are products listed on SBA’s list of Approved Class Waivers in Effect as of March 17, 2009.

<DESC>This notice constitutes a Request for Information/Comment only, THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION:  No award will be made for this effort at this time.<BR><BR>The United States Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC) and the Program Manager - Clothing and Individual Equipment (PM-CIE) are requesting information regarding commercial cleaning methodologies for portable cleaning products for Cordura based equipment.<BR><BR>Objective: <BR>To identify opportunities for research, development, commercialization and distribution of a product that cleans and sanitizes military Cordura based items without affecting its physical properties and is small enough to transport and utilize in remote environments. <BR><BR>General Information:<BR>Service members are issued large quantities of Cordura based equipment items.  Over time, and particularly in combat environments, these items become extremely soiled with dirt and stained with bodily fluids (perspiration, etc.), oils, etc.  The purpose of this RFI is to find a novel method of cleaning that is less time, water, and effort intensive.  The current method of cleaning Cordura based items requires the Warfighter to hand wash items in cold or lukewarm water using a mild detergent or soap.  The ballistic vest is a particularly time intensive item to clean, and requires the Warfighter to remove ballistic inserts prior to hand washing.  Badly soiled areas are scrubbed with a soft bristled brush and rinsed thoroughly in clean, lukewarm water until suds are completely gone.  Items are then air-dried out of direct sunlight to decrease ultra violet degradation to the equipment.  <BR><BR>An ideal solution would be a small (2x6) durable, leak proof, self contained spot cleaning product.  As a spot cleaner product will clean the dirtiest sections of an item and would therefore be less time and effort intensive than the current practice.    The product shall consist of a controllable release interface, cleaning agent (chemical or organic, liquid or solid) and a method of agitation (brush).  The method of removing the cleaning agent and lifted stains of Cordura is to be specified in the response, but does not need to be a part of product.  Use of water and a cleaning cloth are acceptable methods of cleaning.  The use of chlorine bleach, yellow soap, and other heavy duty cleaning agents is not authorized.  As mentioned above, after the cleaning process the Cordura item shall air dry in a shaded area.<BR><BR>The desired performance of the methodology or treatment submitted would ideally be equal to or better than the current combat doctrine of hand cleaning.  Examples of performance can be found in physical performance requirements of MIL-B-44053A (Body armor, Fragmentation Protective Vest, Ground Troops).  Due to the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of the desired capabilities, the Army will consider any and all methodologies that can clean and sanitize Cordura material without affecting the Corduras camouflage pattern (no color loss), shrinkage, coatings, and fire retardant ability.  Additionally, the method shall not impact other materials of the item.<BR> <BR>Item is defined as a Warfighters garment or piece of load carriage equipment.  Damage is defined as an item that has visually shrunk, warped, lost color, or has failed to meet physical property requirements set forth in various military specifications to the extent that the item is unserviceable.  Traditional test methods such as Vertical Flame Test ASTM D6413, Abrasion Test ASTM D3884, and hydrostatic resistance ASTM D751 will be utilized to verify measured performance.  Other test methods, depending on the type and characteristics of materials or technologies submitted, will be considered. <BR><BR>For developmental products, estimate the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) for both the developmental material and the fabrication method.  All interested firms, regardless of size, are encouraged to respond to this RFI by submitting technology description, product literature, product potential, technical specifications, pertinent test data (including pictures and videos), cost, material safety data sheets (if applicable), product availability, product uses (past, present or future) and comments on performance.  Responders are encouraged to provide an initial response NLT 21st May 2009.  Proprietary information will not be disclosed outside the US Government.  The Government will not pay for information and materials received in response to this RFI and is in no way obligated by the information received.  Inclusion in this RFI or the resulting database does not constitute Government approval for any product. <BR><BR>Technical POC for this matter is:<BR><BR> Mr. Francisco J.

The ballistic vest is a particularly time intensive item to clean, and requires the removal of ballistic inserts prior to hand washing.  Badly soiled areas may be scrubbed with a soft bristled brush and are to be rinsed thoroughly in clean, lukewarm water until suds are completely gone.  Items are then dried indoors or in shaded area.  The use of chlorine bleach, yellow soap, cleaning fluids or solvents (perc) is not authorized.  Drying in direct sunlight, near direct heat or near an open flame will lead to degradation.  Standard heat in commercial and home laundering will also lead to garment shrinkage.<BR><BR>The desired performance of the methodology or treatment submitted would ideally be equal to or better than the current combat doctrine of hand cleaning.

The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed Price contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 

1) Technical Capability
2) Past Performance
3) Total Price Proposed

In determining the best value to the Government, the Technical Capability and Past Performance Evaluation Criteria, when combined, are more important than the total price.  Contractors are cautioned that the award may not necessarily be made to the contractor with lowest cost.  The Government reserves the right to evaluate proposals and make award without conducting discussions, but reserves the right to conduct discussions with one or more offerors and request revised proposals.  Although price is not the determining factor for award, it may become the determining factor for award if two or more offers, after technical evaluations are completed, are determined to be technically equal.

Factor I - Technical Capability

a.  Contract Requirements - Proposals will be evaluated on the offerors ability to provide all of the contract requirements relating to lodging, meeting space, and food and beverage requirements. Proposals must address the offerors’ ability to comply with the Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act of 1990 and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) as it relates to lodging and meeting spaces.

Site Visits will be conducted to evaluate the accommodations, conference rooms, location and amenities.

b.  Location - Proposals will be evaluated on the ability of the offeror to provide a facility located in downtown Washington, D.C. within walking distance of NLRB headquarters at 1099 14th Street, NW and metro stations.

c.  Availability of Dates - Proposals will be evaluated on the ability of the offeror to provide the required services on the dates requested.

d.  Other Considerations; transportation to major airports, availability and cost of on-site guest parking and diversified, adequate and reasonable food services must be available on-site and within walking distance.

e.  Availability of Daily/Overnight self-pay parking on Days One through Day Five for up to 40 people.

Factor II - Past Performance

The offeror must provide references for at least three (3) federal government contracts for similar work performed within the past three (3) years. The offeror will be evaluated based on customer satisfaction and timeliness on requirements similar size and scope.  The contact information for each reference shall include the following: 

Contract type
Contract number
Contract Value
Agency/Company Name
Agency/Company point of contact telephone number
Duration of Contract
Type of services provided (brief description)
List any problems encountered on each contract and the contractor’s corrective actions

In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.

Factor III – Price

Proposed prices will be compared to proposed cost of same or similar services in order to determine if the proposed prices are realistic, fair and reasonable.  Although price is not the determining factor for award, it may become the determining factor for award if two or more offers, after technical evaluations are completed, are determined to be technically equal.

(a) Definition.—“Site of the work”— 

(1) Means-- 

(i) The primary site of the work. The physical place or places where the construction called for in the contract will remain when work on it is completed; and 

(ii) The secondary site of the work, if any. Any other site where a significant portion of the building or work is constructed, provided that such site is— 

(A) Located in the United States; and 

(B) Established specifically for the performance of the contract or project; 

(2) Except as provided in paragraph (3) of this definition, includes any fabrication plants, mobile factories, batch plants, borrow pits, job headquarters, tool yards, etc., provided— 

(i) They are dedicated exclusively, or nearly so, to performance of the contract or project; and 

(ii) They are adjacent or virtually adjacent to the “primary site of the work” as defined in paragraph (a)(1)(i), or the “secondary site of the work” as defined in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this definition; 

(3) Does not include permanent home offices, branch plant establishments, fabrication plants, or tool yards of a Contractor or subcontractor whose locations and continuance in operation are determined wholly without regard to a particular Federal contract or project. In addition, fabrication plants, batch plants, borrow pits, job headquarters, yards, etc., of a commercial or material supplier which are established by a supplier of materials for the project before opening of bids and not on the Project site, are not included in the “site of the work.” Such permanent, previously established facilities are not a part of the “site of the work” even if the operations for a period of time may be dedicated exclusively or nearly so, to the performance of a contract. 

(b) (1) All laborers and mechanics employed or working upon the site of the work will be paid unconditionally and not less often than once a week, and without subsequent deduction or rebate on any account (except such payroll deductions as are permitted by regulations issued by the Secretary of Labor under the Copeland Act (29 CFR Part 3)), the full amount of wages and bona fide fringe benefits (or 
cash equivalents thereof) due at time of payment computed at rates not less than those contained in the wage determination of the Secretary of Labor which is attached hereto and made a part hereof, or as may be incorporated for a secondary site of the work, regardless of any contractual relationship which may be alleged to exist between the Contractor and such laborers and mechanics. Any wage determination incorporated for a secondary site of the work shall be effective from the first day on which work under the contract was performed at that site and shall be incorporated without any adjustment in contract price or estimated cost. Laborers employed by the construction Contractor or construction subcontractor 
that are transporting portions of the building or work between the secondary site of the work and the primary site of the work shall be paid in accordance with the wage determination applicable to the primary site of the work. 

(2) Contributions made or costs reasonably anticipated for bona fide fringe benefits under section 1(b)(2) of the Davis-Bacon Act on behalf of laborers or mechanics are considered wages paid to such laborers or mechanics, subject to the provisions of paragraph (e) of this clause; also, regular contributions made or 
costs incurred for more than a weekly period (but not less often than quarterly) under plans, funds, or programs which cover the particular weekly period, are deemed to be constructively made or incurred during such period. 

(3) Such laborers and mechanics shall be paid not less than the appropriate wage rate and fringe benefits in the wage determination for the classification of work actually performed, without regard to skill, except as provided in the clause entitled Apprentices and Trainees. Laborers or mechanics performing work in 
more than one classification may be compensated at the rate specified for each classification for the time actually worked therein; provided, that the employer’s payroll records accurately set forth the time spent in each classification in which work is performed. 

(4) The wage determination (including any additional classifications and wage rates conformed under paragraph (c) of this clause) and the Davis-Bacon poster (WH-1321) shall be posted at all times by the Contractor and its subcontractors at the site of the work in a prominent and accessible place where it can be easily seen by the workers. 

(c) (1) The Contracting Officer shall require that any class of laborers or mechanics which is not listed in the wage determination and which is to be employed under the contract shall be classified in conformance with the wage determination. The Contracting Officer shall approve an additional classification and wage rate and fringe benefits therefore only when all the following criteria have been met: 

(i) The work to be performed by the classification requested is not performed by a classification in the wage determination. 

(ii) The classification is utilized in the area by the construction industry. 

(iii) The proposed wage rate, including any bona fide fringe benefits, bears a reasonable relationship to the wage rates contained in the wage determination. 

(2) If the Contractor and the laborers and mechanics to be employed in the classification (if known), or their representatives, and the Contracting Officer agree on the classification and wage rate (including the amount designated for fringe benefits, where appropriate), a report of the action taken shall be sent by 
the Contracting Officer to the Administrator of the: 

Wage and Hour Division 
Employment Standards Administration 
U.S. Department of Labor 
Washington, DC 20210 

The Administrator or an authorized representative will approve, modify, or disapprove every additional classification action within 30 days of receipt and so advise the Contracting Officer or will notify the Contracting Officer within the 30-day period that additional time is necessary. 

(3) In the event the Contractor, the laborers or mechanics to be employed in the classification, or their representatives, and the Contracting Officer do not agree on the proposed classification and wage rate (including the amount designated for fringe benefits, where appropriate), the Contracting Officer shall refer the questions, including the views of all interested parties and the recommendation of the Contracting Officer, to the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division for determination. The Administrator, or an authorized representative, will issue a determination within 30 days of receipt and so advise the Contracting Officer or will notify the Contracting Officer within the 30-day period that additional time is necessary. 

(4) The wage rate (including fringe benefits, where appropriate) determined pursuant to subparagraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this clause shall be paid to all workers performing work in the classification under this contract from the first day on which work is performed in the classification. 

(d) Whenever the minimum wage rate prescribed in the contract for a class of laborers or mechanics includes a fringe benefit which is not expressed as an hourly rate, the Contractor shall either pay the benefit as stated in the wage determination or shall pay another bona fide fringe benefit or an hourly cash equivalent thereof. 

(e) If the Contractor does not make payments to a trustee or other third person, the Contractor may consider as part of the wages of any laborer or mechanic the amount of any costs reasonably anticipated in providing bona fide fringe benefits under a plan or program; provided, That the Secretary of Labor has found, upon the written request of the Contractor, that the applicable standards of the Davis-Bacon Act have been met. The Secretary of Labor may require the Contractor to set aside in a separate account assets for the meeting of obligations under the plan or program.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 

Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Governments reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business days written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of Payment paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractors CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757. (End of clause) Alternate I (Oct 2008). When a time-and-materials or labor-hour contract is contemplated, substitute the following paragraphs (a), (e), (i) and (l) for those in the basic clause. (a) Inspection/Acceptance. (1) The Government has the right to inspect and test all materials furnished and services performed under this contract, to the extent practicable at all places and times, including the period of performance, and in any event before acceptance. The Government may also inspect the plant or plants of the Contractor or any subcontractor engaged in contract performance. The Government will perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. (2) If the Government performs inspection or tests on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish and shall require subcontractors to furnish all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. (3) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Government will accept or reject services and materials at the place of delivery as promptly as practicable after delivery, and they will be presumed accepted 60 days after the date of delivery, unless accepted earlier. (4) At any time during contract performance, but not later than 6 months (or such other time as may be specified in the contract) after acceptance of the services or materials last delivered under this contract, the Government may require the Contractor to replace or correct services or materials that at time of delivery failed to meet contract requirements. Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under paragraph (i) of this clause, but the hourly rate for labor hours incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified below, the portion of the hourly rate attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance materials and services required to be replaced or corrected without disclosing the former requirement for replacement or correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken. [Insert portion of labor rate attributable to profit.] (5)(i) If the Contractor fails to proceed with reasonable promptness to perform required replacement or correction, and if the replacement or correction can be performed within the ceiling price (or the ceiling price as increased by the Government), the Government may (A) By contract or otherwise, perform the replacement or correction, charge to the Contractor any increased cost, or deduct such increased cost from any amounts paid or due under this contract; or (B) Terminate this contract for cause. (ii) Failure to agree to the amount of increased cost to be charged to the Contractor shall be a dispute under the Disputes clause of the contract. (6) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) above, the Government may at any time require the Contractor to remedy by correction or replacement, without cost to the Government, any failure by the Contractor to comply with the requirements of this contract, if the failure is due to (i) Fraud, lack of good faith, or willful misconduct on the part of the Contractor's managerial personnel; or (ii) The conduct of one or more of the Contractors employees selected or retained by the Contractor after any of the Contractors managerial personnel has reasonable grounds to believe that the employee is habitually careless or unqualified. (7) This clause applies in the same manner and to the same extent to corrected or replacement materials or services as to materials and services originally delivered under this contract. (8) The Contractor has no obligation or liability under this contract to correct or replace materials and services that at time of delivery do not meet contract requirements, except as provided in this clause or as may be otherwise specified in the contract. (9) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Contractor's obligation to correct or replace Government-furnished property shall be governed by the clause pertaining to Government property. (e) Definitions. (1) The clause at FAR 52.202-1, Definitions, is incorporated herein by reference. As used in this clause (i) Direct materials means those materials that enter directly into the end product, or that are used or consumed directly in connection with the furnishing of the end product or service.(ii) Hourly rate means the rate(s) prescribed in the contract for payment for labor that meets the labor category qualifications of a labor category specified in the contract that are (A) Performed by the contractor; (B) Performed by the subcontractors; or (C) Transferred between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the contractor under a common control. (iii) Materials means (A) Direct materials, including supplies transferred between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the contractor under a common control; (B) Subcontracts for supplies and incidental services for which there is not a labor category specified in the contract; (C) Other direct costs (e.g., incidental services for which there is not a labor category specified in the contract, travel, computer usage charges, etc.); (D) The following subcontracts for services which are specifically excluded from the hourly rate: [Insert any subcontracts for services to be excluded from the hourly rates prescribed in the schedule.]; and (E) Indirect costs specifically provided for in this clause. (iv) Subcontract means any contract, as defined in FAR Subpart 2.1, entered into with a subcontractor to furnish supplies or services for performance of the prime contract or a subcontract including transfers between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of a contractor or subcontractor. It includes, but is not limited to, purchase orders, and changes and modifications to purchase orders. (i) Payments. (1) Services accepted. Payment shall be made for services accepted by the Government that have been delivered to the delivery destination(s) set forth in this contract. The Government will pay the Contractor as follows upon the submission of commercial invoices approved by the Contracting Officer: (i) Hourly rate. (A) The amounts shall be computed by multiplying the appropriate hourly rates prescribed in the contract by the number of direct labor hours performed. Fractional parts of an hour shall be payable on a prorated basis. (B) The rates shall be paid for all labor performed on the contract that meets the labor qualifications specified in the contract. Labor hours incurred to perform tasks for which labor qualifications were specified in the contract will not be paid to the extent the work is performed by individuals that do not meet the qualifications specified in the contract, unless specifically authorized by the Contracting Officer. (C) Invoices may be submitted once each month (or at more frequent intervals, if approved by the Contracting Officer) to the Contracting Officer or the authorized representative. (D) When requested by the Contracting Officer or the authorized representative, the Contractor shall substantiate invoices (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule) by evidence of actual payment, individual daily job timecards, records that verify the employees meet the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract, or other substantiation specified in the contract. (E) Unless the Schedule prescribes otherwise, the hourly rates in the Schedule shall not be varied by virtue of the Contractor having performed work on an overtime basis. (1) If no overtime rates are provided in the Schedule and the Contracting Officer approves overtime work in advance, overtime rates shall be negotiated. 2) Failure to agree upon these overtime rates shall be treated as a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract. (3) If the Schedule provides rates for overtime, the premium portion of those rates will be reimbursable only to the extent the overtime is approved by the Contracting Officer. (ii) Materials. (A) If the Contractor furnishes materials that meet the definition of a commercial item at FAR 2.101, the price to be paid for such materials shall be the contractor's established catalog or market price, adjusted to reflect the (1) Quantities being acquired; and (2) Any modifications necessary because of contract requirements.(B) Except as provided for in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(A) and (D)(2) of this clause, the Government will reimburse the Contractor the actual cost of materials (less any rebates, refunds, or discounts received by the contractor that are identifiable to the contract) provided the Contractor      (1) Has made payments for materials in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice; or (2) Makes these payments within 30 days of the submission of the Contractors payment request to the Government and such payment is in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice. (C) To the extent able, the Contractor shall (1) Obtain materials at the most advantageous prices available with due regard to securing prompt delivery of satisfactory materials; and 2) Give credit to the Government for cash and trade discounts, rebates, scrap, commissions, and other amounts that are identifiable to the contract. (D) Other Costs. Unless listed below, other direct and indirect costs will not be reimbursed. 1) Other Direct Costs. The Government will reimburse the Contractor on the basis of actual cost for the following, provided such costs comply with the requirements in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(B) of this clause: [Insert each element of other direct costs (e.g., travel, computer usage charges, etc. Insert None if no reimbursement for other direct costs will be provided. If this is an indefinite delivery contract, the Contracting Officer may insert Each order must list separately the elements of other direct charge(s) for that order or, if no reimbursement for other direct costs will be provided, insert None.] (2) Indirect Costs (Material Handling, Subcontract Administration, etc.). The Government will reimburse the Contractor for indirect costs on a pro-rata basis over the period of contract performance at the following fixed price: [Insert a fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule. Insert $0 if no fixed price reimbursement for indirect costs will be provided. (If this is an indefinite delivery contract, the Contracting Officer may insert Each order must list separately the fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule or, if no reimbursement for indirect costs, insert None).] 2) Total cost. It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during the performance of this contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the then stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performance of this contract, the Government has reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price, the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the contract. (3) Ceiling price. The Government will not be obligated to pay the Contractor any amount in excess of the ceiling price in the Schedule, and the Contractor shall not be obligated to continue performance if to do so would exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule, unless and until the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor in writing that the ceiling price has been increased and specifies in the notice a revised ceiling that shall constitute the ceiling price for performance under this contract. When and to the extent that the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule has been increased, any hours expended and material costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the ceiling price before the increase shall be allowable to the same extent as if the hours expended and material costs had been incurred after the increase in the ceiling price. (4) Access to records. At any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer (or authorized representative) will have access to the following (access shall be limited to the listing below unless otherwise agreed to by the Contractor and the Contracting Officer): (i) Records that verify that the employees whose time has been included in any invoice meet the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract; (ii) For labor hours (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule), when timecards are required as substantiation for payment (A) The original timecards (paper-based or electronic); (B) The Contractors timekeeping procedures; (C) Contractor records that show the distribution of labor between jobs or contracts; and (D) Employees whose time has been included in any invoice for the purpose of verifying that these employees have worked the hours shown on the invoices. (iii) For material and subcontract costs that are reimbursed on the basis of actual cost (A) Any invoices or subcontract agreements substantiating material costs; and (B) Any documents supporting payment of those invoices. (5) Overpayments/Underpayments. Each payment previously made shall be subject to reduction to the extent of amounts, on preceding invoices, that are found by the Contracting Officer not to have been properly payable and shall also be subject to reduction for overpayments or to increase for underpayments. The Contractor shall promptly pay any such reduction within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The Government within 30 days will pay any such increases, unless the parties agree otherwise. The Contractors payment will be made by check. If the Contractor becomes aware of a duplicate invoice payment or that the Government has otherwise overpaid on an invoice payment, the Contractor shall (i) Remit the overpayment amount to the payment office cited in the contract along with a description of the overpayment including the (A) Circumstances of the overpayment (e.g., duplicate payment, erroneous payment, liquidation errors, date(s) of overpayment); (B) Affected contract number and delivery order number, if applicable; (C) Affected contract line item or subline item, if applicable; and (D) Contractor point of contact. (ii) Provide a copy of the remittance and supporting documentation to the Contracting Officer. (6)(i) All amounts that become payable by the Contractor to the Government under this contract shall bear simple interest from the date due until paid unless paid within 30 days of becoming due. The interest rate shall be the interest rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury, as provided in section 611 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-563), which is applicable to the period in which the amount becomes due, and then at the rate applicable for each six month period as established by the Secretary until the amount is paid. (ii) The Government may issue a demand for payment to the Contractor upon finding a debt is due under the contract. (iii) Final Decisions. The Contracting Officer will issue a final decision as required by 33.211 if (A) The Contracting Officer and the Contractor are unable to reach agreement on the existence or amount of a debt in a timely manner; (B) The Contractor fails to liquidate a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer within the timeline specified in the demand for payment unless the amounts were not repaid because the Contractor has requested an installment payment agreement; or (C) The Contractor requests a deferment of collection on a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer (see FAR 32.607-2). (iv) If a demand for payment was previously issued for the debt, the demand for payment included in the final decision shall identify the same due date as the original demand for payment. (v) Amounts shall be due at the earliest of the following dates: (A) The date fixed under this contract. (B) The date of the first written demand for payment, including any demand for payment resulting from a default termination. (vi) The interest charge shall be computed for the actual number of calendar days involved beginning on the due date and ending on (A) The date on which the designated office receives payment from the Contractor; (B) The date of issuance of a Government check to the Contractor from which an amount otherwise payable has been withheld as a credit against the contract debt; or (C) The date on which an amount withheld and applied to the contract debt would otherwise have become payable to the Contractor. (vii) The interest charge made under this clause may be reduced under the procedures prescribed in 32.608-2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation in effect on the date of this contract. (viii) Upon receipt and approval of the invoice designated by the Contractor as the completion invoice and supporting documentation, and upon compliance by the Contractor with all terms of this contract, any outstanding balances will be paid within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The completion invoice, and supporting documentation, shall be submitted by the Contractor as promptly as practicable following completion of the work under this contract, but in no event later than 1 year (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may approve in writing) from the date of completion. (7) Release of claims. The Contractor, and each assignee under an assignment entered into under this contract and in effect at the time of final payment under this contract, shall execute and deliver, at the time of and as a condition precedent to final payment under this contract, a release discharging the Government, its officers, agents, and employees of and from all liabilities, obligations, and claims arising out of or under this contract, subject only to the following exceptions. (i) Specified claims in stated amounts, or in estimated amounts if the amounts are not susceptible to exact statement by the Contractor. (ii) Claims, together with reasonable incidental expenses, based upon the liabilities of the Contractor to third parties arising out of performing this contract, that are not known to the Contractor on the date of the execution of the release, and of which the Contractor gives notice in writing to the Contracting Officer not more than 6 years after the date of the release or the date of any notice to the Contractor that the Government is prepared to make final payment, whichever is earlier. (iii) Claims for reimbursement of costs (other than expenses of the Contractor by reason of its indemnification of the Government against patent liability), including reasonable incidental expenses, incurred by the Contractor under the terms of this contract relating to patents. (8) Prompt payment. The Government will make payment in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3903) and prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315. (9) Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT). If the Government makes payment by EFT, see 52.212-5(b) for the appropriate EFT clause. (10) Discount. In connection with any discount offered for early payment, time shall be computed from the date of the invoice. For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date that appears on the payment check or the specified payment date if an electronic funds transfer payment is made. (l) Termination for the Governments convenience. The Government reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for its sole convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount for direct labor hours (as defined in the Schedule of the contract) determined by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended before the effective date of termination by the hourly rate(s) in the contract, less any hourly rate payments already made to the Contractor plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system that have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractors records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred that reasonably could have been avoided. VAAR 852.273-75 Security Requirements for Unclassified Information Technology Resources (Interim October 2008)   (a) The contractor and their personnel shall be subject to the same Federal laws, regulations, standards and VA policies as VA personnel, regarding information and information system security.

8.  STATEMENT OF WORK

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is  responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction.  It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA’s Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.

INTRODUCTION

To fulfill its mandate to effectively respond to disasters worldwide, OFDA has established seven permanent regional offices in the following locations:  Budapest, Hungary; San Jose, Costa Rica; Nairobi, Kenya; Dakar, Senegal; Kathmandu, Nepal; Pretoria, South Africa; and Bangkok, Thailand.  The sub regional offices are in Almaty, Kazakhstan and the Middle East.

The regional offices are headed by Principal Regional Advisors (PRAs) who report to the Disaster Response Team Leader in Washington. PRAs serve as the regional team leader for all response, preparedness and disaster risk reduction activities. They primarily serve as the key interlocutor with embassies and missions in the event of a disaster but may also serve as the Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) leader if needed.  They are principally responsible for managing the regional offices, monitoring all grants on humanitarian assistance program implementation, overseeing the sub-regional offices, as appropriate, supervising the office staff, and developing, in consultation with their respective Washington-based Regional Coordinators , the multi-year non-response program strategies for the their respective regions.  The PRAs coordinate with OFDA/Washington on disaster response activities, determine program priorities, and identify and formulate disaster preparedness, mitigation and training programs for their respective regions.  The Regional Advisors (RAs) reporting to the PRAs ensure that OFDA’s objectives for disaster response and assistance, strategic reporting and analysis are met. The RAs are responsible for monitoring and reporting on OFDA-funded programs and activities, and formulating disaster response, preparedness, mitigation and training programs for the region.

OBJECTIVE

OFDA requires the services of multiple Regional Advisors (RAs) in the following locations: Almaty, Kazakhstan; the Middle East; San Jose, Costa Rica; Nairobi, Kenya; Dakar, Senegal; Pretoria, South Africa; and Bangkok, Thailand (to cover the East Asia-Pacific and South Asia regions).

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

This Regional Advisor position requires an individual who is able to travel outside of the country where they are based, on short notice for two to three weeks at a time, or longer, on occasion. The incumbent will serve as the primary contact and liaison for on-going disaster activities related to disaster response, preparedness, mitigation and training programs.  The incumbent will work to increase the capability of host governments, international organizations (IOs), and non governmental organizations (NGOs) to respond and prepare for disasters in the affected region. The Regional Advisor will be responsible for disaster analysis, program monitoring, overseeing NGO partner implementation, reporting to OFDA Washington, and liaising with USAID Missions and U.S. Embassies. 

A) Disaster Response - Working directly under the guidance and supervision of the respective Principal Regional Advisor, the incumbent will:

•	Travel to the scene of a disaster or potential disaster and assist in initial assessments of damages and needs; determine appropriate relief assistance and emergency interventions, in consultation with OFDA/Washington and/or the Principal Regional Advisor; and provide timely reporting cables and other written analysis of these events;
•	Coordinate and liaise with representatives of host governments, donor governments, IOs, NGOs, U.S. Embassies, and USAID Missions to facilitate cooperation and coordination in disaster response activities;
•	Monitor DCHA/OFDA-funded activities and report in accordance with OFDA guidelines, policies, and requirements;
•	Become certified and serve as a Cognizant Technical Officer (CTO) for grants, cooperative agreements and contracts;

•	Maintain regular communications with the regional (and/or sub-regional) office in their area of responsibility and with OFDA/Washington;
•	Prepare specific requested field information and subject reports, as required by OFDA/Washington.
	
B) Disaster Preparedness - Working closely with OFDA/Washington and drawing on the skills and technical expertise within the office and available through inter- and intra-agency agreements, the incumbent will assist representatives of host government organizations, IOs, and NGOs in the development of strong emergency and disaster preparedness/mitigation programs.

Specifically, the incumbent, in collaboration with OFDA regional/sub-regional team colleagues, will:

•	Assist with the design, development, and implementation of strategies and integrated disaster assistance and response for OFDA, local governments, and other donors/organizations as appropriate;
•	Advise regional officials, including host country authorities and other USAID and/or U.S. Embassy officials on OFDA’s efforts in disaster response and management;
•	Provide support for other OFDA initiatives in the assigned region as identified by the incumbent’s respective Regional Office and/or sub-regional team.  Support may include but is not limited to assessment/evaluation visits, project design exercises and hazards/vulnerability/risk analysis;
•	Coordinate with other agencies/organizations to identify critical disaster concerns affecting the region and countries and develop projects/activities for addressing these;
•	Work with representatives of local and regional institutions and private/public sector organizations to incorporate preparedness and mitigation into appropriate programs;
•	Prepare regular strategic and analytical reports on current or anticipated emergencies, as well as comprehensive preparedness documentation on assigned countries.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. “MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.”

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer’s liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled “Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.”  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor’s invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual’s behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

<p>52.212-2 EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD USING LOWEST PRICE TECHNICALLY ACCEPTABLE (LPTA) PROCEDURES</p>
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>a. Basis for Contract Award:<br />This acquisition will utilize Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source selection procedures in accordance with FAR 15.101-2, as supplemented. Technical tradeoffs will not be made and no additional credit will be given for exceeding acceptability. Award will be made to the acceptable offeror with the lowest evaluated cost or price, which is deemed responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation and whose proposal conforms to the solicitation requirements. The solicitation requirements include all stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information required by Section L of this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined necessary by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>b. Number of Contracts to be Awarded:<br />The Government intends to select one contractor for the Louden Requirements. However, the Government reserves the right to award no contract at all, depending on the quality of the proposals and prices submitted and the availability of funds.</p>
<p>c. Rejection of Unrealistic Offers:<br />The Government may reject any proposal that is evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of program commitments, including contract terms and conditions, or unrealistically high or low in cost/price when compared to Government estimates, such that the proposal is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the program.</p>
<p>d. Correction Potential of Proposals:<br />The Government will consider, throughout the evaluation, the "correction potential" of any proposal uncertainty. The judgment of such "correction potential" is within the sole discretion of the Government. If an aspect of an offeror's proposal not meeting the Government's requirements is not considered correctable, the offeror may be eliminated from the competitive range.</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS</p>
<p>a. List factors and Subfactors:<br />The Government will evaluate for acceptability the factors described below:</p>
<p>Factor 1- Technical Proposal <br />Factor 2- Cost/Price <br />Factor 3-Past Performance</p>
<p>b. Evaluation Methodology:<br />Technical acceptability will be evaluated on all offers. Only those offerors determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for award. Then, price will be evaluated and the proposals will be listed from lowest to highest price based on the total evaluated price.</p>
<p>Then, the offerors' past performance will be evaluated starting with the lowest price technically acceptable offer. Only those offerors determined to have an acceptable past performance rating, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for award. Past performance evaluations will cease when the first two technically acceptable proposals receive an acceptable past performance rating for price comparison purposes.</p>
<p>Award will be made to the lowest evaluated priced proposal meeting the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors.</p>
<p>c. Technical Factor:<br />By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all solicitation technical requirements, to include the Government's Required Delivery Schedule, and will be determined technically acceptable. If the offeror is unable to meet the Government's Required Delivery Schedule, the offeror may set forth the delivery schedule the offeror is prepared to meet. However, should the offeror's proposed delivery schedule not meet the Required Delievery Schedule and should the Government determine such proposed delivery schedule to be unacceptable, the offeror will be determined UNACCEPTABLE. If the offeror's proposed delivery is determined acceptable, the solicitation will be amended and each offeror will be afforded an opportunity to revise their proposals. If the offeror does not propose a different delivery schedule, the Government's Required Delivery Schedule shall apply. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable.</p>
<p>Each proposal will receive one of the ratings described below for Factor 1 - Technical Proposal</p>
<p>Acceptable - The proposal meets specified minimum requirements necessary for acceptable contract performance.</p>
<p>Unacceptable - The proposal fails to meet specified minimum requirements necessary for contract performance. Proposals with an unacceptable rating are not awardable.</p>
<p>d. Cost/Price Factor:</p>
<p>Cost/Price Evaluation: The offeror's cost/price proposal will be evaluated for award purposes by adding the total price for basic requirements (basic award).</p>
<p>Total Evaluated Price: Price analysis will be performed to determine the reasonableness of the offeror's price proposal. Reasonableness will be based on the total evaluated price. The total evaluated price will be calculated as the sum of the Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) unit/extended prices plus other associated factors such as transportation costs if appropriate.</p>
<p>Unrealistically Low Costs or Prices: Unrealistically low proposed costs or prices, initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or the offeror has made an unrealistic proposal.</p>
<p>Unbalanced Pricing: Offerors are cautioned against submitting an offer that contains unbalance pricing. Unbalanced pricing may increase performance risk and could result in payment of unreasonably high prices. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly over or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. The Government shall analyze offers to determine whether they are unbalanced with respect to separately priced line items or subline items. Offers that are determined to be unbalanced may be rejected if the contracting officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.</p>
<p>e. Past Performance Factor:<br />Past performance information may be gathered from both Government (such as RYG, MOCAS, CPARS) and commercial sources. Offerors will not be penalized if no past performance information is available. Past performance will either be satisfactory, neutral, or unsatisfactory where satisfactory equals a neutral or determination of responsibility, and unsatisfactory equals a determination of non-responsibility. Any unsatisfactory rating given to a small business will be referred to the Small Business Administration pursuant to FAR 15.101-2(b) and 19.6 for resolution.</p>
<p>f. Discussions:<br />It is the Government's intent to award without discussions, therefore, it is imperative that offerors submit their best terms initially. However, if during the evaluation period, it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government to hold discussions, offeror responses to Evaluation Notices (ENs), and the Final Proposal Revisions (FPRs) will be considered in making the source selection decision.<br /><br />PRE-AWARD SURVEY<br /><br />The Government may conduct a pre-award survey (PAS) as part of this source selection. Results of the PAS (if conducted) will be evaluated to determine each offerors' capability to meet the requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>PLANT VISITS<br /><br />In the event discussions are necessary, plant visits may be conducted during the evaluation phase to develop knowledge for judging the potential for correction of deficiencies. <br /><br />SOLICITATION REQUIREMENTS, TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br /><br />Offerors are required to meet all solicitation requirements, such as terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors or sub-factors. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being ineligible for award.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. section 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p>52.212-2 EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD USING LOWEST PRICE TECHNICALLY ACCEPTABLE (LPTA) PROCEDURES</p>
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>a. Basis for Contract Award:<br />This acquisition will utilize Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source selection procedures in accordance with FAR 15.101-2, as supplemented. Technical tradeoffs will not be made and no additional credit will be given for exceeding acceptability. Award will be made to the acceptable offeror with the lowest evaluated cost or price, which is deemed responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation and whose proposal conforms to the solicitation requirements. The solicitation requirements include all stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information required by Section L of this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined necessary by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>b. Number of Contracts to be Awarded:<br />The Government intends to select one contractor for the Louden Requirements. However, the Government reserves the right to award no contract at all, depending on the quality of the proposals and prices submitted and the availability of funds.</p>
<p>c. Rejection of Unrealistic Offers:<br />The Government may reject any proposal that is evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of program commitments, including contract terms and conditions, or unrealistically high or low in cost/price when compared to Government estimates, such that the proposal is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the program.</p>
<p>d. Correction Potential of Proposals:<br />The Government will consider, throughout the evaluation, the "correction potential" of any proposal uncertainty. The judgment of such "correction potential" is within the sole discretion of the Government. If an aspect of an offeror's proposal not meeting the Government's requirements is not considered correctable, the offeror may be eliminated from the competitive range.</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS</p>
<p>a. List factors and Subfactors:<br />The Government will evaluate for acceptability the factors described below:</p>
<p>Factor 1- Technical Proposal <br />Factor 2- Cost/Price <br />Factor 3-Past Performance</p>
<p>b. Evaluation Methodology:<br />Technical acceptability will be evaluated on all offers. Only those offerors determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for award. Then, price will be evaluated and the proposals will be listed from lowest to highest price based on the total evaluated price.</p>
<p>Then, the offerors' past performance will be evaluated starting with the lowest price technically acceptable offer. Only those offerors determined to have an acceptable past performance rating, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for award. Past performance evaluations will cease when the first two technically acceptable proposals receive an acceptable past performance rating for price comparison purposes.</p>
<p>Award will be made to the lowest evaluated priced proposal meeting the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors.</p>
<p>c. Technical Factor:<br />By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all solicitation technical requirements, to include the Government's Required Delivery Schedule, and will be determined technically acceptable. If the offeror is unable to meet the Government's Required Delivery Schedule, the offeror may set forth the delivery schedule the offeror is prepared to meet. However, should the offeror's proposed delivery schedule not meet the Required Delievery Schedule and should the Government determine such proposed delivery schedule to be unacceptable, the offeror will be determined UNACCEPTABLE. If the offeror's proposed delivery is determined acceptable, the solicitation will be amended and each offeror will be afforded an opportunity to revise their proposals. If the offeror does not propose a different delivery schedule, the Government's Required Delivery Schedule shall apply. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable.</p>
<p>Each proposal will receive one of the ratings described below for Factor 1 - Technical Proposal</p>
<p>Acceptable - The proposal meets specified minimum requirements necessary for acceptable contract performance.</p>
<p>Unacceptable - The proposal fails to meet specified minimum requirements necessary for contract performance. Proposals with an unacceptable rating are not awardable.</p>
<p>d. Cost/Price Factor:</p>
<p>Cost/Price Evaluation: The offeror's cost/price proposal will be evaluated for award purposes by adding the total price for basic requirements (basic award).</p>
<p>Total Evaluated Price: Price analysis will be performed to determine the reasonableness of the offeror's price proposal. Reasonableness will be based on the total evaluated price. The total evaluated price will be calculated as the sum of the Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) unit/extended prices plus other associated factors such as transportation costs if appropriate.</p>
<p>Unrealistically Low Costs or Prices: Unrealistically low proposed costs or prices, initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or the offeror has made an unrealistic proposal.</p>
<p>Unbalanced Pricing: Offerors are cautioned against submitting an offer that contains unbalance pricing. Unbalanced pricing may increase performance risk and could result in payment of unreasonably high prices. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly over or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. The Government shall analyze offers to determine whether they are unbalanced with respect to separately priced line items or subline items. Offers that are determined to be unbalanced may be rejected if the contracting officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.</p>
<p>e. Past Performance Factor:<br />Past performance information may be gathered from both Government (such as RYG, MOCAS, CPARS) and commercial sources. Offerors will not be penalized if no past performance information is available. Past performance will either be satisfactory, neutral, or unsatisfactory where satisfactory equals a neutral or determination of responsibility, and unsatisfactory equals a determination of non-responsibility. Any unsatisfactory rating given to a small business will be referred to the Small Business Administration pursuant to FAR 15.101-2(b) and 19.6 for resolution.</p>
<p>f. Discussions:<br />It is the Government's intent to award without discussions, therefore, it is imperative that offerors submit their best terms initially. However, if during the evaluation period, it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government to hold discussions, offeror responses to Evaluation Notices (ENs), and the Final Proposal Revisions (FPRs) will be considered in making the source selection decision.<br /><br />PRE-AWARD SURVEY<br /><br />The Government may conduct a pre-award survey (PAS) as part of this source selection. Results of the PAS (if conducted) will be evaluated to determine each offerors' capability to meet the requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>PLANT VISITS<br /><br />In the event discussions are necessary, plant visits may be conducted during the evaluation phase to develop knowledge for judging the potential for correction of deficiencies. <br /><br />SOLICITATION REQUIREMENTS, TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br /><br />Offerors are required to meet all solicitation requirements, such as terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors or sub-factors. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being ineligible for award. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale.</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. section 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. section 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

1) Technical Capability
2) Past Performance
3) Total Price Proposed

In determining the best value to the Government, the Technical Capability and Past Performance Evaluation Criteria, when combined, are more important than the total price.  Contractors are cautioned that the award may not necessarily be made to the contractor with lowest cost.  The Government reserves the right to evaluate proposals and make award without conducting discussions, but reserves the right to conduct discussions with one or more offerors and request revised proposals.  Although price is not the determining factor for award, it may become the determining factor for award if two or more offers, after technical evaluations are completed, are determined to be technically equal.

a. Contract Requirements - Proposals will be evaluated on the offerors ability to provide all of the contract requirements relating to lodging, meeting space, and food and beverage requirements. Proposals must address the offerors’ ability to comply with the Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act of 1990 and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) as it relates to lodging and meeting spaces.

Site Visits will be conducted to evaluate the accommodations, conference rooms, location and amenities.

b. Location - Proposals will be evaluated on the ability of the offeror to provide a facility located in downtown Washington, D.C.

c. Availability of Dates - Proposals will be evaluated on the ability of the offeror to provide the required services on the dates requested.

d. Other Considerations; transportation to major airports, availability and cost of on-site guest parking and diversified, adequate and reasonable food services must be available on-site and within walking distance.

Factor II - Past Performance

The offeror must provide references for at least three (3) federal government contracts for similar work performed within the past three (3) years. The offeror will be evaluated based on customer satisfaction and timeliness.  The contact information for each reference shall include the following: 

Contract type
Contract number
Contract Value
Agency/Company Name
Agency/Company point of contact telephone number
Duration of Contract
Type of services provided (brief description)
List any problems encountered on each contract and the contractor’s corrective actions

Factor III – Price
Proposed prices will be compared to proposed cost of same or similar services in order to determine if the proposed prices are realistic, fair and reasonable.  Although price is not the determining factor for award, it may become the determining factor for award if two or more offers, after technical evaluations are completed, are determined to be technically equal.

Thisnotice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendmentwill not be issued.The purpose of this amendment is to answer technical questions from vendors. Thequestions and answers are below.Accordingly,Question One (1): Does the fiber amplifier need to have adjustable or fixed gain? I.e. doyouneed external control of the pump diodes?Answer One (1): External control of the pump diodes is required.Question Two (2): Can you be more specific on exactly what are the input laserparameters? Is there a spec sheet available on the input laser?Answer Two (2): The input laser consists of an PM fiber-coupled, externally modulated(using acousto-optic modulator) DFB laser.  It will have a peak optical power around10-15 mW and a pulsewidth ranging from 300 - 1000 ns.  The DFB signal will have atransform-limited bandwidth.  More information can be found in the following publication:Mark Stephen, Michael Krainak, Graham Allan, Haris Riris, Narrow-band, Tunable,Frequency doubled, Erbium-doped Fiber-amplified Transmitter, August 1, 2007 / Vol. 32,No. 15 / Optics Letters.Question Three (3): What is the required rejection ASE wavelength range or FWHMbandwidth?Answer Three (3):  The FWHM bandwidth is 4 MHz.  The ASE must be at least 35 dB below thepeak at the lasing wavelengthQuestion Four (4): Can you be more specific on the electrical delay needed?Answer Four (4):  The electrical delay is required so that the same signal that modulatesthe input laser AOM can be used to drive the AOM between the pre-amp and the power amp tosuppress ASE in the pre-amp.  A small delay will compensate for the optical path lengthbetween the first and second AOM.Question Five (5):    AOM: will this be installed immediately after the output of thepre-amplifier?Answer Five (5):  Yes, the AOM will be installed after the pre-amp to suppress ASE beforethe final amplification stage.Question Six (6):      Electrical Relay, is this just for AOM driver only?Answer Six (6): YESQuestion Seven (7):	Please also let us know the driving frequency for the AOM.Answer Seven (7):  The AOM and driver frequencies are not specified as long as theymatch.The due date for receipt of offers is not extended.Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASAAcquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on 4/26/2009.

PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES    (JUN 2006)

(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)—
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held—
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/

INTRODUCTION

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its objectives and mandates OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts referred in OTI as the “bullpen”, serving on intermittent contracts to provide surge capacity for OTI in Washington and the field.  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization’s programmatic goals and objectives and must be prepared to work both in Washington and the field, often with little time for preparations.

The OTI Sr. Transition Advisor position was developed to allow OTI to take advantage of the accumulated experience of field staff following closure of the country program(s) which they managed.  As OTI is evolving to carry out more assessments, provide more experientially based technical advice and analysis, and facilitate earlier consideration of countries that face possible political crises, having access to individuals with hands-on experience in transition programming will enhance our ability to deepen understanding, identify opportunities and constraints, and be more prepared to execute programming when necessary.

To hire qualified personnel to provide expertise in transition programming.

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. “MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.”

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer’s liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled “Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.”  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor’s invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual’s behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

<p>FEDERAL AGENCY NAME: Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, AFRL - Rome Research Site, AFRL/Information Directorate, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY, 13441-4514</p>
<p>TITLE: ELINT COLLECTION AND PROCESSING</p>
<p>ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial announcement</p>
<p>FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA 07-08-IFKA</p>
<p>CFDA Number: 12.800</p>
<p>DATES: It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 08 should be submitted by 15 April 2008; FY 09 by 15 April 2009; and FY 10 by 15 April 2010. White papers will be accepted until 2:00 p.m. Eastern time on 30 Sep 2010, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited. FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME. See Section IV of this announcement for further details.</p>
<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The overall technical objectives of this BAA are to use innovative, disruptive technologies to collect and process ELINT signals and their associated SIGINT information. Technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence and enhanced or new digital processing hardware/software, will be used to: (1) Dynamically characterize and correlate databases that use existing multi-source, multi-platform, real-time collection systems; (2) Enhance collection system efficiency to include multi-platform collection optimization and management; and (3) Automate digital signal processing hardware and software analysis to enable a man-on-the-loop concept to address the increased volume of data and increased time criticality of analysis, both necessary to support Effects Based Operations of the future.</p>
<p>The scope of this effort concerns several areas and covers a broad range of issues, which include, but are not limited to the following: (1) Target specific characteristics identification/correlation; (2) Automated collection, signal ID sorting and first level processing; (3) Enhanced digital ELINT processing/analysis technology at both the Operational/Tactical and Scientific and Technical Intelligence (S&amp;TI) levels; (4) Software aboard UAV platforms which specifically address SIGINT objectives; (5) Advanced knowledge-based processing; and (6) Network centric collection management .</p>
<p>Detailed scope and definition of problems are as follows: (1) Target characteristic identification/correlation: Battlefield management depends heavily on ELINT and Electronic Warfare (EW) assets to provide current threat analysis for successful deployment of war-fighting resources. One area that supports this analysis is target specific operating characterization and equipment/unit correlation which is normally a "brute-force/labor intensive" effort: (2) Automated collection, signal identification (ID) sorting and first level processing. Dense, hard-to-get, advanced modulated, and Low Probability of Intercept (LPI) signals dictate the need for automated, dynamic collection using both on-board / off-board assets. This area should also allow for the improvement in signal sorting and identification, discrimination (&lsquo;flagging') of out-of-limits signals, especially threat systems whose measurable values can readily be characterized. Continual high-resolution sampling of Intermediate Frequency Modulation (IFM), pulse sorting, and deinterleaving processes using &lsquo;fingerprinting' techniques should continue to be investigated as a means to support flagging and automated tracking efforts; Signal identification algorithms for next generation target radars. (3) Enhanced digital ELINT processing: Environment complexity, as well as advanced collection hardware technology, demands growth in the digital ELINT processing arena. Efforts should take into consideration current analysis technology available, reduction in processing of routine activity allowing time to be spent on more critical tasks, methods employing horizontal, parallel processing, and how best to insert these solution(s) into existing systems. (4) Software aboard UAV platforms which specifically address SIGINT objectives: Given current levels of activity, operational requirements, hostile environments, and resources being heavily tasked, collection systems will need to coordinate and collaborate automatically with UAV-type SIGINT platforms. Host processing systems will enable net-centric collection and targeting using low power and weight digital receivers and a processing schema that operates modularly, in parallel, and in firmware. (5) Advanced Knowledge-Based Processing Techniques: Timely and accurate decision support to the warfighter require innovative knowledge-base processing for sensor management, emitter ID, flagging, and SIGINT fusion to include but not limited to techniques for automated knowledge acquisition and knowledge modeling, real-time inferencing, and real-time operating system. (6) Network centric collection management: Networked SIGINT sensors extend the sensor virtual collection space, thus significantly enhancing the potential to collect LPI/difficult waveform signals. Therefore, network centric collection management should be investigated to include but not be limited to multi-platform signal correlation and multi-INT sensor cueing. Attention should be paid to fusing the sensor measurements and network data bandwidth to support collection management. Deliverables will be technical reports and, when appropriate, demonstrations.</p>
<p>II. AWARD INFORMATION:</p>
<p>Total funding for this BAA is approximately $24.5M. The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 08 - $8.0M; FY 09 - $8.5M; and FY10 - $8.0M. Individual awards will not normally exceed 36 months with dollar amounts ranging between $250,000 and $350,000 per fiscal year.

<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET or TOP SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET or TOP SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.</p>
<p><br />3. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS. Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.</p>

The current IDIQ expires in Aug 2010.  The new IDIQ will begin no later than Aug 2010, but preferably o/a March 2010, and will be for a base year and four (4) single-year option periods.  Incumbents include CACI Premier Technologies, Camber Corporation, Dynamics Research Corporation, Northrop Grumman, and Research Triangle Institute.<BR><BR>The support of the current IDIQ has grown since award, due primarily to the need to have contractors replace Soldiers assigned to higher priority tasks in support of the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT).  In the base year of the IDIQ, the requirement was for approximately 75 instructors and 40 training/doctrine/combat capability developers.  It has fluctuated up and down since then.  Currently, USAARMC has approximately 215 contract instructors and about 40 training/doctrine/combat capability developers.  The Infantry Center can be assumed to have a similar requirement for contractor mission support, some of which is currently being fulfilled on the OPTARS contract.

One project may include Security Dog housing and training facilities with small Vet clinic. Security Force protection for setback and barriers may be required for some facilities. Asbestos and Lead based paint remediation may be required for some renovation or demolition projects. Hardstand construction may include aircraft apron or runway replacement. Projects may require short duration construction periods and proactive construction management to be successful.

<CONTACT>John Kusnierek, Phone (703) 875-4357, Email jkusnierek@ustda.gov
<DESC>Q1) Does the Proaero Program include the Confins International Airport and Infraero Airports?
A1) No, it does not include Confins nor any Airport under Infraero administration;

Q2) What is the geographical limit of the Proaero Program?

A2) The Proaero Program is a program of the State Government of Minas Gerais is limited geographically within the State of Minas Gerais, as it is not a federal program;

Q3) Following the construction or improvement of the airport, is maintenance the responsibility of the State or municipality?
A3) Each airport will be evaluated independently.  There will be an agreement between the State Government and ANAC (National Civil Aviation Agency) for the administration of some airports, where the maintenance will be the responsibility of the State through DER.  While other airports, where the municipality has the minimum infrastructure for administration, the maintenance will be carried out by the municipality.  This is an important issue, which should be addressed by the Technical Assistance.

Q4) What will be the products of the Technical Assistence?
A4) The products are described in the Terms of Reference, within the 7 tasks to be completed.  We would like to emphasize Tasks 2, 3, and 6, which include the revision of existing documents, prioritization strategies, implementation and administration of new airports, and analysis of development impacts before and after the Airports.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q1) O Programa ProAero inclui o Aeroporto Internacional de Confins e Aeroportos da Infraero?
A1) Não inclui Confins e nenhum Aeroporto sob Administração da INFRAERO;

Q2) Qual o limite geográfico do Programa ProAero?
A2) O Programa ProAero é um programa do Governo do Estado de Minas Gerais e se limita geograficamente ao Estado de Minas Gerais, não sendo um programa federal;

Q3) Após a construção ou melhoramento do Aeroporto, a manutenção é de responsabilidade do Estado ou do município?
A3) Cada aeroporto vai ser avaliado de uma maneira independente. Vai existir um convênio entre Governo do Estado  e ANAC (Agência Nacional de Aviação Civil)  para administração de alguns aeroportos, onde a manutenção será de responsabilidade do Estado através do DER e outros aeroportos onde o município já possui uma estrutura mínima para administração a manutenção será por conta do município. Este é um importante assunto que deverá ser abordado pela assistência técnica.

Q4) Quais são os produtos de entrega da assistência?
A4) Os produtos estão descritos no termo de referência, dentro das 7 tarefas a serem cumpridas.  Chamamos a atenção para as tarefas 2, 3 e 6, que contém os trabalhos de revisão de documentos existentes, estratégias de priorização, implementação e administração dos novos aeroportos e análise dos impactos de desenvolvimento antes e depois dos Aeroportos.
