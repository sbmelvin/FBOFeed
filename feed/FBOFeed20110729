<DESC>F-15E Mission Training Center (MTC) Follow-on Services Sources Sought Notice
<p>Description<br />I. Request for Information (RFI) for Planning Purposes. This is a Request for Information (RFI) in accordance with FAR 52.215-3 --Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997).</p>
<p>a) The Government is conducting market research to identify, as potential sources, companies that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to competently and competitively respond to requirements to provide training services for F-15E Mission Training Centers (MTC) following the end of the existing MTC services contract in July 2016. Only United States companies will be considered for contract award.</p>
<p>b) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and Proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Companies responding to this market research are advised that participation does not ensure participation in future solicitations or contract awards. The Government will not reimburse any company or individual for any expenses associated with preparation or participation in this research. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.</p>
<p>c) Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.</p>
<p>d) Background: The Combat Air Force's (CAF) Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) program is utilizing training simulation services at ACC, PACAF, and USAFE main operating bases for F-15C, F-15E, F-16 Block 50, and AWACS platforms, with interoperability between sites provided via the DMO Network (DMON). The F-15E MTC Integrated Product Team at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is responsible for fielding aircrew training device capability that ensures the trainers maintain concurrency with the aircraft co-located at each base. Currently this capability is provided through a commercial training simulation services contract that meets the Air Force requirements. This contract is programmed to end in July 2016. The Air Force wishes to continue with a simulation services contract on the F-15E MTCs at no less than one (1) location and no more than four (4) locations that may include three (3) USAF CONUS bases and one (1) OCONUS base. Contractors will be responsible for maintaining their simulation services concurrent with changes to aircraft and weapons operating at the respective locations. Each F-15E site will connect into the DMON and will have to meet the CAF DMO Interoperability Standards (described at http://www.dmodmt.com). An associate contract agreement with the network provider and other simulator manufacturers will be required in support of DMO integration.</p>
<p>e) The Government anticipates a FAR Part 15, non-personal services contract with a total delivery period of no fewer than three (3) years and no more than ten (10) years (three year base period with seven one year options).</p>
<p>f) All services will be housed in existing Government facilities with minimal infrastructure changes and utilized by personnel designated by the government. Government, contract or Air Force instructors, separate from this acquisition, will use all aspects of the services in preparation for and conduct of lessons.<br /><br />g) The purpose of this RFI is to determine offeror interest in providing F-15E MTC simulation services to the Air Force.</p>
<p>II. Program Requirements:</p>
<p>a) The F-15E MTC System will be a high-fidelity immersive simulation system that facilitates F 15E personnel training. This will include maintenance personnel engine run training and aircrew training at all levels, ranging from individual events in a single-ship mode of operation to large-scale, theater specific, composite force combat mission training and rehearsal in a distributed mission operation training environment.</p>
<p>b) The F-15E MTC will be an integrated set of hardware and software that will implement the performance requirements specified in a requirements document that this organization will provide in the request for proposal (RFP). The MTC will be required to support basic and advanced mission training, tactics development, theater exercise support in both local and Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) environments, and possibly operational test and evaluation, for all active duty F 15E aircraft employment capabilities.</p>
<p>c) Each F-15E MTC will include either two (2) or four (4) own-ships (one own-ship equals the front and back seat of the same aircraft), with a grand total of no more than 16 own-ships in service. Each Mission Simulator must be concurrent with the fielded aircraft baseline and capable of single-ship, local multi-ship, combat theater missions, and DMO training and mission operations. Each MTC will include computer generated force simulation, scenario generation capability, instructor-operator stations, and brief-debrief systems. Specific performance requirements for all system elements will be defined in the requirements documents, but will be similar to the following requirements for the existing system:<br /><br />1) Cockpits. The simulator system cockpits must be a high-fidelity representation of the F-15E aircraft including: controls, displays, avionics, weapons, sensors, communications, and aerodynamic flight modeling representative of the front and back seat of the F-15E aircraft. The system shall provide realistic simulation of F-15E handling characteristics for all normal ground and flight regimes. The system must be able to accurately represent all aircraft and weapons malfunctions. The system must be equipped with a full field-of-view visual display, digital image generation system for visual, night vision imaging system, joint helmet mounted cueing system (JHMCS), radar data base, and EO/IR data base. The cockpits will be designed for networked training scenarios of one or more participants and in addition allow for stand-alone, solo aircrew training. Cockpit hardware and software will be modular and an open architecture design to allow for flexibility for upgrades and incorporation of new hardware/software technology.</p>
<p>2) Synthetic Environment. The simulator will create a realistic, high fidelity environment capable of supporting a full range of mission scenarios. It will support a mix of constructive and interactive entities that react to aircraft flight maneuvers, avionics, weapons systems, and atmospheric conditions. It will accurately model physical, electronic, aerodynamic capabilities, and fly-out characteristics of real world threats. It will also accurately model and integrate the impact of aircraft countermeasures (i.e., chaff, flares, jamming, anti-radar maneuvers, etc.). It will realistically model electronic combat entities and their effects. Constructive entities will include blue, gray, and red air entities as well as ground based threats (i.e. air platforms, Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) sites, ground vehicles, ground sites, ground personnel, and maritime targets). Threats will operate under a realistic, dynamic command and control structure. The system will provide aerodynamic and visual simulation of aircraft battle damage.</p>
<p>3) Instructor Operator Station (IOS). Each IOS will provide the instructor the ability to independently monitor the simulation and all displays of an own-ship, or a combination of selected displays from the four interconnected own-ships. The system will also provide the capability to set up and run one or more independent simultaneous missions. It will also include the ability to simultaneously operate local and long-haul network devices and monitor all missions. This system must be capable of managing a DMO mission environment. The IOS will be capable of controlling and inputting threats, emergency procedures (EPs), malfunctions, instrument indications, and weapons hit/miss data. The IOS must provide means for generation, setup, monitoring, and evaluating simulated training scenarios and missions. These scenarios can be changed or modified by the instructors at any time during the mission via the IOS. The capability to share scenarios and missions between networked sites must be provided. The IOS will give the instructor the capability to insert specific or dynamically created situations into the simulation. This includes EPs, threats, instrument indications, weapon hit/miss data, and other mission events. The IOS will be capable of freezing/resetting individual or all four cockpits scenarios independently. The IOS must be capable of restarting at the point of freeze, start of mission, or at a dynamic instructor-selected point in the mission. The IOS must also be able to set mark points and repeatedly reset to those points. The IOS needs to allow generation of additional scenarios of varying classification levels concurrently with flying a scenario.</p>
<p>4) Visual Display System. The simulator system must include a state-of-the-art, high-fidelity digital image to present the aircrew with realistic, detailed, real-world imagery. This includes a fully correlated "out-the-window" visual display system supporting all aspects of complete mission training, including all cues necessary to support such training, as defined in ACC F-15E training syllabi and the Training Task List (TTL), to include night vision imaging systems. At a minimum, dynamic air model assessments (determination of range, closure, aspect angle, and visual identification) must support multi-ship tactical formations, Basic Fighter Maneuvers (BFM), Air Combat Maneuvers (ACM), and Air Combat Tactics (ACT) cues. Also, the visual system must support various air-to-ground missions such as Surface Attack Tactics (SAT), Close Air Support (CAS), and Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR), with ground and maritime static and dynamic targets. The visual display (out-the-window and in the cockpit for radar and EO/IR weapons capabilities) will provide a high-fidelity image (contrast, brightness resolution, scene complexity, etc.) to the aircrew.</p>
<p>5) Networking. The MTC must provide local area and wide area network capability and use the most current long-haul networking protocols. The systems will be capable of connecting to and being a full participant in the DMO environment for one, two, or more trainers and will be required to meet the CAF DMO standards.</p>
<p>6) Briefing/Debriefing Facilities. The brief/debrief capability should be able to provide a "God's eye" view, selected own-ship or target views, and full battlefield observation (observation of the entire scenario, or a selectable major portion thereof). The system should include the ability to independently observe displays of an own-ship or a combination of selected displays from the four interconnected own-ships. The system must have the capability to record full mission data for replay. Brief, real-time observation, and debrief capabilities of this system must support all four own-ships simultaneously. The recordings should be both archivable on removable media and transferable to other sites over the network. Minimum recording time length of 120 minutes will be supported (a longer recording time is highly desired). The current brief/debrief system represents an example of the required capability. The brief/debrief capability should be able to provide "before the mission" planning or briefing mode, "after the mission" debrief capability, and "real time" observation capability to watch the mission as it unfolds. The before/after mission period modes require a video teleconferencing capability for all participating crews, at the appropriate classification levels.</p>
<p>d) F-15E aircrew obtain over 20 percent of their overall training events through the MTC; therefore, Air Combat Command requires no break in training during the transition from the incumbent contractor. <br />e) F-15E MTCs must be delivered and maintained in a fully operational status that remains concurrent with the home station aircraft configuration and that maintains the ability to be available for use at least 95 percent of the time.</p>

<DESC><span>
<p>he Architect of the Capitol (AOC) has a requirement for Conservation and Restoration of the Brumidi Corridor paintings at the United States Capitol, Washington, District of Columbia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conservation and Restoration will fall into one or a combination of FULL RESTORATION, PARTIAL CONSERVATION, or REPLICATION as will be described in the Statement of Work. The wall and ceiling murals in the vaulted, ornately decorated Brumidi Corridors on the first floor of the Senate wing in the United States Capitol were painted in a variety of painting materials and techniques in the mid to late nineteenth century.</p>
<p>Most of the walls and ceilings were over-painted one or more times starting in the twentieth century. The conservation studies and treatment reports will be listed in solicitation and will be available for review.</p>
<p>The current conditions of the walls and ceilings in the Brumidi Corridors vary, so that the proportion of conservation to replication required will also vary with each area.</p>
<p>Contractor may be required to provide scaffolding where necessary for completion of their work.</p>
<p>The AOC is contemplating a 5 year contract, with separately priced line items for each phase/section of the work.</p>
<p>The RFP will be issued on or about August 25, 2011</p>

<DESC><p>USDA's Farm Service Agency, Kansas City Commodity Office (KCCO) intends to issue a request for proposals to provide aseptic food sample collection and laboratory testing services for food aid products procured for Government programs. The solicitation is expected to be available on or after July 29, 2011 and will be available electronically through the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website (http://www.fbo.gov). A hard copy of the solicitation will not be available for the acquisition. All future information regarding this acquisition, including solicitation amendments and award notices, will be published through FBO. Interested parties shall be responsible for ensuring that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. It is the intention of the Government to award a firm-fixed-price, indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity services contract to one firm with one base year and one option year. The anticipated date of receipt for offers will be on or near August 15, 2011.</p>
<p>Background:<br />The USDA routinely procures large quantities of various micronutrient-fortified,<br />processed/blended agricultural products for use in international food aid programs administered by USDA-Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). These specialized food products are distributed worldwide on behalf of the people of the United States to combat malnutrition and otherwise address food insecurities caused by manmade and natural disasters. Due to the impact food aid quality has on the missions of these Programs, the Government has a heightened interest in ensuring that the products which commodity contactors tender to the Government for acceptance meet contract specifications. To meet this objective, the Government is seeking to hire a firm to collect samples of these food products and to conduct the laboratory testing necessary to determine that products meet contract specifications.<br /><br />In general, we are seeking an experienced firm with the capability to collect samples of product at commodity contractors' plants located throughout the continental United States, conduct testing on specified factors for compliance with those factors' contractual requirements, and report findings individually.</p>

<a href="mailto:charles.lingafelt@faa.gov">charles.lingafelt@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>The purpose of this announcement is to provide questions and responses from the DRAFT SCREENING INFORMATION REQUESTS (SIR) covering the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) requirements for the National Security Officer Program.
The FAA is not seeking or accepting proposals (solicited or unsolicited) at this time. 
1.	Where are the actual post hours for each SIR?The unique Post Exhibit created for each facility location will identify the required post hours for that site.  An example post exhibit can be found in Section J, Attachment J.3.
2.	How many additional Temporary Additional Service Hours are estimated?The FAA does not have an estimated number of hours for CLIN 2, Temporary Additional Services (TAS) or CLIN 3 Emergency Security Services (ESS).  For evaluation purposes only, the FAA will add 16 hours per site per contact period for ESS and $25,000 on to the total proposal value for TAS.  This information is located in Section M.6, (a) Price Analysis.
3.	Are all posts required to be armed?No, a small number of facilities are unarmed.  The requirement for firearms will be contained in the site specific Post Order.  An example post order can be found in Section J, Attachment J.2.
4.	Are there any Clearances required at any of the locations outlined?One facility will require guards to obtain a secret level clearance.  This requirement will be contained in the site specific Post Order.  An example post order can be found in Section J, Attachment J.2.
5.	Is there an incumbent contractor and if so is the current contract broken down by regions, if so, how many employees in each region?No, there is no incumbent for this contract as currently scoped.
6.	What are the requirements for small company subcontracting/joint venture with a large business?This procurement will be conducted using a tiered evaluation of offerors where the FAA will proceed with the evaluation of offerors and award within the lowest tier found to contain adequate competition among technically acceptable offers.  More detailed information regarding this evaluation method can be found in Section M.3, (b) Evaluation of Offerors.
Awards made to large businesses will be required to establish an approved subcontracting plan in consultation with the FAA small business office.
It is intended that contractors will be allowed to submit offers as the prime contractor on only one service area solicitation.  However, contractors will be eligible to serve as subcontractors on all three service area awards without restriction.
The FAA will only recognize one prime contractor per offer.  It is the discretion of that Prime contractor that will determine the number and scope of subcontractors.  However, the limitations of AMS clause 3.6.1-7 will apply (at least 50% of the work must be performed by employees of the Prime contractor).

<DESC><p>SYNOPSIS<br /><br /><br />Introduction</p>
<p>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases. The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, has a requirement for a Structural Genomics Research Program.<br /><br /><br />Description</p>
<p>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), is seeking qualified contractors under this Request For Propsoal (RFP) to provide the following:</p>
<p>NIAID is recompeting the Structural Genomics Centers for Infectious Diseases program, herein referred to as the SGCID program. This program will build upon the objectives of the NIAID Genomics programs (http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/pathogenGenomics/research/Pages/relatedInitiatives.aspx) to continue to address the Institute's need to further expand the knowledge of the proteome of microbes.</p>
<p>The NIAID awarded two 5-year contracts in 2007 to support the Structural Genomics Centers for Infectious Diseases</p>
<p>1. SSGCID: Seattle Structural Genomics Center for Infectious Diseases (Contract No. HHSN272200700057C)<br />2. CSGID: Center for Structural Genomics for Infectious Diseases (Contract No. HHSN272200700058C)</p>
<p>To date, the incumbent Centers have utilized high-throughput structural biology technologies and determined more than 550 three-dimensional (3D) structures of protein targets of biomedical interest from bacterial, viral, and eukaryotic pathogens. Both Centers have been utilizing small molecule/ligand screening to increase crystallization success rate and to gain functional insight through the newly observed protein-ligand interactions. The targets' 3D structure information, as well as the expression clones and peptide materials for thousands of protein targets are made rapidly available to the scientific community. Importantly, these Centers have also been providing a 3D structure determination service to the scientific community and approximately 100 3D structures were solved for community targets.</p>
<p>The contracts to be awarded under this solicitation will continue to supply the 3D structure information, reagents and services to the broad scientific community. The contracts are expected to apply state-of-the art high-throughput (HTP) technologies and methodologies to experimentally characterize the 3D atomic structure of proteins or other molecules having an important biological role belonging to human pathogens, especially those in the NIAID Category A-C Priority Pathogen lists (http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/BiodefenseRelated/Biodefense/research/Pages/CatA.aspx) and organisms causing emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases (http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/emerging/Pages/list.aspx). The SGCID program will also allow for support of research projects that utilize experimental approaches to better characterize the molecular functional role of protein targets whose structure was determined by the incumbent and the to be awarded SGCID.</p>
<p>The structure determination services to be provided by the SGCID program to the scientific community are expected to encourage the establishment of collaborations of the SGCID centers with outside investigators that will make use of the provided 3D structure information and of other resources to gain further knowledge about the targets' functional mechanisms. The molecular 3D structure may also assist drug design and development by yielding direct insights into the target molecular mechanisms, in interaction with other biological molecules, or with synthetic compounds, in order to improve selectivity, specificity and optimize drug development in a rational way.</p>
<p>This RFP is anticipated to result in multiple awards to offeror(s) capable of performing all aspects Statement of Work. The anticipated contract award(s) are expected to be cost-reimbursement, level of effort type contracts. This requirement will consist of one (1) base period of one (1) year and four<br />(4) one (1) year option periods. In addition to the base level of effort, each year of performance is anticipated to contain an option for up to 3 additional FTEs, in the postdoctoral, technical, and other professional staff.<br /><br />All responsible and qualified sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Government. This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this project is 541711 with a size standard of 500 Employees.</p>
<p>The RFP is scheduled for electronic release via the FedBizOpps.gov https://www.fbo.gov/ on or about August 15, 2011 and receipt for proposals will be due on or about 2:30 p.m., Eastern Prevailing Time on November 7, 2011. <br /><br />Interested parties are expected to review this notice and the Request for Proposal to familiarize themselves with the requirements of the project; failure to do so will be at your firm's own risk. All information required for submission of a proposal will be contained in the electronic RFP package.</p>

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a quotation. A solicitation document will not be issued and quotations will not be requested.
<p>National Institute on Drug Abuse, Office of Acquisitions- Neurosciences, Station Support/Simplified Acquisitions on behalf of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the King's College of London, Great Britain. The purpose of the proposed procurement is to discover blood based biomarkers predictive of longitudinal changes in brain volumes and memory in non-demented elderly. The identification of such biomarkers in asymptomatic older individuals is critical for the development of disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD) targeting brain atrophy and memory decline.</p>
<p>The NIA shall provide 520 archived plasma samples (1.5 ml aliquots in EDTA) to the IoP, KCL for proteomic analyses. The IoP will provide results of targeted assays of lipoproteins, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, GeLC-MS/MS discovery phase findings, and quantitative immunoassays.</p>
<p>This contract will provide the Government with critical knowledge that will be used in identifying blood biomarkers predictive of rates of brain atrophy and memory decline in non-demented elderly. This information is central to studies in our Laboratory examining modifiers of age-related brain pathology and cognitive decline and will aid in the development of future observational studies and disease-modifying clinical trials.</p>
<p>Professor Simon Lovestone and his team at the King's College have already carried out prior studies using proteomic analyses of plasma samples from the BLSA. Results and samples from these previous studies form the basis of the proposed experiments. The newly assayed samples must be assayed in the same laboratory with the same techniques to avoid problems associated with inter-laboratory variation.<br />It is anticipated that 12 months is required.<br />The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition using FAR 13 procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.</p>

<SUBJECT>Mental Health Retrosight  for the Development of a Research Methodology Suitable to Studying in-depth the Impact of Basic and Clinical Research Studies in Schizophrenia
<SOLNBR>2178535
<RESPDATE>081011
<CONTACT>Susan Nsangou, Phone 3014432104, Email nsangous@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a quotation. A solicitation document will not be issued and quotations will not be requested.
<p>National Institute on Drug Abuse, Office of Acquisitions- Neurosciences, Station Support/Simplified Acquisitions on behalf of the National Institute on Mental Health intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with RAND Europe in Cambridge, United Kingdom. Billions of dollars are invested each year on research related to the prevention and treatment of mental disorders. Despite the large annual investment, few studies have examined the long-term clinical success and economic impact of this research or sought to identify key characteristics associated with research that has had later significant positive impact on public health. Furthermore, there is a common perception that mental health research has been particularly poorly translated from bench to bedside in comparison to other diseases and disorders.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) seeks to build upon successful methodologies that have already been used to evaluate the clinical and economic outcomes associated with diabetes, arthritis, and cardiovascular disease research funding in order to address the long-term outcomes associated with research on schizophrenia. The aim of this project is a) to develop a research methodology for the long-term analysis of the factors associated with successful basic and clinical research on schizophrenia, and b) to pilot test this research methodology through a series of case studies. The methodology should be readily adaptable to other mental disorders, and should be able to be implemented both nationally and internationally.</p>
<p>The Mental Health Retrosight project will involve the development of a research methodology suitable to studying in-depth the impact that basic and clinical research studies on schizophrenia have had on clinical and community practice over the past 25 years.</p>
<p>With a focus on basic and clinical schizophrenia research, this project aims to:</p>
<p>&bull; Identify the long term payback from mental health research</p>
<p>&bull; Explore factors that are associated with the successful translation of research</p>
<p>&bull; Provide insights and policy provocations that will inform future funding policy</p>
<p>As envisioned, the project will include a series of case studies highlighting research that has been successfully translated from bench to bedside. The case studies should be developed through a range of methods including key information interviews, document and literature reviews, historiographic analysis and bibliometrics. Once the field work has been completed and the case studies have been systematically compared, they should be qualitatively coded to identify factors associated with high quality impact. These qualitative data will then be used to develop actionable policy recommendations for institutions that fund research on schizophrenia. <br />The contractor shall:</p>
<p>1. Develop a series of 8 detailed case studies based on a review of the scientific literature and on key informant interviews with the principal investigators, co-applicants, and other researchers involved. In addition, other sources of funding and collaboration at the time will be mapped, and publications emerging directly from the research will be identified for detailed bibliometric analysis.</p>
<p>2. Draft case study narratives that will be shared with and cleared by the principal investigators and then independently peer-reviewed by experts in the field. Reviewers will be asked to assess the accuracy of both the science described and the attribution of impacts of the research to the following categories: knowledge production; research targeting and capacity building; informing policy and product development; health and health sector benefits; and broader economic benefits. The impact ratings will be used to categorize the case studies into high, mid and low impact groups, and these groups will then be used to identify common characteristics and potential drivers of research impact.</p>
<p>The principal deliverable will be a final report that thoroughly outlines the project's methodology, data analyses, and policy suggestions.</p>
<p>The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition using FAR 12 procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>RAND Europe has already begun identical projects examining outcomes associated with schizophrenia research investments in Canada and the United Kingdom. During the Spring of 2011, RAND Europe began exploring the bibliometric aspects of similar research in the United States. Support for continuing this work is crucial to ensure that the impact of the United States' investments in this field are understood for future decision making, and that the results are comparable to those conducted in other countries.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) intends to award a sole source firm fixed price purchase order using simplified acquisition procedures to Parvus Corporation, 3222 S. Washington Street, Salt Lake City, UT 84115-3426 for two (2) DuraMar 1000 Series Mobile IP Router, P/N 111S08080090H34. This purchase is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. Parvus is the only manufacturer of the off-the-shelf militarized controller that meets MIL-STD-461 and MIL-STD-801 and that meets the minimum performance requirements. Development time for another vendor to ruggedize this component would be 6-9 months, which would have a negative impact on the MVCS project schedule, causing a slip in the delivery of the units to the LCS ship 3 and 4 Seaframe.
  Currently, Parvus is the only vendor for this specific part numbered item, that meets form, fit and function requirements.  There are no other possible sources that can satisfy this requirement without significant additional cost, schedule risk and technical risk to the Government. Delivery will be to the Receiving Office, Naval Support Activity-Panama City (NSA-PC), Building 100, 101 Vernon Ave, Panama City, FL 32407-7018.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>NASA/GRC is hereby soliciting information about potential partnering opportunitiesfor the purpose of openly soliciting a partner to assist in the preparation of a proposalwith NASAS GRC for the PLANETARY INSTRUMENT DEFINITION AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM, to besubmitted to NASA Headquarters.  PREFACEThe NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) seeks partners for proposal development in responseto Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES)  2011, Solicitation:NNH11ZDA001N, C.16 Planetary Instrument Definition and Development. This Notice ofPartnering Opportunity (NPO) seeks potential partners to participate in a proposaldevelopment activity that addresses the definition and development of scientificinstruments to characterizing the near-surface soil mechanics properties and providinggeophysics and prospecting data of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs), the Moon, Mars, orPhobos.   The offeror(s) chosen will participate directly as a member of the proposalteam in the various stages of the instrument definition, design, technology developmentand integration, and the proposal process.SECTION 1  INTRODUCTIONGENERAL INFORMATIONThe Planetary Instrument Definition and Development Program (PIDDP) supports theadvancement of spacecraft-based instrument technology that shows promise for use inscientific investigations on future planetary missions. The goal of the program is not todevelop flight- qualified hardware, but rather to define and develop scientificinstruments or components of such instruments to the point where the instruments may beproposed in response to future announcements of flight opportunity without additionalextensive technology development. Planetary Instrument Definition and Development Program Status:  The Appendix C.16Announcement of Opportunity (AO) was released, as amended, on June 10, 2011.  http://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary.do?method=init&solId={AEF75D0F-2272-7DE7-D52A-295B47C8F5CF}&path=openThe Planetary Instrument Definition and Development Program has contributed to thedevelopment of flight hardware flown on, or selected for, many of NASAs planetarymissions. The proposed instrument technology must address specific scientific objectivesof likely future science missions.   More information on the Earth Venture project isavailable athttp://science.nasa.gov/about-us/smd-programs/earth-system-science-pathfinder/PURPOSE OF NOTICEThe GRC planetary instrument team is issuing this Notice of Partnering Opportunity forthe purpose of openly soliciting an instrument partner to assist in the preparation of aPIDDP proposal to be submitted to NASA HQ.  This open and competitive process is beingconducted in accordance with NASA FAR Supplement 1872.308.  By this Notice, the GRC teamis seeking information from partners regarding their availability, capabilities, pastperformance, and anticipated development costs that relate to planetary scienceinstruments, technologies and capabilities for the PIDDP AO.  This Notice also authorizesNASA GRC to award contracts to its selected spacecraft partner without furthercompetition or justification, should the proposal be selected.This partnering opportunity is being issued to select a teaming partner for the GRCplanetary instrument technology development and integration, and to support the teamthroughout the instrument definition and development.  The offeror(s) chosen willparticipate directly as a member of the proposal team in the various stages of theinstrument design and proposal process.PARTICIPATIONParticipation in this partnering synopsis is open to all categories of U.S. and non-U.S.organizations, including educational institutions, industry, not-for-profit institutions,the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, as well as NASA Centers and other U.S. GovernmentAgencies. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Other MinorityUniversities (OMUs), small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs)(8a), veteran-owned smallbusinesses, service disabled veteran-owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses,and women-owned small businesses (WOSBs) are encouraged to apply. Participation bynon-U.S. organizations is welcome but subject to NASAs policy of no exchange of funds, inwhich each government supports its own national participants and associated costs.SECTION 2  SCOPE	OVERVIEWThis Notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into acontract.  This Notice is subject to revision or cancellation at any time.Based on the responses to this Notice, GRC anticipates selecting one or multipleinstrument suppliers with which GRC would then immediately work directly with indevelopment of the multifunctional cone penetrometer.  During the proposal developmentphase, more specific roles and cost estimates for the selected partners will bedeveloped.  If the GRC instrument proposal is selected, GRC intends to negotiate withoutfurther competition or justification, a contract with the proposal partner, consistentwith their agreed upon role and this Notice.  During these contract negotiations, thespecific statement of work, contract terms and conditions, and contract value will beformalized.  There will be no exchange of funds between NASA and the selected partner for the GRCplanetary instrument proposal development.  That is, NASA will not be responsible for anycosts incurred by respondents in preparing a response to this Notice or by the selectedpartner in preparation of the GRC planetary instrument proposal.DETAILS OF THE OPPORTUNITYGRC Planetary Instrument Schedule:  Schedule:  The following schedule describes the major milestones for the Earth Ventureproposal.AO release (amended):	June 10, 2011Proposals Due:		August 26, 2011Selection Announced:	NASA Fiscal Year 2012ATP:			Six months after proposal due datePre-selection proposal supportThe potential partner shall provide support using their own resources.	This willinvolve:Weekly telecom meetings with the science and engineering teamHelping to define the end-to-end performance requirements, including instrumentinterfaces and technology developments, etc.Identifying study topics, prediction performance, and conducting trade studiesCost estimation for all proposal phasesPreparation of the instrument proposal for submittal to NASA Updates to technical, cost and schedule inputs as required for integrated proposalsubmittalIt is expected that the selected partner would provide (at no cost to NASA), conceptualdesigns, technical data, proposal inputs, schedule and cost estimates consistent with theproposal AO when released.PLANTARY INSTRUMENT  Multi Functional Cone PenetrometerThe offeror shall propose an instrument (or subsystem thereof) capable of characterizingthe near-surface soil mechanics properties and providing geophysics and prospecting dataof near-Earth asteroids (NEAs), the Moon, Mars, or Phobos. This instrument, amultifunction cone penetrometer, will provide data to reduce risk, improve theoperability, and reduce the end-to-end mission cost of design and verification testing ofregolith-interacting mechanical systems for extraterrestrial surface operations. Sciencerequirements derived from prior NASA studies explicitly discuss surface penetration, inpart to characterize surface composition. The GRC instrument team seeks to develop a conepenetrometer (CP) to accomplish soil mechanics characterization goals, and willincorporate additional functions. This larger goal is accomplished by developing asmall-scale multifunction CP that integrates the full suite of currently developedterrestrial CP functions. This multifunction CP will provide geotechnical, geophysical,and resource prospecting data in a single compact package. Proposers should addresstechnical innovations required in measurement functions, and drive and anchoringmechanisms.  In particular, integration of stress, shear modulus, and temperature sensingin a compact cone package are sought.  Innovative approaches to self-anchoring mechanicaldevices and drive mechanisms enabling light weight, compact instrument packaging aresought.  The plan should also identify major milestones and facilities available for assemblingand testing each component.  SECTION 3  RESPONSES TO NOTICEThe evaluation team will use the following factors in selection and award.  Thegovernment will evaluate the submitted proposal based on these factors that are listed inorder of importance:a.Technical capability:  Offeror(s) will be evaluated on the approach for design,development, integration, and test of the proposed instrument innovations.  The approachto infusion of instrument technology developments will be of  primary importance.b.Relevant experience, past performance, and availability of key personnel:  Thiscriterion evaluates the offerors relevant recent experience, past performance in similardevelopment activities, and key personnel available to support the development. Capability includes quality and management process certifications and systems.c.Cost and Schedule:  Offerors will be evaluated on cost and schedule performance onsimilar development activities.  Proposals will be evaluated on the affordability oftheir approach, and the overall probable cost, including the offerors willingness toshare cost risk.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION
<p>"This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice."</p>
<p>This is strictly market research; therefore no questions regarding this market research will be entertained.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Program Support Center Federal Occupational Health Service (FOHS) provides a broad range of occupational health services to other Federal agencies. Under the Safe Work Environments for Emergency Personnel II project, FOHS provides safe places for Federal disaster responders to assemble, set up regional emergency operations centers, ship pre-staged Federal disaster response kits to disaster sites, receive kits back from disaster sites, and prepare kits for future disaster response operations. SWEEP II facilities are expected to range in size from 4,000 to 100,000 square feet to support Federal personnel who will operate regional, national and international emergency response centers in the event of disasters.<br /><br />PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES</p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to obtain logistics and transportation support services in order to establish and operate safe work sites for Federal emergency response teams. <br /><br />The objectives of the project are to:<br />1. Obtain leases for offices and warehouses at commercial locations selected by the Government<br />2. Prepare the sites for use by the Federal emergency response teams<br />3. Transport Federal supplies and equipment to and from the sites<br />4. Provide material handling, cleaning, repacking and inventory support<br />5. Provide ongoing site support services such as cleaning and maintenance.</p>
<p>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS<br /><br />The Government is seeking vendors who can meet the following project requirements.<br />1. Secure leases from commercial office and warehouse owners at sites selected by the Government. Leases shall be for 12 months, followed by one to four option years.<br />2. Prepare leased sites for use by Federal emergency response teams. This requirement includes cleaning, painting, installing tile or carpet flooring; installing or upgrading physical security assets such as alarm systems, skylight grills, and fences; conducting minor upgrades to existing electrical systems to handle heavier current loads; and construction of small rooms to store controlled pharmaceutical supplies in accordance with DEA regulations.<br />3. Transporting heavyweight freight via air, ocean or ground express subcontractors to and from SWEEP sites.<br />4. Providing material handling laborers and material handling equipment, usually on an on-call basis; conducting periodic inventories of Government supplies and equipment at each site; cleaning equipment returning from disaster response operations in the field; and repackaging supplies and equipment.<br />5. Providing routine site support services such as monthly cleaning, pest control services, minor repairs (in conjunction with the site owner/operator), and utilities payments (if not included in lease terms).<br />6. Providing monthly activity reports and invoices for payment, and providing quarterly or annual inventory reports as needed.<br /><br />ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>Services will be required for a base year from November 1, 2011 to October 31, 2012; with four option years. One to three sites operational in the base year may be phased out at the end of the base year. Current plans are to phase in three new sites for other Federal agencies at other locations during the base year. Additional sites may be phased in or out during the option years, depending on the needs of the Government.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS</p>
<p>Since these sites involve emergency operations, vendors may be asked to provide services after normal business hours, on weekends, and during holidays</p>
<p>HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO SUBMIT CAPABILITY STATEMENTS.</p>

<DESC><br />The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award, on a sole source basis, a firm fixed price contract to the University of Florida fot an Evaluation of Synergistic activities and efficacy of combination drug theropy for early treatment of multi-drug resistant (MDR) inhalation anthrax in murine model. This acquisition for an in vivo research study using the mouse model to evaluate the therapeutic benefit and synergistic activity of various antimicrobial agent combinations for the treatment of inhalation anthrax resulting from exposure to a Bacillus anthracis strain that is resistant to the first-line antimicrobial treatment agent ciprofloxacin. This research study will address the CDC and HHS priority for multidrug resistant (MDR) organisms with potential for bioterrorist use as identified in the HHS Strategy and Implementation Plan for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threats. This study will also provide data addressing Homeland Security Presidential Directive 18 which calls for development of the capacity to address enhanced biological threat agents, including MDR Bacillus anthracis strains resistant to the first-line recommended antimicrobial agents ciprofloxacin and doxycycline. Justification for other than full and open competition is considered due to the fact that University of Florida is proposed as the contractor for this study. The Senior Scientist at University of Florida is Dr. Henry Heine, who provides University of Florida with unique and extensive experience using the mouse Bacillus anthracis aerosolized spore challenge model - which was selected for use in this study - as the principle investigator for the development and validation of this animal research model (Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2007; 51(4):1373-9), and who has published as lead investigator multiple studies testing the efficacy of drugs used for the prophylaxis and treatment of inhalation anthrax in this research model. Dr. Heine at University of Florida has available existing published and unpublished research data from previous studies on the pharmacokinetics of those antimicrobial drugs and on their optimization in the mouse model, and many of those drugs will be tested in this project. This will eliminate the need for the conduct of preliminary single-drug pharmacokinetic studies on these drugs to enable comparison with the multidrug antimicrobial agent combination pharmacokinetic studies, which will be necessary to measure any impact of the use in the multidrug regimens on the pharmacokinetics of the individual component drugs. Note 22 applies herein. The NAICS code for this requirement is 541712. The statutory authority permitting other-than-full-and-open competition is 41 U.S.C., 253(c)(1): FAR 6.302-1. Only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract will be based on responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will be considered solely for informational purposes. This procurement is not set-aside for small business. Please note that an award will be issued to a vendor who is registered and validated in CCR and has a DUNS number. All inquiries must be clearly marked on the subject line of the e-mail (Reference #95741). This procurement is not set-aside for small business. For contractual questions contact Gary Morgan by email at glm1@CDC.gov, no phone calls will be addressed. All concerns should be e-mailed.<br />

<DESC>This is a Special Notice with justification of intent to award sole source. (1) NATURE OR DESCRIPTION OF ACTION: The proposed action is purchase Plastic Sphere Dispenser (PSD) balls. Aerial Ignition Spheres are designed for use the Premo Mark III Aerial Ignition Device which is the only Plastic Sphere Dispenser authorized for use by USDA Forest Service. (2) DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES: The Aerial Ignition Sphere is made of high impact polystyrene, 32-mm (1.25 inches) in diameter and contains approximately 3.0 grams of potassium permanganate. The rate of chemical reaction is dependent on the particle size and concentration of the chemicals involved. Undiluted, ethylene glycol-based antifreeze is required. It provides a reliable ignition and a time delay of at least 20 seconds. The Aerial Ignition Spheres are dispensed commonly from aircraft by the Plastic Sphere Dispenser (PSD) machine that was developed to provide a method of igniting ground fuels, in a short time, on large acreage without causing undue damage. (3) STATUTORY AUTHORITY: FAR 6.230-1: Only one responsible source and no other supplies or service will satisfy agency requirements. 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1). (4) DEMONSTRATION OF CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS: PREMOFIRE and Aerostat Inc PSD balls both have been used by the USDA Forest Service in the past. Based on Market Research and advertising they are the only distributors of Aerial Ignition Sphere tested and authorized for use with the Premo Mark III PSD Machines.
<p>Vanguard Plastics:</p>
<p>PREMO PLASTICS was established in 1969 in Victoria, BC. Over the years, PREMO established itself as a trusted, quality manufacturer specializing in forestry services and fire suppression. In 2005, Premo Plastics was acquired by Vanguard Plastics, a plastic manufacturer based in Surrey, British Columbia. PREMO is part of the VPL Enterprises Family. PremoFire manufactures and distributes the world's most popular aerial ignition system, Premo Mark III Aerial Ignition Device, along with our PremoFire Aerial Ignition Spheres. They have been supplying the global wildland fire and aerial firefighting industry for over 25 years, and have in the past had a reputation for safe, reliable operations. <br /><br />Aerostat Inc:<br /><br />Aerostat, Inc. is based in central Florida in the city of Leesburg. It has maintained its headquarters there since its inception more than twenty-five years ago. Some time ago Aerostat recognized problems with the quality and uninterrupted supply of aerial ignition spheres manufactured outside of the United States. In keeping with its commitment to be able to supply users of the spheres in a timely fashion it made arrangements to have the spheres manufactured in the United States. As part of this arrangement it required that the suppliers of items needed to produce the spheres also be United States domiciled companies. As a result Aerostat is the only company that distributes spheres made in the United States. In a letter dated May 15, 2009, the Interagency Helicopter Operations Steering Committee formally approved the use of the aerial ignition spheres distributed by Aerostat, Inc., after extensive testing, for use in the MK III Plastic Sphere Dispenser. The Forest Service has used Aerostat PSD balls which have worked flawlessly in the past. On March 11, 2011, Andy Smith, Business Development Manager for PREMOFIRE called and advises of a manufacturing error with the Fireballs that were supplied. PREMOFIRE thought the problem could be solved by adding reinforcing plastic around the seam to keep the balls from breaking apart. The welds were made to large causing some of the spheres not to fit through the chutes as designed. Defective seals split open causing aerial spheres to hang up in the feed chutes, creating safety hazards as well as making it difficult to clean up residue in the machines and on the sides of the helicopter. This created many safety issues for the Forest Service which is still under review. Incidents have been documented in SAFECO, the aviation safety communicator. One recorded incident documents that the operator had to pump water into a Plastic Sphere Dispenser to cool the burning plastic. On a similar incident the sphere cause machine to jam and could not be cleared causing operator to use water button with additional amounts of water from canteen into the hopper to reduce the chance of fire. When fully checked it was found that the balls had separated and attached itself to another ball making it to large to fall down feed chute and into the hopper. Aerostat Incorporated is reliable and the only other source that manufactures and distribute PSB balls for use in the Premofire Aerial Ignition Devices. (5) FEDERAL BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES (FEDBIZOPS) ANNOUNCEMENT POTENTIAL SOURCES: In previous year's solicitation were place on FEDBIZOPPS and GSA E-Buy. Quotes were requested from 21 sources and each replied with negative responses. (6) DETERMINATION OF FAIR AND REASONABLE COST: Price is determined to be fair and reasonable based on comparison of previous purchases from PREMOFIRE and Aerostat that were found to be fair and reasonable by the USDA Forest Service. (7) MARKET SURVEY: The internet, GSA E-buy, Central Contractor Repository, FEDBIZZOPPS and discussion with vendors were all used to obtain information on possible suppliers. The only other suppliers of polystyrene spheres were PyroShot and the Red Dragon Aerial Ignition which operate using SEI Industries Dragon Eggs polystyrene spheres with 3 grams of potassium permanganate crystals. Dragon Eggs can only be used on the Red Dragon and will not fit the PREMO MK II Device. (8) ADDITIONAL SUPPORTING EVIDENCE: N/A. (9). OTHER INTERESTED SOURCES: None. (10) ACTIONS TAKEN TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO COMPETITION: PREMOFIRE are taking actions to resolve their manufacturing and production issues. When Vanguard Industries can show proof that their PSB balls are safe for use in our devices we will once again consider this company for future award.</p>

<DESC>This is a notice of intent for sole source award.  The justification for other than full and open competition is as follows:
JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THANFULL AND OPEN COMPETITION - FAR 6.302-1(d)(1)
In accordance with the authority granted under 41 U.S.C. 253(c), this request for award under other than full and open competition is hereby submitted.
1.  Identification of the agency and the contracting activity.
	Requesting OfficeDOI-NPS-WASO - Park Cultural Resources Programs
Contracting Office	DOI - NPS - WASO - WCP 
2.   Nature and/or description of the action being approved.
The acquisition is for a sole source award to HDR Engineering for the purchase of the Louisiana SHPO's review, investigation, comment and signature on Shoreline Treatment Recommendation (STR) Reports created by the NPS in conjunction with the US Coast Guard in response to the Gulf of Mexico Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill (DWH).  
3.  A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value).
BP's Deepwater Horizon oil rig located in the Gulf of New Mexico exploded on April 20, 2010.  The Department of Interior was among the Federal agencies dispatched by the President to respond to the spill.  The Bureau of Ocean & Energy Management, Fish & Wildlife Service and the National Park Service mobilized to support overall response and restoration efforts under the direction of the U.S. Coast Guard, subsequently designated Lead Federal Agency.  NPS is providing support and coordination to the US Coast Guard for compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA) requires Federal agencies to take into account the effects of their undertakings on historic properties.  If the agency's undertaking could affect historic properties, the agency determines the scope of appropriate identification efforts and then proceeds to identify historic properties in the area of potential effects. The agency, in consultation with the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) makes an assessment of any adverse effects on the identified historic properties based on criteria found in the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation's regulations. The State of Louisiana delegated their decision making authority as the SHPO to an employee of HDR Engineering. The NPS and the USCG created Shoreline Treatment Recommendation (STR) reports in response to the oil spill.  The STR's are the Federal government's "proposed federal undertakings" in response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill for the purposes of the NHPA.  On behalf of the SHPO, HDR Engineering has consulted, investigated, commented, reviewed, and signed these reports in an expedited manner to facilitate the Federal government's response.  The NPS did not request this work to be done or authorize it at any point.  As the SHPO, HDR's employee, Melissa Braud, consulted, investigated, commented, reviewed, and signed these reports on her own initiative.  However, the NPS now requires these reports to move forward with the Federal government's proposed undertaking in response to the oil spill in compliance with NHPA Section 106.  
4.  An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.
FAR 6.302-1 - Unique source and no other supplies or services satisfy agency requirements.  Specifically, FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(i) when there is a reasonable basis to conclude that the agency's minimum needs can only be satisfied by a unique supply or service available from one source.  
5.  A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.
The State of Louisiana has delegated their consultation authority under Section 106 of NHPA to only one party, an employee of HDR Engineering.  
6.  A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 5.2, and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.
Although it is possible to obtain a report of this nature from other sources under different circumstances; the State of Louisiana has delegated their consultation authority under Section 106 of NHPA to HDR Engineering. Accordingly, it would not be possible for another entity to provide the required deliverable. 
7.  A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable and the basis for that determination.
Although this will be awarded as a firm fixed price for this deliverable, HDR Engineering provided a price breakdown based on labor hour rates and the level of effort required to generate the review, investigation and comment to the STR reports.  A review of GSA contract holders offering similar services has demonstrated that the labor hour rate proposed to be fair and reasonable, and the program office has stated that the level of effort proposed to create this deliverable is reasonable as well. 
8.  A description of the market research conducted (FAR part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.
Market Research was not conducted since this effort was part of the oil spill disaster, and the State of Louisiana has delegated their consultation authority under Section 106 of NHPA to a HDR Engineering.
9.  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition (FAR 6.303-2(a) (9)).
None.
10.  A listing of sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.
None.
11.  A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the same supplies or services. 
NPS will continue to monitor the current market to insure products that enter the market are considered for future utilization and to continue to perform the market research necessary to obtain the best value to the government while continuing to support the NPS mission.
12.  CERTIFICATIONS:
I hereby certify that this justification for other than full and open competition is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
I hereby certify that this requirement does not exceed the Government's minimum needs or schedule requirements and that the basis for award under other than full and open competition is complete and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC>Description<br />The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to enter into negotiations with EC/R, Incorporated for a four-month extension to existing contract, EP-D-07-019, on a sole source basis, IAW FAR 6.302-1(a)(2). The current contract was awarded on a small business set-aside competition basis and is to expire 08/31/11. A follow-on competitive procurement is in process, however, it will not be awarded before EP-D-07-019 expires. This contract is for services in support of The Environmental Protection Agency's Sector Policies and Programs Division's (SPPD) program to provide support for the first component, source specific regulatory programs. The source specific regulatory component of the EPA's air toxics program includes the development of technology-based standards for major and area sources, residual risk standards, as well as, other standards development activities. The EPA has completed the last set of MACT standards under section 112(d). These standards regulate emissions primarily from major stationary sources. Section 112(k) requires the development of standards for area sources, which account for 90% of the emissions in urban areas of the 33 urban hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) listed in the Integrated Urban Air Toxics Strategy. These area source standards can require control levels which are equivalent to either MACT or GACT, as defined in section 112. Residual risk standards, required by section 112(f), cover the same sources as the technology-based standards developed under any section of the CAA and are required if EPA determines, by conducting a source specific risk assessment, that the public's health is not protected with an ample margin of safety with the technology-based standard.
<p>In addition to developing standards that regulate the emissions of air toxics from stationary sources, the SPPD is responsible for developing stationary source criteria pollutant standards. These standards may take the form of either a New Source Performance Standard (NSPS), as defined in Section 111 of the CAA, or a standard based on "best available controls" (BAC), as defined in section 183(e) of the CAA. The purpose of section 183(e) is to limit the amount of volatile organic compounds (VOC) emitted into the air from a wide variety of consumer and commercial products. In some instances, the CAA gives the EPA the authority to develop a guidance document, such as a Control Techniques Guideline (CTG) document, in lieu of a standard. This contract is also intended to provide support for all of these source specific criteria pollutant standards development and guidance document activities.</p>
<p><br />The Agency has a substantial investment in the unique experience and knowledge that EC/R developed while providing support for metals, minerals and energy sectors for SPPD. EC/R has been providing support for these programs since Contract EP-D-07-019 was awarded in 2007. They are uniquely qualified to provide the additional four-month effort because timing is critical and no other contractor could acquire the knowledge and expertise of the regulatory sectors in the time frame that is required. It would take substantial duplication of time and money for another contractor to provide the service that would meet this requirement, and the costs are not expected to be recovered through competition.</p>
<p>This synopsis is a notice of intent to issue an award for contract extension under other than full and open competition and should not be considered a request for competitive proposals. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement not later than August 15, 2011 at 2:00 p.m. EST. Responses must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet these requirements. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether competition is viable. If no acceptable timely responses are received, the contract with EC/R will be extended by a four-month period. A determination by the Government not to compete this contract extension, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Oral communications are not acceptable. E-mail your interest to newsome.otelia@epa.gov. Award is anticipated on or about August 23, 2011.</p>

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) intends to execute a contract modification to increase the contract maximum amount for Lockheed Martin Corporation's basic contract N00014-08-D-0748 from $7,000,000 to $10,500,000. This contract was awarded using full and open competition under BAA 08-003. ONR envisioned a three-phase, down-select, IDIQ task order approach for developing the Sense and Respond Logistics (S&amp;RL) network architecture. The Government required cost proposals for all three phases under the solicitation. Updated cost proposals for Phases II and III were a required deliverable for the initial Phase I task orders and Phase II task order. Task order solicitations for Phase II and Phase III were not issued, since "proposals" were a required deliverable. The Government's intent was to down-select to one Phase II contractor and one Phase III contractor. ONR received eleven (11) responses to BAA 08-003, with a down select from eleven (11) companies to three (3) companies for Phase I awards. The outcome of the Phase I competition between BBN, Honeywell and Lockheed Martin was an award to Lockheed Martin for Phase II, and later, partial tasking for Phase III.
<p>This increase is provided to Lockheed Martin based on their extensive technical knowledge gained as both the lead integrator for the S&amp;RL products and the primary consumer of the MAGTF C2 SOI. This knowledge provides Lockheed Martin a unique and valuable understanding of the most efficient and effective path to meet the requirements of USMC and ONR stakeholders. To date, Lockheed Martin has successfully designed and developed the baseline for the Information Architecture, to include a Shared Data Environment, Partner Services and an Open Agent Communication Network. Under the increased ordering amount, ONR intends to award a subsequent task order to continue the development of technology to fully mature those capabilities and support inclusion of emerging technologies to optimize the dynamic, nonlinear demands of USMC logistics. The subsequent tasks include: develop intelligent reasoning within the IA; enhance the interface/integration development within the MAGTF C2 SOI environment; establish/participate in Science and Technology evaluations to fully mature the product to TRL 6 and facilitate transition to the USMC; provide recommendations/models for design improvement based on lessons learned; supporting the development of the IA Design Document.</p>
<p>This modification makes no change to the scope of work or the Ordering Period of the basic contract. This announcement is not a solicitation as the aforementioned contract is intended to continue under a sole source justification under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements without substantial duplication of cost to the Government."</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is "541712," with the size standard of 500 employees. This notice of intent is not a request for proposals or quotes; however, all responsible sources may submit a quotation and technical capabilities, which, if received within fifteen calendar days of publication of this notice, shall be considered by ONR. All responses must be submitted to the Government point of contact at the email address shown below. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government Contracting Office Address: Department of the Navy, Office of Naval Research (ONR), Code - ONR BD253, 875 North Randolph Street, Arlington, VA 22203-1995.</p>
<p>Government Point of Contact: Ms. Tracie Simmons, tracie.simmons@navy.mil.</p>
<p>THE INTENT OF THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. <br />NO SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED.</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is FA8601-11-T-0190 issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) and is conducted as a commercial item procurement using Simplified Acquisition Procedures (FAR Part 13).

<p>This RFQ has one line item:</p>
<p><br />CLIN Period of Performance (POP) <br />Item<br />0001 <br />1 December 2011 to 30 November 2012 The contractor shall provide all labor, facilities, transportation, services, equipment, and materials (except as identified as Government furnished) necessary to perform chemical testing of coal samples as specified in the attached Performance Work Statement (PWS) and attached Bid Schedule<br />1001<br />Option Year 1 <br />1 December 2012 to 30 November 2013 The contractor shall provide all labor, facilities, transportation, services, equipment, and materials (except as identified as Government furnished) necessary to perform chemical testing of coal samples as specified in the attached Performance Work Statement (PWS) and attached Bid Schedule<br />2001 Option Year 2 <br />1 December 2013 to 30 November 2014 The contractor shall provide all labor, facilities, transportation, services, equipment, and materials (except as identified as Government furnished) necessary to perform chemical testing of coal samples as specified in the attached Performance Work Statement (PWS) and attached Bid Schedule<br />3001 Option Year 3 <br />1 December 2014 to 30 November 2015 The contractor shall provide all labor, facilities, transportation, services, equipment, and materials (except as identified as Government furnished) necessary to perform chemical testing of coal samples as specified in the attached Performance Work Statement (PWS) and attached Bid Schedule<br />4001 Option Year 4 <br />1 December 2015 to 30 November 2016 The contractor shall provide all labor, facilities, transportation, services, equipment, and materials (except as identified as Government furnished) necessary to perform chemical testing of coal samples as specified in the attached Performance Work Statement (PWS) and attached Bid Schedule</p>
<p>Proposals must contain the following: <br />- Price quote<br />- All Requirements listed in the attached PWS<br />- Evidence of completed Representations and Certifications</p>
<p>Contractor evaluation and potential to be selected for award will also be based on the 4 following critical items to ensure contract execution and quality assurance:</p>
<p>1. ) Is the contractor able to provide 24-hr per day, 7 days/week notification capabilities? Availability - Performance Work Statement 2.2 - Very rarely it will be necessary to obtain results immediately upon completion of analysis. Additionally the base may need to get a sample to the lab on a weekend due to a problem with the equipment. Both these cases will require us to be able to obtain contact with the lab to make sure analysis gets underway immediately.</p>
<p>2.) Is the contractor familiar with each of the analytical methods listed in the PWS? Certifications/Qualifications - Performance Work Statement 4.3- Analysis of coal uses common methods that have been selected by US EPA. Due to the dusty nature of coal some labs will use methods not approved by US EPA. It is absolutely necessary for approved methods to be used for analysis of base samples.</p>
<p>3. ) Does the contractor participate in any of the laboratory accreditation programs listed in the PWS? QA/QC Sampling Qualifications - Performance Work Statement 4.4-It is important that the lab that is awarded the contract have a strong quality control program. Since there is no certification program for coal analysis, we must rely on a voluntary QC certification programs within the industry. Labs must follow procedures developed by these organizations to be considered acceptable.</p>
<p>4.) Past Experience<br />The contractor having prior experience analyzing coal is preferred. There are specific requirements for analyzing coal, such as having a room which is used solely for the coal grinding and sample preparation. The facility should have these capabilities already in place in order to handle analysis of base samples.</p>
<p>These 4 critical items that are being evaluated shall be met by the contractor and explained specifically in the Contractor's proposal. These items are required for possible consideration of an award of this service and must be explained thoroughly on how they will be met. These 4 critical items shall be provided along with the proposals turned in by the offeror.</p>

<p>Quotations shall be accompanied by a completed FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications (May 2011) (attachment 1), and adhere to FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial (June 2008). The Government's preferred method is electronic Representations and Certifications. This can be accomplished by registering in ORCA at https://orca.bpn.gov and completing the on-line Representations and Certifications.</p>

<p>(h) Multiple awards.  This award shall be made on an all or none basis.</p>
<p><br />PROPOSAL EVALUATION:  Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria.  This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations.  By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors.  All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability.  Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable.   Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a)  Technical Evaluation.  Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis.  A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical 	proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer.  Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award.  The offers shall 	be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p><br />This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b)  Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price.  All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price.  The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price.  The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c)  Past Performance Evaluation.  In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including:  reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources.  Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated.  When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements.  The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation.  <br /> (i) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information 	on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br /> (ii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer 	represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition.  An 	award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br /> (iii) The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating 	identified with corresponding definition as follows:  <br /> (A)  Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a 			high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br /> (B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an 			expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br /> (C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low 			expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br /> (E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance 			record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.  In the case 			of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past 			performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past 			performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br /> (v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest 	priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or 	lower.<br /> (vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br /> performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the 	Government.  If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any 	other offer.</p>

<p>52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (JAN 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose technically acceptable offer conforming to the solicitation is the lowest price.<br />All offers will be ranked by price and evaluated for technical acceptability starting with the low offer until the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable offer is identified. The following areas will be evaluated:</p>
<p>UPart 1 - Price:U The total evaluated price will be calculated as the sum of all Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) unit/extended prices. Offerors that provide incomplete pricing information or pricing information not in U.S. Dollars will be rated as unacceptable and not be considered for award.</p>

<p>In accordance with FAR 13.004 -- Legal Effect of Quotations the following information is provided in regards to quotations.<br />A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer.</p>
<p>The following clauses and provisions apply to this solicitation and are included either by reference or full text: <br />The full text of the FAR and DFAR can be accessed on the Internet at HUhttp://farsite.hill.af.milUH</p>

<p>(a) This solicitation may be protested to the issuing Contracting Office for decision by the Contracting Officer or by the Chief of the Regional Contracting Center if authority has been withheld. If requested, an independent review of an Agency Protest decision is available through appeal to the Principal Assistant Responsible for Contracting (PARC)/Senior Contracting Official (SCO) in accordance with FAR 33.103. A protest to C3 is a "PROTEST TO THE AGENCY," within the meaning of FAR 33.103. The C3 Agency Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within C3, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. After an interested party files an Agency Protest with the Contracting Officer and while that protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the Agency Protest, the Agency Protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>(b) An interested party may file a written protest to the Contracting Officer under the C3 Agency Protest program for contract solicitations issued by C3. Such Agency Protests are limited to objections to any of the following:</p>
<p>(1) A solicitation or other request by an agency for offers for a contract for the procurement of property or services.<br />(2) The cancellation of the solicitation or other request.<br />(3) An award or proposed award of the contract.<br />(4) A termination or cancellation of an award of the contract, if the written objection contains an allegation that the termination or cancellation is based in whole or in part on improprieties concerning the award of the contract.</p>
<p>(c) An Executive-Level Agency protest may be filed with the Contracting Officer designated in paragraph (f) of this provision for resolution of protests.</p>
<p>(d) For the purpose of filing a C3 Agency Protest, an interested party means an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract.</p>
<p>(e) An Agency Protest must include the protester's name, address and telephone number, including fax number or e-mail address; the solicitation or contract number, identity of the contracting activity and the contracting officer's name; a detailed statement of all legal and factual grounds for protest (mere disagreement with the decisions of Contracting Officers does not constitute grounds for protest), including copies of all relevant documents; a request for a ruling; and, a request for relief. All protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester and must state it is an Agency Protest for decision by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>(f) C3 Agency Protests, as defined in FAR 33.101, may be served on the Contracting Officer Kandahar Airfield (KAF) Bldg 232, Kandahar, Afghanistan by obtaining written and dated acknowledgment of receipt from SrA Karla M. Alvarado.</p>
<p>952.225-0019 COMMODITY SHIPPING INSTRUCTIONS - AFGHANISTAN (JUL 2011)</p>
<p>(a) USFOR-A FRAGO 10-200. United States Forces Afghanistan (USFOR-A) has directed that all shipments into and out of the Combined Joint Operations Area - Afghanistan (CJOA-A) be coordinated through the Defense Transportation System (DTS) in order to expedite the customs clearance process and facilitate the use of in-transit visibility for all cargo in the CJOA-A</p>
<p>(b) Information regarding the Defense Transportation System (DTS). For instructions on shipping commodity items via commercial means using DTS, see the following websites:</p>
<p>1. Defense Transportation Regulation - Part II Cargo Movement - Shipper, Trans-shipper, and Receiver Requirements and Procedures:<br />Hhttp://www.transcom.mil/dtr/part-ii/dtr_part_ii_203.pdf</p>
<p>2. Defense Transportation Regulation - Part II 4 Cargo Movement - Cargo Routing and Movement: Hhttp://www.transcom.mil/dtr/part-ii/dtr_part_ii_202.pdf</p>
<p>3. Defense Transportation Regulation - Part V - Department of Defense Customs and Border Clearance Policies and Procedures: Hhttp://www.transcom.mil/dtr/part-v/dtr_part_v_512.pdf</p>
<p>(c) Responsibilities of the vendor carrier representative, shipping expediter, and/or customs broker:</p>
<p>1. Afghanistan Import Customs Clearance Request Procedures: The carrier, shipping expediter, and/or customs broker is responsible for being knowledgeable about the Afghan Customs Clearance Procedures.<br />2. Status of Customs Clearance Requests: All inquiries regarding the status of a customs clearance request prior to its submission to Department of Defense (DoD) Customs and after its return to the carrier representative or shipping expediter should be directed to the carrier or shipping agent.<br />3. Customs Required Documents: The carrier representative or shipping expediter is required to provide the DoD Contracting Officer Representative (COR) with all documentation that will satisfy the requirements of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA).</p>
<p>(d) Required Customs Documents: Documents must be originals (or copies with a company stamp). Electronic copies or photocopied documents will not be accepted by GIRoA. The carrier is responsible for checking the current requirements for documentation with the Afghanistan Customs Department (ACD) as specified by the U.S. Embassy Afghanistan's SOP for Customs Clearance Requests Operations (Hhttp://trade.gov/static/AFGCustomsSOP.pdfH) and paragraph 4 below.</p>
<p>1. The U.S Ambassador Afghanistan diplomatic note guarantees that the U.S. Government (USG) shipments are exempt from Afghanistan Customs duties and taxes. USG shipments do not provide commercial carriers with the authority to unnecessarily delay shipments or holdover shipments in commercial storage lots and warehouses while en route to its final destination. The U.S. Embassy expects that shipments will be expedited as soon as customs clearance paperwork is received from the respective GIRoA officials.</p>
<p>2. Imports. Documentation must list the year, make, model, and color of the commodity, the commodity Identification Number (if applicable) and for vehicles, the Engine Block Number. The following documentation is required for all import shipments:</p>
<p>a. An original Customs Clearance Request (CCR) prepared by the COR in accordance with Afghanistan customs guidance referenced in paragraph 4 below.</p>
<p>b. Bills of Lading (for shipments by sea), Airway Bills (for shipments by air) or Commodity Movement Request (CMRs) (for overland shipments). In the consignee block, type in "US Military". This will help the Afghan Customs officials to recognize that the shipment belongs to the US Military and, therefore, the shipment is subject to tax exemption provisions as specified under the current Diplomatic Note or Military Technical Agreement (MTA).</p>
<p>c. Shipping Invoices.</p>
<p>d. Packing Lists. Required only if the shipping invoice does not list the cargo.</p>
<p>e. An Afghan Government Tax Exemption Form (Muaffi Nama) purchased from the Department of Customs and Revenue and prepared in the local language by the carrier representative, shipping agent, or customs broker.</p>
<p>f. A Diplomatic Note, prepared by DoD Customs, to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs requesting the initiation of customs formalities with the Ministry of Finance, Department of Customs and Exemptions. Please note that DoD Customs is not responsible for registering vehicles. <br /><br />g. Commercially-owned equipment such as vehicles, construction machinery or generators that are leased and imported to Afghanistan for the performance of a USG contract may be subject to taxes and duties as determined by GIRoA. If commercially-owned equipment is imported into Afghanistan in a duty-free status, that duty-free status only applies as long as the equipment is under the exclusive use of the USG contract. If the equipment is released at the end of the contract, applicable GIRoA duties and taxes will apply to the owner if the equipment is not exported from Afghanistan or transferred to another USG contract.</p>
<p>h. USG-owned vehicles must be exported at the conclusion of the project period or transferred to another USG entity. Under certain conditions, the USG may transfer equipment or vehicles to GIRoA.</p>
<p>3. Exports. The following documentation is required for all export shipments:</p>
<p>a. An original CCR prepared by the COR. If COR is not available, the Contracting Officer (KO) will prepare the CCR.</p>
<p>b. Invoices.</p>
<p>c. Packing Lists. Required only if the shipping invoice does not list the cargo.<br /><br />d. A Diplomatic Note, prepared by the DoD Customs Cell, to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs requesting the initiation of customs formalities with the Ministry of Finance, Department of Customs and Exemptions.</p>
<p>4. Customs requirements from the GIRoA may change with little notice. For current detailed instructions on customs guidelines in Afghanistan, refer to "The Instruction for Customs Clearance Request (Import/Export) Operations." In all cases, the carrier is required to obtain a copy of this document, found at the following link: Hhttp://trade.gov/static/AFGCustomsSOP.pdf</p>
<p>(e) Point of contact (POC) for customs issues is the USFOR-A Joint Security Office (JSO) J3 at DSN: 318-449-0306 or 449-0302. Commercial to DSN conversion from the United States is (732) 327-5130, choose option #1, and then dial 88-318 followed by your seven digit DSN number.</p>

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples.(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).(ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.(2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>The Government intends to award to the responsible offerors whose offers conforming to the solicitation that will be the most advantageous to the Government based upon LOWEST PRICED TECHNICALLY ACCEPTABLE.

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples.(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).(ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.(2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

	The RAPIDGate Program enables electronic verification of identity and access privileges at Fort McCoy?s access control points (ACPs), thereby improving security and streamlining access to the installation.
Access Privilege Management
    Companies choosing to participate in the RAPIDGate Program will have streamlined access onto the installation. Participants will have access through all gates that size permits (Main Gate, Gate 5, Gate 15 and Gate 20) and will only be subject to RANDOM vehicle inspections. At the Main Gate RAPIDGate participants will be able to utilize either lane, enabling fast access onto the installation through that gate.

To enter the installation a pass is required for each person. Currently the maximum pass period is 30 days.  Effective December 1, 2010, maximum day pass will be reduced to 14 days and on April 1, 2011 only a one day pass will be issued.  To obtain a pass, you will be required to go to Vehicle Registration at the Welcome Center, show identification (i.e. driver?s license), vehicle registration, proof of insurance, contract award letter and/or bill of lading to obtain a pass to the installation. NO PASSES WILL BE ISSUED AT THE GATE. Vehicle Registration hours are Monday ? Friday 7:30a.m. ? 4:00p.m.  Significant delays may result from choosing to access the installation by obtaining a one day pass.  In which The Government will not be held responsible for any access delays.  Contractor may not at any time request consideration as a result of choosing to access the installation using the day pass process.  
Enrollment/Registration
    Companies that service Fort McCoy may enroll in the RAPIDGate Program by calling 1-877-RAPIDGate (1-877-727-4342).  The Program will confirm with the installation that the company has legitimate business on the installation. Once the company has enrolled, its employees can register at the self-service Registration Station located at the Fort McCoy Welcome Center.
    The RAPIDGate Program confirms the individual?s employment status with the company, and then performs identity authentication and background screening.  Employees who qualify are issued a personalized RAPIDGate ID Badge.  The Program performs background screening on a regular basis to verify continued eligibility in the Program.
    Questions about the Fort McCoy RAPIDGate Program should be addressed to info@rapidgate.com with the subject line RE: RAPIDGate Program, or to the Physical Security Branch, Directorate of Emergency Services at 608-388-4694.<BR><BR>(a)  Pursuant to Department of Defense Instruction Number 2000.16, ?DoD Antiterrorism (AT) Standards,? dated October  2, 2006, each contractor employee requiring access to a Federally-controlled installation, facility and/or Federally-controlled information system(s) shall complete Level I AT Awareness Training on an annual basis and receive a certificate of completion.

Notice to Contractors: The disclosure of U.S. Government documents by third parties can result in damage to our national security.  Each contractor is obligated to protect classified information pursuant to all applicable laws and to use Government information technology systems in accordance with agency procedures so that the integrity of such systems is not compromised.
Unauthorized disclosures of classified documents (whether in print, on a blog, or on websites) do not alter the documents' classified status or automatically result in declassification of the documents.  To the contrary, classified information, whether or not already posted on public websites or disclosed to the media, remains classified, and must be treated as such by Federal employees and contractors, until it is declassified by an appropriate U.S. Government authority.  Executive Order 13526, Classified National Security Information (December 29, 2009), Section 1.1.(c) states, "Classified Information shall not be declassified automatically as a result of any unauthorized disclosure of identical or similar information."  Although the Department has taken steps to secure access to publicly published classified materials from Departmental computers, it is important to understand our continuing duties and responsibilities in this regard. 
Contractors therefore are reminded of the following obligations with respect to the treatment of classified information and the use of non-classified government information technology systems:
(a) Except as authorized by their agencies and pursuant to agency procedures, contractors shall not, while using Government issued computers or other devices (such as Blackberries or Smart Phones) access the web on non-classified Government systems, access documents that are marked classified (including classified documents made publicly available by a third party), as doing so risks that material still classified will be placed onto non-classified systems.  This requirement applies to access that occurs either through agency or contractor computers, or through employees' or contractors' personally owned computers that access non-classified Government systems.  This requirement does not restrict contractor access to non-classified, publicly available news reports (and other non-classified material) that may in turn discuss classified material, as distinguished from access to underlying documents that themselves are marked classified (including if the underlying classified documents are available on public Web sites or otherwise in the public domain).
(b) Contractors shall not access classified material unless a favorable determination of the person's eligibility for access has been made by an agency head or the agency head's designee, the person has signed and approved non-disclosure agreement, the person has a need to know the information, and the person has received contemporaneous training on the proper safeguarding of classified information and on the criminal, civil, and administrative sanctions that may be imposed on an individual who fails to protect classified information from unauthorized disclosure.
(c) Classified information shall not be removed from official premises or disclosed without proper authorization.
(d) Contractors who believe they may have inadvertently accessed or downloaded classified or sensitive information on computers that access the web via non-classified government systems, or without prior authorization, should contact their Contracting Officer immediately.
(e) Thank you for your cooperation, and for your vigilance to these responsibilities.  If you have any questions regarding handling classified documents, or the blocking of access to sites which have inappropriately posted classified materials, please contact your Contracting Officer.  It will be the Contracting Officer's responsibility to contact the appropriate Government personnel regarding these matters.
At a minimum, responsible sources shall provide the following: (1) A price quote on letterhead for the requested item(s) along with description literature on proposed items; (2) Unit Price and Extended Price; (3) Prompt payment terms; (4) Remittance address; (5) Tax I.D. Number and Duns Number.  This announcement will close at 3:00 p.m., local time, on 8/5/2011. The point of contact is Ms. Dalenna Hessling, Procurement Technician, who can be reached at 928-343-8129. Offerors shall submit their quotes via email to dhessling@usbr.gov or facsimile to 928-343-8568.

<DESC><strong>(i)</strong>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR A COMMERCIAL ITEM PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6 AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. <br /><br /><strong>(ii) </strong>Solicitation No. BBG50-R-11- 0022 is issued as a Request For Proposal (RFP) for a Firm-Fixed price purchase order that will be awarded using the contracting by negotiation procedures in FAR Part 15.<br /><br /><strong>(iii)</strong> This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect from the Federal Acquisition Regulations 2005-53, dated July 05, 2011. <br /><strong><br />(iv)</strong> This is a full and open competition. The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541720.<br /><br /><strong>(v)</strong> The contractor shall provide the following Contract Line Item (CLIN): 1. Conduct a social networking study of the following markets: Lagos, Nigeria, Cairo, Egypt, and Jakarta, Indonesia.  <br /><br /><strong>(vi)</strong> The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), International Broadcasting Bureau (IBB) Governors requires a contractor to conduct a social networking study of the following markets: Lagos, Nigeria, Cairo, Egypt, and Jakarta, Indonesia. The Broadcasting Board of Governors operates the Voice of America (VOA)  is a U.S.-based, publicly funded international broadcaster dedicated to providing objective news and information to audiences in under-served media environments around the world.  While traditionally focused on delivering its content via broadcast media, VOA is moving aggressively to expand distribution via new media platforms.  In particular, recognizing the explosive growth of social networking around the world, VOA is interesting in exploring how this phenomenon can best be used to supplement and enhance its traditional methods of content distribution.  To succeed in this effort, VOA requires a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of exactly how web and mobile-based social networking contributes to the flow of information in key markets. VOA invites interested Contractors to propose a methodological approach that will provide us with the required insight into the role of social networking in news dissemination.  The methods deployed might involve conventional qualitative research, depth interviews, ethnographic research,  the use of social media monitoring tools, mining of existing data sources, or some combination of these and other research techniques.  The ultimate attempt of this project will be to assess the current and future potential of social media as a content dissemination platform for VOA and to develop strategies that will maximize the effectiveness of these distribution methods.  The key questions to answer would be: 1. To what extent do users of social networks rely on those media for news and information? 2. What types of news and information do they most commonly obtain via social media? 3.Are social media explicitly seen as a venue to seek out news and information or is the consumption of news casual and incidental to other activity on social networks? 4. What are the specific mechanisms by which user obtain news and information via social networks? 5. To what extent do users of social networks pass on news and information to their friends and family? 6. Which types of news and information are most likely to be passed on? What specific methods/media are used to pass on news and information? 7. How does news consumption via social networks affect usage of traditional media?  Is news and information received via social networks a complement to or a substitute for traditional media? 8. To what extent do users of social networks "subscribe" to news and information; i.e. "friend" news organizations on Facebook; follow news providers or important public figures on Twitter, etc.9. What are the technical means by which users access social media  (i.e. desktop computers, mobile phone, internet cafes, etc) and what are the advantages and disadvantages of each. These questions should be considered as a starting point, with the research pursuing other related avenues of inquiry as they arise. For purposes of this study, "social media" will be defined not just to include well known platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, but also other means of electronic information sharing, such as SMS and email. The deliverables for the project are as follows; 1). For each country, a narrative report of 20-30 pages in length, addressing the main research questions cited earlier and any other significant issues that are raised in the course of the research.  Each report shall also a full description of the research methodologies employed. In the event that focus groups, depth interviews, or ethnographic techniques are employed, the contractor shall also submit full transcripts in English (or, in the case of ethnographic studies, observational logs.) and 2). a summary report, of 20 -30 pages in length providing overall conclusions based on the research and noting similarities and differences between the countries covered in the study with respect to the topics of interest. It is expected that the Contractor will submit drafts of all of the above-mentioned deliverables for comment by VOA prior to the issuance of the final reports. <br /><br /><strong>(vii)</strong> The Period of Performance is four months after award.

<p>The Food and Drug Administration is soliciting quotes for an X-ray (XRF) spectrometry capable of detecting metals in drugs at the part per million (ppm) level. This technology can be used to identify metal impurities in pharmaceutical materials that can reduce the shelf life of pharmaceutical products. The technical requirements are:</p>
<p>1) The instrument must be small enough to sit on a typical laboratory bench.<br />2) The instrument should only require 110 volt power, 15 amps. The instrument should be air cooled and not require cooling water or liquid nitrogen for operation. <br />3) The instrument must be capable of measuring x-ray fluorescence from elements Sodium through Uranium.<br />4) The instrument must be capable of measuring a variety of samples including loose powders, pressed tablets, capsules, liquids, suspensions, etc.<br />5) Ideally the instrument will be capable of single part per million detection limits for cadmium, arsenic, lead and mercury in a variety of matrices.<br />6) The instrument must use an x-ray tube source capable of supporting X-ray fluorescence measurement of high Z elements including palladium, Ruthenium, rhodium, osmium, iridium and platinum. The x-ray tube should generate at least 50 watts of radiation, and have an operating voltage that can reach at least 50 kilovolts.<br />7) The instrument detector must be capable of collecting and analyzing x-rays at high count rates, exceeding 100,000 x-ray counts per second. This is required to increase signal-to-noise ratio and decrease measurement time.<br />8) The instrument must have an energy dispersive detector with a bandwidth not to exceed 150 eV full width at half maximum, measured at the manganese K-alpha line at a signal rate of not less than 100,000 counts per second. This is required to reduce overlap of nearby peaks in the XRF spectrum, and thereby improve the quantitative accuracy and detection limit of the instrument.<br />9) A pertinent measure of detection limit and bandwidth capability can be demonstrated by the following procedures, which tests the capability of the instrument to measure lead in the presence of a large bismuth background;<br />(a) Measure and report the unprocessed XRF spectrum of 10 ml of liquid Pepto Bismol (Original Strength) over the 9 - 15 keV spectral range using a 5 minute integrated collection time.<br />(b) Measure and report the unprocessed XRF spectrum of 10 ml of liquid Pepto Bismol (Original Strength) spiked with 0.2 ml of a 10,000 part per million lead standard solution over the 9 - 15 keV spectral range using a 5 minute integrated collection time.<br />(c) Report the difference spectrum between (b) and (a) without smoothing.<br />(d) Measure and report the unprocessed XRF spectrum of 10 ml of liquid Pepto Bismol (Original Strength) spiked with 0.02 ml of a 10,000 part per million lead standard solution over the 9 - 15 keV spectral range using a 5 minute integrated collection time.<br />(e) Report the difference spectrum between (d) and (a) without smoothing. The detection limit will be determined from the difference spectra ((c) and (e) above ad the extrapolated concentration that results in a signal-to-noise ration of 3, the signal being measured as the peak of the lead 10.5 keV line, and the noise being measured as the root mean squared average noise of the spectrum.<br />10) The instrument must have user-control of source voltage and current.<br />11) The instrument must have an automated sample holder that automatically advances to the next sample after a measurement is complete, with at least 12 positions for 12 separate samples. Additional sample carrousels with fewer positions that allow measurement of larger samples may also be included.<br />12) Instrument must have at least 5 secondary targets and source polarization elements, to support sensitive measurement of elements from sodium through uranium. The instrument must be able to automatically switch between secondary targets during a typical measurement of a single sample to cover all elements.<br />13) The instrument must have a facility to purge the region between the sample, detector and x-ray tube with nitrogen or helium.<br />14) The instrument must include a complete computer system (e.g., computer, monitor, mouse, keyboard, etc.) required for operation, including instrument control software and software to develop calibration models based on fundamental parameters and empirical parameters.<br />15) The software should be user friendly and easy to operate. Facilities to develop qualitative and quantitative methods and standardless semiquantitative methods are desirable.<br />16) The instrument must include radiation shielding and safety interlocks that protect the user from exposure to x-ray radiation.<br />17) Price should include one year parts and labor warranty.<br />18) Price should include installation and on site training. Installation must include installation qualification and operational qualification (IQ/OQ).<br />19) Price should include any cost for shipping and handling.</p>
<p>TRADE AND SERVICE CRITERIA:</p>
<p>1. The instrument must be new, neither a demonstration model nor a refurbished instrument. The life cycle of this instrument is intended to be greater than ten years at full performance. The Food and Drug Administration must be able to reasonably expect service and technical support from the vendor during its lifecycle.<br />2. The instrument must have one (1) year of warranty and support from the date of installation. The vendor shall provide a copy and pricing for any available extended warranties and service contracts. The vendor must be also capable of servicing the accessory through the period of any purchased extended warranty or service contract. This information shall not obligate the FDA to purchase an extended warranty.<br />3.

This contract will consist of a single launch withpotential extension at the Governments discretion to up to four additional launches. LSPrequires a launch service provider with proven flight experience and a rocket capable ofboth launch and safe return of Nano-Satellite payloads in order to collect/analyze NASAexperimental data. The goal of this project is to provide high altitude flights toCubeSats in order to demonstrate new technologies before space flight. Background: The NASA Launch Services Program (LSP) is investigating the feasibility of a missionwhich consists of launching a Poly-Picosatellite Orbital Deployer (P-POD) with up to 31U Nano-Satellites and four individual 1U Nano-Satellites. The Nano-Satelliteslocated within the P-POD will require the ability to be ejected at a designated pointduring flight. The remaining four 1U Nano-Satellites will be secured throughout flightwithout need for ejection capability.The P-POD provides a standard interface between picosatellite class satellites and alaunch vehicle. The purpose of the P-POD is to act as an interface between thepicosatellites (also known as CubeSats) and the launch vehicle, as well as a deploymentsystem for the CubeSats. The P-POD utilizes a tubular design and can hold up to 34cm x10cm x 10cm of hardware. The most common configuration is three CubeSats of equal size(typically 10 cm cubes with a mass of less than 1 kg); however, the capability exists tointegrate picosatellites of different lengths. The tubular design creates a predictablelinear trajectory for the picosatellites resulting in a low spin rate upon deployment.The satellites are deployed from the P-POD by means of a spring, and glide along smoothflat rails as they exit the P-POD. After a signal is sent from the launch vehicle, aspring-loaded door is opened and the picosatellites are deployed by the main spring.Ground Rules and Assumptions:1)	The Contractor shall provide a payload section capable of accommodating up to20Kgs of NASA payload consisting of the following:a.	One P-POD with up to 3 1U CubeSats and 4 individual 1U CubeSats; andb.	Harness and Telemetry hardware.2)	The Contractor shall be responsible for attaining all required approvalsnecessary for launch.3)	Successful operation of the Contractors Launch Vehicle shall not be inhibited byNASA payloads being powered on and transmitting RF to a level of 5 watts output prior toand during flight.4)	The Contractor shall designate to the Government a sufficient area on the body ofthe rocket to affix NASA-provided decals. (Details of the specifications of these decalswill be determined after award through agreement between the Government and theContractor.)5)	The Contractor shall be able to accommodate a T-0 disconnect with a minimum of 12wired connectors.6)	The Contractor shall provide support (e.g., telemetry, internet access, andphone) on launch day at the launch site facility for at minimum two (2) NASA-specifiedpersonnel and provide an upper limit for the total number of personnel the Contractor cansupport on launch day at that facility7)	The Government will be responsible for the Nano-Satellites originally containedin the P POD after they are ejected from the launch vehicle.8)	The Government plans to broadcast the launch during an educational webcast toschools throughout the US. The launch countdown needs to be flexible to accommodate thewebcast. Task Description The Contractor shall provide a launch vehicle with at minimum one successful previouslaunch. In the proposal the Contractor shall provide the Government with flight data(either telemetered or recovered) from previous launch attempts and insight into theLaunch Vehicle propulsion system design that will be used on the contracted mission(s). A firm fixed price for the first flight with four (4) options of one (1) additionalflight per option shall be priced by the Contractor. Options for the additional flightsshall be priced based on a flight rate of one launch every 6 to 12 month.  Contractedflight(s) shall occur within 12 months from Authorization to Proceed (ATP).  As aseparate price, the Contractor shall provide prices for the same flights where ejectionof Nano-Satellites contained in the P-POD is not required.   Deliverables:1)	The Contractor shall deliver a schedule including, but not limited to, launchlocation processing time and mission integration milestones. 2)	The Contractor shall deliver the rocket payload section to the Government foroffsite integration of the P-POD and Nano-Satellites no less than 60 days prior to thespecified launch date.3)	The Contractor shall provide a launch vehicle instrumented in a manner to ensuredata recovery in the case of a contingency during flight (e.g., telemetered, protectedrecoverable recording device). 4)	The Contractor shall provide a launch vehicle capable of reaching a minimumlaunch altitude of 15 thousand feet.5)	The launch vehicle shall provide command for turn on of the Nano-Satellites priorto liftoff, a minimum of six pairs.6)	The Contractor shall provide video of major flight events in a format that iscapable of being streamed via the web in real-time (e.g., liftoff, separation of stages(if designed with staging), ejection of Nano-Satellites from P-POD, deployment ofparachute or other recovery devices, etc.).7)	The Contractor shall provide video of major flight events in a format that isdigitally recorded and delivered to the NASA POC within five (5) working days of launch(e.g., liftoff, separation of stages (if designed with staging), ejection ofNano-Satellites from P-POD, deployment of parachute or other recovery devices, etc.).8)	The payload section shall be designed so that a P-POD can eject its CubeSats at adesignated point during flight.9)	The Contractor shall provide a post flight data package to include collected datafrom the mission.Period of Performance:	The initial period of performance shall be September 1, 2011,through September 1, 2012, but may be extended if the Government exercises any of thefour (4) optional launches.NASA Technical Points of Contact:NASA Mission Manager	Garrett L.

Contractors shall first meet the above minimum technical factors and then will be evaluated on the technical factors. Related maintenance items, B.2, are a large portion of the total cost of the contract and although they may change slightly from year to year, they will stay relatively constant. Therefore the maintenance items in B.2 for the initial aircraft, N56RF, will be used for the purpose of contract evaluation .

This may include percent of discount or markup on parts, labor rates, time availability for services required, and other technical factors. All responsible quoters may submit a response to this notice that will be considered by the agency.</p>

A determination by the Government to not compete this proposed effort on a full and open competitive basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.
 Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by the agency.  
 
FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items is applicable to this procurement.  
(a)  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers.

(i) TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED ITEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT
(ii) PAST PERFORMANCE
(iii) PRICE

Offerors' proposals will be evaluated first under Factor (i) above, which represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.
  Under this factor, products offered will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the offer to be technically unacceptable and to not be considered for award.  See paragraph (b) below.

Only those Offers which meet the minimum requirements established by Factor (i) and delineated in the attached Minimum Specification Sheet will be further evaluated under Factors (ii) and (iii).  In the second step of evaluating the offers determined under Factor (i) to be technically acceptable, Factor (ii), PAST PERFORMANCE, all combined with factor (i) is approximately of equal importance with Factor (iv), PRICE.

At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.
  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offeror's best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.   

(b)  TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED ITEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT, Factor (i), will be assessed by evaluating technical information submitted in response to this solicitation.  Offerors' technical information will be used to determine whether the items or services proposed meet the specifications included in this solicitation.  Items or services offered, as provided in Offerors' technical information, will be evaluated and determined to be either technically acceptable or technically unacceptable.  Offers which are determined to be technically unacceptable may not be considered further for award.
 

(c)  Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE information will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years. 

PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation.  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources who may have relevant information. 

Offers which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any Offeror's proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors.

The Contracting Officer will evaluate Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE as follows:

NEUTRAL:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.
  Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor.

SATISFACTORY:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offeror's past performance.

UNSATISFACTORY:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offeror's past performance.

(d)  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.
  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Quoters must be registered in the CCR database to be considered for award. Registration is free and can be completed on-line at http://www.ccr.gov/ . 

Additional instruction to offerors: Offers must include following:
(1)	Signed priced offer on company letterhead (see FAR 52.212-1) with point of contact information, DUNS, Cage Code, business size/type, and payment terms.
(2)	List of technical specification and photos of products being offered providing enough detail for proper evaluation by Technical Evaluation Board; 
(3)	Past performance information  i.e.
 contracts of similar volume/products completed in the past 3 years; include POC information.
(4)	Completed FAR Clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR) SUBPART 12.6 "SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS", AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.This solicitation number is RFQ-RT-11-00132 and is being issued as a full and open competition Request for Quotation (RFQ) using FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  This effort will support the US EPA National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory (NHEERL). The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code: 541380- Testing Laboratories, which has a Small Business Size Standard of $12 million. The United State Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to award a contract for the Integrated Systems Toxicology Division within NHEERL.  General: The contractor shall perform chemical analyses (for the 75 analytes listed below in Table 1) on drinking water samples for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory, Integrated Systems Toxicology Division, 109 T.W. Alexander Drive, Research Triangle Park, N.C. 27709 (heretofore, referred as the government).  The government w ill provide initial water samples for this project over a period of approximately 9-10 months, with options to obtain further analyses after the base period. This work is part of a collaborative project called the Four Lab Study, which involves treatment of drinking water, concentration of this drinking water, chemical analysis of disinfection by-products (DBPs) formed in the water, and toxicological study of the drinking water concentrates. This contract will be to carry out chemical analysis.  The contractor shall measure 75 priority DBPs in several types of water samples:  the underlying source water (1x),  1x disinfected water, source water concentrated by reverse osmosis (nondisinfected RO),  nondisinfected RO samples further processed by lyophilizatization/freeze-drying  (nondisinfected LY),  RO concentrates treated with chlorine, RO concentrates treated with chloramines,  LY concentrates treated with  chlorine, and LY concentrates treated with chloramines. The concent rates are expected to have DBPs at concentrations between 100 and 400-fold greater than the 1x water from which they will be derived.  Methods for these non-regulated priority DBPs can be found on the U.S. EPA-ERD website at www.epa.gov/athens/publications/DBP.html and as described in Pressman et al., 2010 (Environmental Science and Technology, 2010 (Oct); 44(19):7184-92). To meet data quality objectives, it is critical that the DBPs be measured in one laboratory; this increases the ability to develop quantitative understanding of the relative proportions of the chemicals. The overall experimental objectives of this project are 1) to develop integrated chemical and toxicological assessments of water concentrates prepared by various methods (RO and LY); 2) to develop an understanding of the impact of disinfection scenarios on DBP formation and toxicity; and 2) to develop an understanding of the impact of seasonal effects (winter, spring, summer, fall) on both the DBPs formed  and on the in vitro toxicity of the DBP concentrates. Government Furnished Items: The government will provide water samples collected and stored in appropriate containers (the government pays the cost of shipping water samples overnight to the contractor).   Based on the availability of commercially available standards, the government will provide a minimum of 10 chemical standards; supplying more than 10 standards will be at the convenience of the government. Specific Phases: The contractor shall perform chemical analyses on drinking water samples (1x raw and treated water, treated water concentrates, and raw water concentrates).  The contractor shall provide concentration data for the 75 listed chemical analytes for these water samples. The contractor shall perform the chemical analyses for each specific analyte within the specified holding time for that analyte. The contractor will be provided the sample within 24 hours of collection. Concentration data for samples shall  be provided to EPA within 45 working days of receipt of the samples. To meet data quality objectives, it is critical that each DBP be measured only in one laboratory. SPECIFIC PHASES WITHIN THE STATEMENT OF WORK: Phase 1 is for the QA plan. Phases 2, 3, 4 and 5 are for analysis of subsets of the water concentrates and Phase 6 is for the report on the analysis of the complete set of water concentrates. Phase 1: Within 4 weeks of award of the contract, the contractor shall develop a QA plan that includes the operating procedures (OPs) for analysis of the 75 chemicals. The draft deliverable shall be submitted to the U.S. EPA within 4 weeks of the date of contract award.   It shall include a draft Excel data spread sheet for entry and reporting of the data. After receipt of the draft deliverable, a conference call/meeting (based upon the geographic location of the contractor and the convenience of EPA) shall be scheduled between EPA and the contractor.  This call shall be at a m utually convenient time.  The EPA will provide, at least 5 working days in advance of this call/meeting, comments on the draft deliverable.  At the meeting/call, the EPA will clarify any issues or questions that the contractor has with regard to the EPA comments and the contractor will be able to clarify any questions that have arisen due to EPA comments on the work plan.  All reports shall be sent to the EPA project officer via e-mail. Phase 2: Phase 2 is for the chemical analysis of a subset of the total samples to be provided, of up to 9 water samples. The U.S. EPA shall notify the contractor a minimum of 3 weeks in advance of the expected date of sample delivery.  Paying careful attention to the holding time of the each analyte, the contractor shall analyze the provided samples for the 75 chemicals listed in Table 1. Phase 3: Phase 3 is for the chemical analysis of a subset of the total samples to be provided, of up to 9 water samples. The U.S. EPA shall notify the contr actor a minimum of 3 weeks in advance of the expected date of sample delivery.   Paying careful attention to the holding time of the each analyte, the contractor shall analyze the provided samples for the 75 chemicals listed in Table 1. Phase 4: Phase 4 is for the chemical analysis of a subset of the total samples to be provided, of up to 9 water samples. The U.S. EPA shall notify the contractor a minimum of 3 weeks in advance of the expected date of sample delivery.  Paying careful attention to the holding time of the each analyte, the contractor shall analyze the provided samples for the 75 chemicals listed in Table 1. Phase 5: Phase 5 is for the chemical analysis of a subset of the total samples to be provided, of up to 9 water samples. The U.S. EPA shall notify the contractor a minimum of 3 weeks in advance of the expected date of sample delivery.  Paying careful attention to the holding time of the each analyte, the contractor shall analyze the provided samples for the  75 chemicals listed in Table 1. Phase 6: Phase 6 is the essential task of providing the report out of the data from the analyses of the water samples. The draft report shall be provided to the U.S. EPA within 30 working days of receipt of the last set of water samples. The report will include the data spreadsheet and copies of SOPs, the raw data, and QC data such as calibration curves.  Please note that electronic copies are preferred.   The U.S. EPA shall provide comments, if any, on the draft data report within 20 working days of receipt of the report (the U.S. EPA shall notify the contractor if they will be out of the office for an extended period of time, which shall move the date for providing comments to the contractor forward for that period of time). After receipt of the draft deliverable, a conference call/meeting (based upon the geographic location of the contractor and the convenience of EPA) will be scheduled between EPA and the contractor.  This call shall be at  a mutually convenient time.  The EPA will provide, at least 5 working days in advance of this call/meeting, comments on the draft deliverable.  At the meeting/call, the EPA will clarify any issues or questions that the contractor has with regard to the EPA comments and the contractor will be able to clarify any questions that have arisen due to EPA comments on the work plan.  All reports are to be sent to the EPA project officer via e-mail.  Basic Effort: Prior to providing the Phase 1 samples, water concentrates will be supplied to the contractor so that they may become familiar with analysis of concentrated samples (it is anticipated that this will occur in the summer of 2011). The  project will involve the analysis of four sets of water samples (including duplicates or  triplicates) of the following types: (1) the underlying source water (1x),  (2) 1x water treated with chlorine, (3) 1x water treated with chloramines, (4) source water concentrated by reverse osmosis (non disinfected RO),  (5) nondisinfected RO samples further processed by lyophilizatization/freeze-drying  (nondisinfected LY),  (6) RO concentrates treated with chlorine, (7) RO concentrates disinfected by chloramines,  (8) LY concentrates treated with chlorine, and (9) LY concentrates treated with chloramines.  No more than 9 samples will be supplied per set.  A total of 4 sets of samples will comprise the base period.   No more than 9 types of water samples will be included in each set.  The number of replicates per set depends on the number of water samples in each set, so that the total number of extractions does not exceed 18 per analyte per set of samples.  For example, when 9 types of water samples are included in the set, the samples will be run in duplicate; if 6 types of water samples are included in the set, the samples will be run in triplicate.   The number of types of water samples included in each set (up to 9 maximum) will depend on the availability of samples a nd sufficient water volume. Upon request by the government representative, the contractor shall allow an onsite visit to the laboratory. Table 1.  List of 75 Chemicals to be Analyzed can be located on page 4 of the SOW. The Government intends to award a firm fixed purchase order for a twenty-four (24) month period of performance for 72 replicates.

<p>LENEL BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION<br />Contract line item numbers (CLINs) 0001-0006 are Lenel brand name only requirements. Lenel systems currently exist to control and monitor access to the agency's main complex/buildings and outlying facilities. As a result, additional equipment must be Lenel brand components to ensure compatibility and interoperability. To introduce a different system would require the purchase, installation, and integration of many additional components, thereby increasing the overall cost of installation and maintenance of this system.</p>
<p>PANASONIC BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION<br />Contract line item numbers (CLINs) 0007-0014 and 0025 are Panasonic brand name only requirements. Replacement security cameras are needed to correspond with existing Panasonic controllers and software currently operating at the agency. Other security cameras are not adaptable to the existing installations. Using a different manufacturer would require modifications (cutting, drilling) of camera housings, controllers and head-end equipment which in turn would void warrantees to current equipment configurations and original installation.</p>
<p>BOSCH BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION<br />Contract line item numbers (CLINs) 0015-0016 and 0020 are Bosch brand name only requirements. The Bosch closed circuit television equipment is critical to security operations in Woodlawn, MD. Proprietary software and protocol for communication, programming and operation of the equipment such as camera control pan/tilt, preset, and alarm functions are unique to the existing Bosch installation. This equipment is to be used as direct replacement of existing Bosch equipment.</p>
<p>INTERNATIONAL FIBER BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION<br />Contract line item numbers (CLINs) 0018 and 0019 are International Fiber brand name only requirements. These fiber modules are to be used to maintain and repair several antiquated cameras which are currently installed at various locations around the headquarters facility. Because these cameras and all associated hardware are no longer manufactured, we have been able to determine that this fiber module is currently the only one that is available and compatible with these cameras. This has been verified through the manufacturers of both the camera and the fiber modules. We have also verified this through actual implementation. If any other modules were to be ordered, they would prove incompatible. <br /><br />APC BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION<br />Contract line item numbers (CLINs) 0023-0024 are APC brand name only requirements. APC components are certified and approved for use with the master security control system. APC supplies are essential to protect the agency's interest during power outages. To introduce different system components would require the purchase, installation, testing, and integration of many additional components, thereby increasing the overall cost of installation and maintenance of this system.</p>
<p>HES BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION<br />Contract line item number (CLIN) 0022 is an HES brand name only requirement. HES brand "strikes"/access control devices are currently installed at the agency. Physical continuity of security installations demands HES brand.</p>
<p>SDC EM BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION<br />Contract line item number (CLIN) 0027 is an SDC brand name only requirement. SDC brand locks are currently installed at the agency. Physical continuity of security installations demands SDC brand.</p>
<p>ITMC BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION<br />Contract line item number (CLIN) 0028 is an ITMC brand name only requirement. ITMC brand locks are currently installed at the agency. Physical continuity of security installations demands ITMC brand.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>Intent to Sole Source a Sapphire Laser

The Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 1 Network Contracting Activity intends to negotiate a sole source procurement, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, with Newport Corporation, 3635 Peterson Way, Santa Clara, CA 95044. The NAICS code is 333352 and the size standard is 500 employees

This notice of intent is NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.

Interested parties that can provide similar services or equal product must submit their technical specifications of product services, past performance information, price and delivery time, detailing how their services meet VA requirements to the contract specialist via e-mail. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All responses must be received NLT August 2nd , 2011 @ 1:00PM/EST USA. E-mail: James.Kneeland@VA.Gov

Salient Characteristics:
Completely automated one-box mode-locked Ti:Sapphire laser source with DeepSee dispersion compensation

Salient features include:

"	350 nm (690-1040 nm) in useable tuning range for efficient excitation of all commonly used fluorophores
"	Over 2.5 W of average power and a pulse width of less than 100 fs to obtain the most fluorescence signals.
"	pre-compensation which corrects in advance for the dispersion of the optical setup allowing the maximum fluorescence signals to be observed
"	excellent beam quality and pointing stability to preserve the critical alignment to the sample
"	ultra-stable regenerative mode locking for hands-free, dropout free wavelength tuning
"	real-time monitoring of the laser system to maintain beam position, average power, and wavelength
"	Compact design to maximize valuable table space
"	Deeper penetration depths without risk of sample damage from increased average powers

Statutory Authority: 
FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 

Unique Qualifications:
This state-of-the-art laser is an integral part of our multiphoton/confocal microscope which allows investigators at the VA Boston Healthcare System to gain a deeper understanding of the complex mechanisms involved in the regulation of many organ systems at the molecular, cellular and tissue levels. This upgrade encompasses a completely automated one-box mode-locked titanium-sapphire laser source with DeepSee dispersion compensation. The laser has a wide tuning range and high average power. The high negative group velocity dispersion at all wavelengths provide shortest pulses and most fluorescence at the sample.  

The original laser for our highly specialized multiphoton imaging system was purchased from Newport Corporation, a company that manufactures specialized lasers.  To meet the technical needs of our imaging system, the new laser requires specific design criteria that can only be met by the laser available from Newport Corporation. This includes unique mode-locking technology that will enable continuous wavelength tuning with zero re-optimization time and real time excitation fingerprinting in seconds. The cost of the laser includes a trade-in credit for our older model laser.  The value of this trade-in would not be recovered by the government through competition since Newport made the original laser.

Contracting Office Address: 
Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 1 Brockton Office, 940 Belmont Street, Brockton, Ma 02301

Place of Performance:

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples.(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159.

The overall objective is to create an evolutionary-future environment where employees are engaged and encouraged to take a leadership role in identifying and solving problems that benefit the procurement workforce, the customer and the FBI's mission needs.
<p>In order to create this environment the FBI PS believes that contracting professionals must not only have technical competence and broad contracting experience; but they must also demonstrate: <br />- Leader Competence<br />- Business Acumen<br />- Networking and Interpersonal Skills<br />- Customer Relationship Skills<br />- Embracing Accountability<br />- Listening Skills <br />- Coaching and Change Management Skills<br />- Communications Skills<br />- Sense of Community - with all players in the Acquisition Process<br />- Mutual Valuing</p>
<p>These values should be reflected in the PDP through all of the courses taught so that the contracting professional may hone their abilities as a competent and successful business professional, FBI mission partner and leader. The courses should be specifically tailored to provide skill set advancement for all contracting professionals in varying experience levels and background.</p>
<p>Tier 1: Entry-Level<br />The FBI PS has identified three tiers in which these courses should be grouped. The First Tier (Tier 1) will provide the path for contracting professionals who are in the beginner to novice phase of their profession. These entry level courses, taught to GS 7-11 contracting professionals, will reflect the values listed above, and provide a leadership foundation that the CO and CS will take with them throughout their career. Themes should be focused on what and why more than how.</p>
<p>Tier 2: Mid-Level<br />The Second Tier (Tier 2) will provide the skills needed for those contracting professionals who are beginning to come into their own as FBI leaders. These courses will be taught to GS 12-14 contracting professionals, and will reflect the values above, with an emphasis on mission value. The courses in this tier should provide the contracting professional with not only what and why, but the how, and provide these professionals the ability to take ownership of their skills. The courses should also reflect a participant input into learning about and developing their own leadership style. The Tier 2 professional should be approached in a manner consistent with their previous experience, with a lens towards the future challenges of becoming a true leader within the FBI.</p>
<p>Tier 3: Senior Level<br />The Third Tier (Tier 3) training will provide awareness for the experienced contracting professionals, who have been in a leadership role for some years, to shape those leaders coming in and provide the skills necessary to provide daily guidance to future leaders. Tier 3 contracting professionals will be GS-15 professionals who have provided the government with years of service in either a leadership or professional role. The courses in this tier should provide the contracting professional with the ability to pass on their skills, and foster an environment in which budding contracting professionals are encouraged to take ownership of their responsibilities and provide opportunities for the leaders of the future to develop and move into future roles. Themes should have a high-level focus, with a view towards the future of FBI contracting and creating an environment and legacy of success.</p>

<DESC>Project objective is to improve survival of bypassed fish returned to the river by relocating the juvenile bypass outfall pipe to a location with improved hydraulic conditions and thus reducing predation opportunity. Generally, the project will consist of connecting a 36" pipe (variable materials) to the existing bypass system line and extending it approximately 2100' downstream and 500' into the river. There are several connections and rerouting required. A good portion of the pipe will be buried HDPE, but some portion will be supported steel pipe over ground and over water. Specifically, work consists of replacing or extending the following; a primary 36 inch pipe for fish by-passed around the Juvenile Fish Facility (JFF), a 12 inch pipe connection to the 36 inch primary line for fish routed through the facility and released back to the river, a 16 inch adult line connection to the 36 inch primary line at the facility, and a 24 inch supply line connection, again to the 36 inch primary pipe, near the facility. <br /><br />Structural support of the pipe system includes the following:<br />1. Support approximately 200 feet at an average elevation of approximately 15 feet above grade of the 36 inch primary diversion steel pipe filled with water for fish transport. These supports will be a combination of some new steel structures and some existing structure. Steel supports for the 36 inch line will occur at approximately 50 feet on center. The supports will be founded on concrete footings. Shallow excavations will be required to set the concrete footings. <br />2. The Steel pipe will transition to buried HDPE. Support of a 36 inch diameter HDPE pipe for a distance of approximately 2400 feet by burial at a base of pipe elevation averaging 8 feet below grade. In some instances the pipe is at 0 ft deep and will require earthen berms. Excavation, backfill, compaction, grade preparation and laying of the pipe will meet Corps criteria and specifications. <br />3. The Primary line will transition back to a 36" steel pipe, turn 90 degrees and route toward the river. Support of the 36" inch diameter steel pipe will be approximately 500 feet over water on steel supports. The steel supports will consist of single, cased, reinforced concrete shafts - spaced approximately 50 - 55 feet on center. Each shaft will be on average 80' long and extend to bedrock. Initially, the 48 inch diameter steel casings will be drilled through a silt layer and driven to a depth of ten feet into the bedrock. Drilling will proceed approximately ten feet beyond the base of the casing. A rebar cage will be placed down into the casing. Tremie concrete will be placed into the casing from the base of the hole drilled into the bedrock continuing all the way up, filling the voids within the rebar cage and between the cage and the wall of the casing.<br />4. In addition to the Primary 36 inch line the work will require supports for 520 feet of a 12-inch pvc pipe connection to the 36 inch primary line for fish routed through the facility and released back to the river. Steel supports for the 12 inch line will occur at approximately 50 feet on center. The supports will be founded on concrete footings. Shallow excavations will be required to set the concrete footings. <br />5. An existing 14 inch adult fish line at the facility will be replaced with a 16 inch adult fish line and will require no additional supports<br />6. Finally, approximately 200 feet of a 24-inch supply line will be rerouted and connected to the 36 inch primary outfall. Steel supports for the 24 inch line will occur at approximately 50 feet on center. The supports will be founded on concrete footings. Shallow excavations will be required to set the concrete footings.<br /><br />General: <br />1. The total length of pipe is approximately 3100 feet. The pipe must closely follow a defined slope and horizontal alignment from the tie-in points at the Juvenile Fish Facility to the outfall point some 500 feet from shore.<br />2. All pipes supported above grade will have ring girder type saddle supports. Expansion joints will be provided in the piping and thermal forces will be accommodated in the structures. <br />3. All structural steel will meet Corps criteria and AISC guidelines, specifications and standard practices. Shop drawings will be required.<br />4. All concrete work will meet Corps criteria and ACI guidelines, specifications and standard practices. Reinforcing shop drawings will be required.<br />5. All welding shall be done by certified welders meeting AWS D1.1 and Corps criteria. <br />6. All piling will meet Corps criteria and specifications.<br />7. Location of all existing structures and utilities which may be affected by the work will be verified by the contractor. All known information on these items will be supplied by the Corps.<br />8. Existing sod and irrigation lines impacted by pipeline installation will be repaired to restore Lower Monumental Dam Park area to conditions similar to pre-construction conditions.<br />9. The construction period is anticipated to begin in October 2011. The contract will contain strict schedule requirements to complete the work by March 2012. Work conditions include elevated work and work over water. Work will probably also require support of a barge-mounted crane.

<DESC>The nature of the project requirements described in the Statement of Work (SOW) does not contain precise specifications to warrant a fixed-priced mechanism.&nbsp; Further, difficulty in estimating costs with accuracy does not lend this requirement to a fixed-price mechanism.&nbsp; Therefore, a cost reimbursement type contract is appropriate for this acquisition.&nbsp; Sufficient safeguards will be included in the contract to ensure that costs are allowable, allocatable, fair, and reasonable.

<DESC>Originator's Code: CC5<br />Purchase Request Number: <br />JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br />Limited Source/Brand Name
<p>Upon the basis of the following justification, I, as the Contracting Officer, hereby approve the use of other than full and open competition of the proposed contractual action pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION</p>
<p>1. Agency and Contracting Activity:<br />Requiring Agency:<br />Defense Information Systems Agency<br />PEO-C2C, CC5<br />Ft. Meade, MD 20755-7090</p>
<p>Contracting:<br />Defense Information Systems Agency <br />Fort Meade, MD 20755</p>
<p>2. NATURE/DESCRIPTION OF ACTION(S): (FAR 6.303-2(a) (2)). Procurement of maintenance renewal for existing F5 BIG-IP software maintenance in support of the C2 Systems Engineering &amp; Integration Division for the Program Executive Office Command and Control Capabilities (PEO C2C).</p>
<p>This will be a firm fixed price acquisition for F5 BIG-IP maintenance support. This action is limited to a specific renewal maintenance support.</p>
<p>3. Description of Supplies/Services: (FAR 6.303-2(a) (3)). This requirement entails the procurement of maintenance renewal for existing F5 BIG-IP maintenance support. This software is an integral part of numerous C2 SE&amp;I efforts.</p>
<p>The total estimated cost of the proposed acquisition is $XX,XXX.XX using FY11 O&amp;MN funds. The initial procurment was awarded 13 May 2009.</p>
<p>4. Identification of Statutory Authority: Open Market: Acquisition using other than full and open competition under the authority of 10 U.S.C2304(c)(1), and the regulatory authority is FAR 6.302-1.</p>
<p>5. DEMONSTRATION OF CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS: The software licenses are critical components in ensuring the success of the program and expired 6 April 2010. The purpose of C2 SE&amp;I is to provide technical leadership and support for the accomplishment of systems engineering and integration (SE&amp;I) activities for DISA's internal/external Joint Command and Control (C2) roles to include: architecture, requirements analysis, functional analysis, integration, SE Process, technical/design reviews, configuration management, information assurance, testing, technical experiments/investigations, and capability deployment in support of the PEO C2C efforts to deliver continuous C2 enhancements to the Warfighter.</p>
<p>The BIG-IP Local Traffic Manager (F5-BIG-LTM-6400-4GB-RS - F5 BIG-IP Local Traffic Manager 6400 v9 - load balancing device) is an application traffic management system that provides an intelligent and adaptable solution to secure, optimize and deliver applications. The system features a set of unified application infrastructure services that deliver total control, vision and flexibility into application security, performance and delivery. <br />F5 Networks BIG-IP Switch: Local Traffic Manager 6900 8GB FIPS (Max TPS) - Application Intelligence and Control - delivers complete application fluency-enabling network-speed full payload inspection and programmable event-based traffic management to understand and act upon application flows.</p>
<p>If this support is not acquired we will not be able to ensure that the PEO's Joint C2 Initiatives and supported programs (e.g., JPES and GCCS-J) will be able to continue to field militarily-useful, well-integrated, interoperable, and performant capabilities to the Warfighter. This software license maintenance renewal will continue to provide the C2 SE&amp;I with the software capability needed to ensure that the PEO's Joint C2 Initiatives and supported programs (e.g., JPES and GCCS-J) continue to field militarily-useful, well-integrated, interoperable, and performant capabilities to the Warfighter.<br />Without the required F5 licenses/support we can not balance the work load among multiple servers and the degradation of performance will be experienced among the user community.</p>
<p>6. FEDBIZOPPS ANNOUNCEMENT/POTENTIAL SOURCES: The F5 BIG-IP maintenance renewal will be purchased directly from F5 authorized resllers. Synopsis is not required IAW FAR 5.202(a)(10), proposed contract action is made under conditions described in 6.302-5(a)(2)(ii) with regard to brand name commercial items for authorized resale, and advance notice is not appropriate or reasonable.</p>
<p>7. DETERMINATION OF FAIR AND REASONABLE COST: (FAR 6.303-2(a) (7)). The Contracting Officer will make a determination that the anticipated cost for this acquisition is fair and reasonable, using anticipated quotes to be received, market research, and a comparison of the Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE) with that found reasonable for the same or similar services. As there are multiple authorized resellers of this Brand Name, we request fair and open competition between the resellers. As the software is manufactured by F5 the best value determination will be lowest cost technically acceptable.</p>
<p>8. MARKET RESEARCH: (FAR 6.303-2(a) (8)). Market research was conducted to determine the availability of commercial resellers, The F5 Networks, Inc. website provided a list of eleven (11) authorized reseller and "Global Unity Partners," each business is a large business. The list of large businesses included: Cable and Wireless, Datacraft Asia Ltd. Dell, EDS, Enterasys Ericsson, Hewlett Packard, IBM, Nokia Siemens Networks, Siemens, T-Systems.</p>
<p>On 28 June 2011, a sources sought notice was forwarded to F5 Networks, Inc. requesting a list of small business authorized-resellers, capable of meeting the government requirement.
