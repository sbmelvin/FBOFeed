BACKGROUND Boone Road is located approximately 26 miles east of Lucerne Valley in San Bernardino County.  Boone Road is approximately 3.8 miles long, beginning at State Highway 247 and ending in the vicinity of Means Lake in the Johnson Valley Off Highway Vehicle Area (T3N, R4E).  Boone Road is presently an unimproved dirt road.  The existing road surface is severely eroded in several areas due to storm water runoff from an estimated 9,000 to 10,000 acre tributary drainage area which originates approximately 6 miles south of Hwy 247 in the Bighorn Mountain Wilderness Area.  The drainage path crosses Boone Road in predominantly 3 locations, causing a vertical sight safety problem in one location and severe erosion at the two other locations. The road has also been eroded as a result of off highway vehicle use to a point that the existing road surface is 3 feet below existing adjacent grade in some locations. This condition exasperates the drainage erosion problem by trapping and conveying runoff along the existing road surface. Also, the off highway vehicle use of the road has caused the breaking down of an otherwise stable road bed to a fine particle material which creates an air quality issue.   2.	DESCRIPTION OF WORK AND SERVICES A.   Task 1 - Soil Investigation and Sampling by Auger Borings The soil borings shall be preformed under the direction of a professional geotechnical or soils engineer registered in the State of California. Perform soil borings at designated stationing and offsets.

<RESPDATE>101705
<ARCHDATE>11152005
<CONTACT>Phyllis Townsley, 405-954-7816
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for repair services for four Radio Control Equipment (RCE) Line Replacement Units (LRUs) (NSNs 5998-01-398-5373, 5998-01-398-5375, 5998-01-478-6481, and 5998-01-423-3458) with various estimated annual quantities.  Motorola, acquired by General Dynamics Decision Systems (GDDS), was the original manufacturer of these radio components.  The RCE is a critical subsystem in the National Airspace System air-ground communications infrastructure.  It provides remote access to air-ground radios used by FAA Air Traffic Control personnel to communicate with aircraft.  An indefinite delivery/requirements type contract for one year with options to renew for four additional 1-year periods is contemplated. GDDS is the only known responsible source of supply for repair services, since they have proprietary rights to the original design and technical data.  The FAA does not have the technical data needed to provide to any other vendor.   Any concern desiring to become a source for FAA repair requirements is requested to provide a complete documentation package to the contracting officer, identified in this market survey no later than October 19, 2005.  The documentation must clearly demonstrate that the concern has ownership or legal access to required original equipment manufacturer documentation, test bed facility, and copies of the test procedures, specifications and equipment listings applicable to the item as well as access to replacement parts necessary to affect the repairs.   Any information received as a result of this market survey will not be for use outside the Government but solely for the purpose of determining whether an additional source may be approved for the repair of the radio components.  Statements that data will be obtained or that specifications or drawings will be developed are not acceptable.  This market survey shall not be construed as a request for proposal or an obligation on the part of the FAA to acquire these services.  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses to this market survey.  Responders to this market survey may be asked to provide additional details/information based on their initial submittal.

<DESC>This is a combined solicitation/synopsis for commercial items prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.       This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.     The solicitation number is HSCEAM-06-R-00009, which is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).     This requirement is an UNRESTRICTED acquisition.   The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 611699.

The proposed range must meet the following standards to qualify for consideration:  
 
The range time must be available exclusively to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) during the hours indicated. The range must be closed to the public during the corresponding hours and the hours for use should be scheduled.  The range may be indoor or outdoor.  The range must possess a minimum of 10 firing points and must be able to accommodate a qualification course distance minimum of 1.5 yards and a maximum of 25 yards.  The range must possess moveable barricades for the 25- and 15-yard line courses of fire.  The barricades shall be constructed of a material that does not deflect or ricochet rounds that inadvertently strike it. (Example:  wood).  The range shall possess adequate exterior lighting in both public and work areas. The range shall possess drinking fountains located near the range facilities for DHS use. The range shall be equipped with an eye wash station.  The range shall be equipped with men and women's restroom facilities with running water located near the range facilities for DHS use.  The range shall provide sufficient trash receptacles for used targets, target backings, and empty ammunitions boxes.  The range shall provide adequate on-site parking to accommodate 15 vehicles.  The range shall be located within a 40 minute commute from I-280 exit 8a in West Orange NJ.  Commute will be assessed during peak traffic times associated with morning and evening “rush hours”. The range must possess an on-site classroom facility with chalkboard or marker board to accommodate 25 students.   The range must be able to accommodate the following calibers: 9mm, .40, 45,.357 and .223 caliber ammunition.  The range shall possess rifle and shotgun capabilities. The range rules must allow movement between firing points and shall not restrict movement-oriented firearms training by students (i.e. standing to kneeling transitions.).  The range rules shall allow shooters to draw and fire from the holster.  The range rules cannot disallow a student from moving in front of the firing points with an instructor present, (i.e., tactical move and shoot type drills where instructor/student ratio would be too restrictive).   Indoor ranges must possess air conditioning, heating, and an approved ventilation system that conforms to existing OSHA standards.    
 
	DHS personnel will use the range an average of 8 days per month and approximately 85,000 rounds are anticipated to be shot per quarter. The proposals set forth shall price a minimum of 96 days per year.  Pricing shall be submitted on a pending basis.  The contractor will be paid per the actual number of days used not to exceed total available per year.   DHS will have priority scheduling as long as it is done 30 days in advance.
The range must be closed or concealed from the public during the corresponding hours.  Under this contract, DHS requires exclusive use of the range from 0700 to 1630 hours, and some blocks in the evening for night/low shooting.  This does not include weekends or holidays, however, there are may occasionally be circumstances wherein a day of the weekend may be needed.  Should weather (i.e, rainout) or unforeseen circumstances prevent the use of the range, DHS will have priority in re-scheduling those missed days within the same month, if possible, or the following month if not possible.  
 
PROPOSED SITE INSPECTION

As part of the proposal evaluation process, DHS reserves the right to inspect all proposed sites to ensure compliance with all requirements set forth above.

The proposed contract will be for (1) base year and (4) four one-year options with services commencing on or about December 9, 2005.

FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (JAN 1999) applies to this acquisition.     Additional clauses applicable to this acquisition are listed later in this document.

(1)       Qualification Statement.     Offeror shall confirm in writing that they meet all requirements set forth     in this solicitation/synopsis.     However, DHS reserves the right to visit proposed site(s) to verify that the range(s) meets minimum qualifications.

(b)       Price Factors

CAR-L01  NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE SUPPLIERS (OCT 2003) (a) Past performance for this procurement will be evaluated using the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program.  RYG is authorized by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Acquisition) for use in the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain, and operate the Fleet. (b) The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quote represents the best value to the Government.  As such, the basis for award will include an evaluation of each supplier’s past performance history for the Federal Supply Class(s) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) of the supplies and services being purchased.  The price to be considered in determining best value will be the evaluated price after application of Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEAs). (c) The procedures described in the clause entitled "Additional Evaluation Factor for Consideration of Past Performance--Navy Red/Yellow/Green Program (APR 1999)" will be used to a!  ssist in determining the best value for the Government. CAR-M01  ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION OF PAST PERFORMANCE—NAVY RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (APR 1999) (a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program, authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain, and operate the Fleet. (b) The purpose of RYG is to assist contracting personnel during source selection to determine the best value for the Government.  The program uses accumulated supplier past performance data to classify each supplier’s performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) as either red (high risk), yellow (moderate risk), green (low risk), or neutral (no risk established).  (c) To assist in source selection, a monetary assessment in the form of a Technical Evaluation Adjustment (TEA) is added to each supplier’s quote having a red or yellow classification!   for the FSC involved.  The dollar amount of the red or yellow TEA assessment is based on the cost to the Government of effecting additional actions required to assure performance by a supplier with an unsatisfactory performance history for the FSC(s) involved.  No TEA is assessed for a supplier having either a green or a neutral FSC RYG classification.  For purposes of the RYG program, a neutral classification is assigned to suppliers who are first time quoters to the Government for the FSC(s) involved, suppliers otherwise having no past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved, and suppliers whose past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved are over three years old.  After consideration of any other pertinent, price-related factors (e.g., transportation charges, first article testing, discount terms), the adjusted price becomes the basis for determining award.  A supplier’s FSC RYG classification may change over time as new or rev!  ised performance data becomes available.  (d) RYG Classifications are  summarized as follows:  (1) Green is low risk.  No performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  No TEA will be assessed. (2) Yellow is moderate risk.  Additional performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier’s price to reflect the Government’s estimated additional costs. (3) Red is high risk.  Significant additional performance assurance requirements are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier’s price to reflect the Government’s estimated additional costs.  (4) Neutral is no risk established.  No TEA is assessed; nevertheless, additional performance assurance requirements may be considered necessary to assure quality and on-time delivery.  (e) RYG classifications for all applicable FSCs are established monthly for each supplier and provided to them.  Suppliers may address questions about the program or their FSC RYG classifications to the Naval Sea Logistics Center (NLSC) Portsmouth Detachment!  , Federal Building, Room 400, 80 Daniel Street, Portsmouth, NH  0380l-3884, telephone 603-431-9460, ext. 464.

Offerors may obtain information on CCR registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at www.ccr.gov.

RYG is authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for the acquisition of commodities used to build and maintain the Fleet--materials, parts and components of ships, planes and weapons systems. (B) The Government reserves the right to award to the contractor whose offer represents the best overall purchase value to the Government. As such, the basis for contract award will include an evaluation of !  proposed contractor's quality performance history. The price to be considered in determining the best value will be the evaluated price after Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEA) or related quality assurance actions, as applicable, are applied to the offered price. (C) The procedures described in the clause of this solicitation entitled "ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTORS--CONTRACTOR EVALUATION SYSTEM, RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (MAY 1992)" will be used by the Contracting Officer to assist in determining the best purchase value for the Government - price, past quality performance and other factors considered.

<DESC>The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), an agency of the U.S. Government, requires a contractor with proven international experience to provide all conference planning, recruitment, promotion, logistics and business advisory services for one international business and investment conference focused on the housing sector to be held in sub-Saharan Africa. An investment conference is defined by OPIC as a conference in which participants are interested in investing (i.e. establishing an on-ground business presence in the region) versus simply looking to export products for sale in the region.

It is anticipated that the conference will take place in the spring of 2006 (Mid-March to late-April) and will probably occur between a Tuesday and Thursday, depending upon availability.  This is one of the things the contractor will assist in determining.

(h) As a recognized authority in the field of acquisition and supportability integration, serves as a member of the NS/EP community on matters pertaining to strategies for integration of acquisition (with emphasis on computer-based systems) and supportability.

(i) Serves as Team Chief.  Functions as Acting Chief of the Division in the absence of the appointed Division Chief or Deputy Division Chief.  Provides guidance and support in the organization, administration, and management of the division.

Knowledge

This position requires significant work experience demonstrating an ability to plan, develop, manage, and technically direct both acquisition and supportability projects involving NS/EP telecommunications systems.

The contractor must possess a complete understanding of the DISA mission and working knowledge of the entire NCS, including the functions of the DISA Headquarters, DITCO and the functions of the Military Departments in acquiring, operating and maintaining operational support systems, automated switches and transmission.

Thorough knowledge of public government telecommunications systems and the various hardware and software capabilities used in support of communications networks.  Must have demonstrated capability in applying such knowledge to initiate development of projects that specify and acquire communications hardware and software systems.

In-depth knowledge and experience in telecommunications theory and techniques applicable to large-scale, computerized, command, control, and communication systems or systems of equivalent complexity.  Experience in work requiring a high degree of creativity involving both systems synthesis and cost effectiveness evaluation of large systems.  Demonstrated ability to prepare both clear and concise acquisition plans which reflect advanced command, control and communications technologies.  Comprehensive experience in the preparation of detailed criteria for specifying the critical technical features of complex subsystems and elements.  Must also have been involved at a responsible level in system engineering management during the life cycle of major systems to include operations and logistics support of a complex system program or project.

Contractor must possess technical versatility and demonstrated multi-discipline ability in performing varied high-level technical assignments related to two or more of the following areas:  computers, communications, logistics, information-handling technology, command facilities, survivability/endurability criteria; and leadership of multi-disciplined, multi-organizational project teams.

Supervisory Controls		   

The contractor functions within the framework of broad technical policy and planning.  Assignments are received in terms of general objectives.

The supervisor is kept informed of the status of controversial matters and major changes in approach.  Recommendations are accepted and technically sound.  Completed work is reviewed for conformance with overall policy and program objectives.  

Guidelines				 

Technical guidance primarily consists of the network design plans, DOD and Federal standards, procedures, and policy directives, specifications, and operational and security guidelines.  Due to the precedent setting nature of NS/EP, there are very few guidelines.  Where guidelines do not exist, the contractor is expected to use his own judgment in formulating a course of action, updating any existing guidelines and setting acquisition and supportability policy for DISA.

Complexity				

The work consists of broad functions and is characterized by intense efforts requiring several phases being pursued concurrently or sequentially by persons both within and outside of the agency.  The assignments involve areas where little or no established practices or precedents are available; therefore, the incumbent utilizes extensive analysis, initiative and resourcefulness to solve problems or devise new techniques or approaches.

Scope and Effect	

The purpose of the work is to plan, develop, manage and direct critical procurement programs that are necessary to NCS’ mission.  The assignments have the potential for affecting major research or social programs which can affect the quality of life for a long time.

Personal Contacts		

Personal contacts include high-ranking officials within DoD and the Federal Government.  Contacts may also include key persons from national and international organizations.  Other contacts include technical professionals employed by Government contractors and technical experts from industry.

Purpose of Contacts		 

Purpose of contacts is to justify, defend, negotiate or settle matters involving significant issues or problems.  The incumbent is responsible for justifying and defending the directorate’s position.

Physical Demands			

The work is generally sedentary.  Physical mobility is required for participation at site surveys, installations, seminars and meetings with Government agencies at local and distant locations.

Work Environment			

Work is performed in an office/telecommunications center setting.

The contractor must have, or be capable of, obtaining a TOP SECRET clearance.

This is a Testing Designated Position (TDP).

Minimum Qualifications:

A.	15 years of experience in federal acquisition/contracting, preferably telecommunications related with DOD level III certificate or equivalent.

B.	10 years of experience in government finance.

C.	 Bachelors degree with masters preferable in business or business related.

D.	Clearance of TS or equivalent.

Traffic Control and Management Systems Upgrade in Rio de Janeiro.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop technical assistance for Companhia de Engenharia de Trafego (CET-RIO), to upgrade its traffic control and management system. The technical assistance has two key objectives:  1) to help CET-RIO plan a new traffic control and management center in preparation for the Pan American Games; and 2) to develop an intelligent transportation systems (ITS) architecture plan to ensure that the existing and future deployment of intelligent transportation systems occur within a compatible framework.  

CET-RIO is the municipal agency responsible for traffic management, road network planning and projects, and traffic safety programs.  CET-RIO is seeking to upgrade and integrate its traffic signal control, closed circuit cameras, and passenger information systems into one platform. As part of its efforts to upgrade its network, CET-RIO’s priority project involves the installation of a traffic control and management center in the Barra de Tijuca area, where many activities associated with 2007 Pan American Games will be located, and which currently is not covered by the city’s existing network of computerized traffic signals.  The technical assistance will consider the option of planning a joint command center that would meet the security needs of the Pan American Games and both the immediate and future traffic control objectives of CET-RIO. 

In addition, CET-RIO’s traffic management modernization projects include upgrading its existing traffic signaling system with adaptive control systems; implement reversible lane control systems in three principal roadways; install variable message signs in 10 strategic locations; and expand traffic control and management in regions of the city where there is no centralized traffic control capacity. The technical assistance also includes planning an ITS architecture that will define applications, standards and specifications to facilitate the integration and interoperability of intelligent transportation systems in Rio de Janeiro.  

The specific tasks included in the terms of reference can be summarized as follows:
The specific tasks can be summarized as follows:

1.	Review of Existing Conditions, Goals and Objectives
2.	Technical Analysis and Identification of Needed ITS Functions, Improvements and Projects

BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT


PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY.  THE 305th CONTRACTING SQUADRON, pursuant to this BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA), SOLICITS CONCEPT PAPERS IN SUPPORT OF THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE AIR MOBILITY BATTLELAB.
A. INTRODUCTION:  The United States Air Force (USAF) Air Mobility Battlelab (AMB) is the Mobility Air Forces (MAF) catalyst for innovation across the spectrum of MAF missions and skills.  We capitalize on links with industry, laboratories, academia and MAF professionals, to advance the USAF distinctive capabilities of Rapid Global Mobility and Agile Combat Support.  Our primary focus is on identifying and investigating initiatives capable of being demonstrated in 18 months.  Through this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), AMB invites solution white papers with rough-order-of-magnitude cost and schedule estimates that address technological innovations and/or process improvements that reduce mobility response times, reduce deployable support structures, increase deployed combat capability and effectiveness, and/or enable USAF members to do their job more efficiently.  This BAA is issued under the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) paragraphs 35.016 and 6.102(d)(2) which provides for the competitive selection of technology demonstration proposals.  Contracts awarded based on responses to this BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of Public Law 98-369, "The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984."  Responses shall reference Solicitation Number.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS EFFECTIVE UNTIL 30 SEP 06, AND WHITE PAPERS MAY BE SUBMITTED AT ANY TIME UP TO THAT DATE.  AMB considers submissions by evaluation of a five page white paper.  A copy of this BAA is also posted on the World Wide Web at http://public.mcguire.amc.af.mil/AMWC/battlelab.htm. 
B. OBJECTIVE:  Technical Description.  AMB solicits innovative white papers addressing solutions to identified MAF needs.  AMB prefers to use contractor-loaned equipment or to participate in Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs), but does have limited funding for demonstrations.  Ultimately, the AMB conducts operational demonstrations of innovative mobility concepts, evaluates their military worth, and presents its assessments to senior decision makers including the Commander of the Air Mobility Warfare Center, the Commander of Air Mobility Command, Commander U.S. Transportation Command, and the Chief of Staff of the USAF. 

Within the fields of Rapid Global Mobility and Agile Combat Support, current high-interest areas include:
 
a.	 Aeromedical evacuation enhancements
b.	 Air base opening capabilities
c.	Aircraft threat mitigation
d.	Autonomous landing capabilities
e.	Enhancing aircrew situational awareness
f.	Collaborative tools to facilitate C2 reach back capabilities
g.	Expeditionary airbase/en route force protection
h.	MAF/CAF interoperability, specifically organizational and process interoperability
i.	NVG-compliant airfield lighting and NVG training
j.	Precision airdrop and airdrop tracking
k.	Real time in transit visibility 
l.	Seamless and secure communication between MAF/CAF aircraft, C2 centers, and ground forces
m.	Tactically-relevant aircrew training devices

AMB solicits white papers with the potential to enhance Air Force operations within any element of air mobility operations or their interfaces with the rest of the Defense Transportation System.  Submitters are encouraged to visit http://public.mcguire.amc.af.mil/AMWC/battlelab.htm to view a current list of AMB innovation areas.
C. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:  Submitters are required to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Number and reference the BAA number with their submissions.

<DESC>HMMWV RECAP PRIME SERVICES INTEGRATOR LOGISTICS SERVICES CONTRACT 

The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) has developed a logistics support concept known as HMMWV RECAP Prime Services Integrator.  The main goal of this effort is to provide improved logistics support to the military customer by applying commercial supply chain management techniques and practices to the military support infrastructure.  The HMMWV RECAP program is an Army program that receives M998 configuration HMMWVs from the field units, disassembles, replaces targeted parts and components, remanufactures others and rebuilds the vehicle to an M1097 configuration.  At that point, the vehicle is at zero miles, zero hours, platform ready for issue to tactical formations.   Through this contract and partnership with the contractor, DLA is to provide spare parts and logistical support services associated with the RECAP with the exception of engines and transmissions.  This program provides total supply chain management in support of services and consumables used in recapitalization of the HMMWV at Red River Army Depot (RRAD) and Letterkenny Army Depot (LEAD).  This logistics solution will integrate the various sources of supply, while still providing seamless interface with DLA and its customers. The contractor will employ a combination of commercial and government (DLA) sources of supply in performance of logistics support.       

The Statutory Authority permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition for this action is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) as cited in FAR 6.302-1.  It has been determined by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) that  AM General LLC, 105 Niles Avenue, South Bend, IN 46617, as the developer and sole manufacturer of the HMMWV, is the only firm with the technical expertise and in-place logistics system necessary to meet the requirements of this solicitation.

This acquisition is for a requirements type contract to include a services CLIN as well as part support for 1,098 NSNs (of which 1027 are DLA-managed NSNs)  in support of the Army HMMWV Recap Program at Red River Army Depot (RRAD) and Letterkenny Army Depot (LEAD) for January 2006 through FY08.  Of the population of NSNs covered under HMMWV RECAP, it is anticipated that the Contractor will provide 342 NSNs.   It is intended that DLA will be the first source of supply for 752 NSNs, meaning the Contractor will first contact DLA for these parts on a fill or kill/best value basis. 

The HMMWV RECAP contractor will function as the Prime Services Integrator (PSI) for three separately described but interwoven services required to effectively and efficiently RECAP HMMWVs: 1) Technical support to apply best manufacturing and repair practices to both Red River Army Depot (RRAD) and Letterkenny Army Depot (LEAD) production lines; 2) Repair parts, components and kit support from a combination of commercial and government (DLA and TACOM) sources of supply to accomplish the required repairs and upgrades; and 3) Operation of a system for replenishing (i.e. “pushing”) the required parts using proven just-in-time supply practices--in essence, a Prime Service Integrator.   These services will be in support of the Tank-automotive and Armaments Command’s HMMWV RECAP program and will be accomplished in accordance with a Statement of Work (SOW) jointly developed by TACOM, Defense Supply Center Columbus (DSCC) and finalized with AM General.  The measurable goal of acquiring these parts and services is to produce a better product to the field, faster and at a lower cost.  The actual dollar value of this acquisition will depend upon the actual services delivered and the condition of the vehicles being RECAP’ed by RRAD and LEAD.

In an effort to best meet these objectives and improve the current state of business, TACOM and DLA have proposed additional partnering with the awardee to provide Just in Time (JIT) support (100% supply availability) to the Army RECAP lines at RRAD and LEAD. The goals of this concept are:
•	Increased vendor management of supplies (i.e. 100% parts management for RRAD and LEAD)
•	Reduced Government costs (inventory/overhead), especially for the customer
•	Improved supply chain performance—zero response time (i.e. 100% supply availability)
•	Government/Industry partnering
 
By consistently satisfying customer demands on time, providing accurate forecasting and preventing repair delays due to stock outs on the production line, this improved supply chain performance will lead to increase in availability for the HMMWV weapons systems. 

This acquisition also includes services to provide support for the production line at RRAD and LEAD.  The services include the following:

•	Supply chain and inventory management
•	Parts acquisition
•	Distribution
•	Material forecasting
•	Obsolescence management
•	Dedicated program customer service representatives
•	Kitting

The NSN listing and detail related to the required services are included as an attachment to this notice. The following information is available at http://www.dscc.dla.mil/offices/land/hmmwv_recap.html Manufacturer’s Code and Part Number (if applicable), Drawing Number (if applicable), Specification Number (if applicable), Qualification Requirements (e.g. QPL) and where information on qualification requirements may be obtained. (if applicable).  Anticipated annual quantity and Unit of Issue information are included on the attached spreadsheet.  Destination Information:  Letterkenney Army Depot and Red River Army Depot; Delivery Schedule:  See Description.  FOB Destination.  

All responsible sources may submit an offer/quote which shall be considered.

The proposed procurement contains an option to extend the contract period one or more times at the discretion of the government.  The total duration (base plus option years) shall not exceed 3 years.  

 The contractor furnished items are a combination of competitive and sole source items, specifically identified in the attachment

Conditions for Evaluation and Acceptance of Offers for Part Numbered items applies.  

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

Note:  Access to the Web Portal outlined in C.10 of the Statement of Work will only be provided to the Awardee upon approval by the COR.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

POC:  Marcia Goldman, Contract Specialist (301) 496-2302 
DESC:  The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and technical and customer service capabilities of small businesses interested in providing dosimetry services to NIH. NIH possesses a Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) license authorizing its use of radioactive materials that includes requirements for performing routine monitoring for external occupational exposure, notification of individuals and their supervisors when exposures approach maximum permissible limits, and making recommendations for remedial action whenever appropriate.  Independently, and not as an agent of the Government (the Customer), the Contractor shall furnish the personnel, labor, facilities, equipment, parts, materials, and supplies necessary to provide a comprehensive external exposure monitoring program, including associated services, in accordance with the requirements of the NIH license.  Through the Division of Radiation Safety (DRS), the Office of Research Services (ORS) provides radiation exposure monitoring services to NIH employees who utilize radioactive materials and radiation producing equipment in the course of their research.  The ORS is seeking organizations that can provide state of the art dosimetry equipment, timely reading and reporting of the monitoring results, and a comprehensive, interactive database from which historical and regulatory data may be readily obtained.  The intended procurement will be classified under NAICS Code 541380 size standard  10.0 million.  The ORS intends to award a new contract to the dosimetry provider whose services most adequately support the programs and the needs of the NIH.  Services that will be required by this procurement will include, but are not limited to, the furnishing of all personnel, labor, facilities, equipment, parts, materials, and supplies considered essential for providing all specified types of personal and environmental dosimeters, including dosimeter calibration, monitoring, and necessary associated services in accordance with NIH requirements.  These requirements shall include maintaining a Certificate of Accreditation from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) through its National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) for all test categories applicable to whole-body, extremity, and environmental dosimeters.  Additional requirements include the ability to utilize existing NIH methodology for record keeping and identification of employees and lab groups, permitting direct computer access to personnel monitoring database(s) by DRS personnel, participation in a joint QA/QC program as directed by the DRS, and providing dosimetry equipment that is hermetically sealed such that it permits gas and/or liquid wash sterilization while guarding against damage from water and laboratory chemicals.  Additionally, qualified businesses should demonstrate a propensity for the development and incorporation of innovative and efficiency-improving systems, products, and customer service into their proposed dosimetry service.   An example would be the availability of operational or electronic dosimeter systems that allow for on-site management of personnel exposures.  Experience in managing similar dosimetry service contracts must be demonstrated. This market survey is being conducted through the CBD to reach the widest possible audience and to gather current market information. Responding firms should provide two (2) copies of their capability statement to the Office of Procurement Management at the address provided not later than February 7, 2005. Please send to the attention of Marcia Goldman, 6011 Executive Blvd., Room 539A, Bethesda, Maryland  20892-7663



Basic Services:
 
1.  Whole Body Dosimeters:  Whole body monitoring systems will preferably use optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) or an equivalent technology.  The ideal system involves the use of a single monitor capable of detecting beta, gamma, and neutron radiations.  The monitor must be designed for "clip-on" attachment to a worker's clothing for use under normal conditions, but should also be versatile enough to be adaptable to other monitoring situations such as extremity-wrist, lens of eye, or area monitoring if required.  The system should possess a minimum reporting precision of 1 mrem with complete re-analysis capability to allow for dose measurement confirmation, it should incorporate a filtering mechanism that allows for differentiation between the various types and energies of radiation encountered, and it must be capable of qualitatively detecting and quantitatively measuring dose equivalents from low- and high-energy beta; low-, medium- and high-energy photon radiations; and neutrons in the thermal, intermediate, and fast ranges.  Accreditation must be in NVLAP categories I through VI as defined in ANSI/HPS N13.11 - 2001, Personnel Dosimetry Performance - Criteria for Testing.

A.  Minimum Reportable Doses:
(1) gamma, x ray -  1 mrem
(2) energetic beta -  10 mrem
(3) neutron -	 10 mrem thermal;  20 mrem fast
B.	Minimum Detectable Energies:
(1) gamma, x ray -  5 keV

C.	Minimum Detection Ranges:
(1) low and high energy gamma, x ray -  1 mrem to 1000 rem
	(2)	beta -  10 mrem to 1,000 rem
(3)	neutron -  20 mrem to 25 rem
D.	Analysis and quantification above 1000 rem must be available upon request.
E.	Sterilization: Dosimeters should be hermetically sealed and if possible, capable of being sterilized by gases such as ethylene oxide, or by solutions such as Betadine, Cidex, Wescodyne, or other similar means without compromising the integrity or capability of the monitor. 

Whole Body Monitor Option:  The contractor may substitute or offer another currently available dosimetry technology as an alternative to the OSL system, providing that the performance characteristics and the information available from the dosimeter provide comparable quantitative and qualitative data such as: static vs. dynamic exposure, shielded exposure, (i.e. an image of the exposure is available).

2.  Extremity Dosimeter:  Ring dosimeters shall be available as extremity monitors.  OSL is preferred, however, monitoring may also be accomplished via thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) extremity finger monitors.  Monitors shall be designed either as an adjustable ring or supplied in a minimum of three sizes (small, medium, and large).  Rings shall be designed with a label that bears all necessary identifying information in such a manner that it is impervious to fading/smearing due to moisture/washing.  TLD dosimeters shall be manufactured of Harshaw TLD-100 LiF ribbon or equivalent that is near tissue equivalency, possessing high sensitivity, a low fade rate, and extreme durability.  Accreditation must be in NVLAP extremity categories I through IV as defined in ANSI/HPS N13.32 - 1995, Performance Testing of Extremity Dosimeters.


A.	Minimum Reportable Doses:
(1) gamma, x ray - 30 mrem
(2) energetic beta - 40 mrem
B.   Minimum energy sensitivity:
(1) gamma, x ray - 10 keV
(2) energetic beta - 200 keV
C.	Minimum Detection Ranges:
(1) low and high energy gamma, x ray - 30 mrem to 1,000 rem
(2) beta over 1 MeV - 50 mrem to 1,000 rem
D.	Analysis and quantification above 1000 rem must be available upon request. 
E.	Ultraviolet Sensitivity: possible exposure to UV radiation shall be minimized or eliminated by the use of UV absorbing materials.
F.	Sterilization: Rings must be capable of being sterilized by gases such as ethylene oxide, or by solutions such as Betadine, Cidex, Wescodyne, or other similar products without compromising the integrity or capability of the monitor. 

Extremity Ring OSL Option: The contractor may substitute or offer another currently available extremity ring monitor technology as an alternative to the OSL, providing that the performance characteristics and information available from the dosimeter meets or exceeds that provided by the ring monitor described above.

3.  Environmental Dosimeter:  Environmental TLDs are deployed on a quarterly basis and shall be capable of a minimal detectable exposure of approximately 1 mrem.  The dosimeter shall consist of a minimum of two (2) tissue equivalent TLD elements in a single holder, with packaging that is weatherproof and suitable for deployment, as is, in the normal environment (rain, snow, sun, etc.) without the need for additional weather protection or housings.  The devices shall be provided with an easily deployable mounting device or container which is tamper resistant and can be easily fastened to signs, trees, lamp posts, etc., through the use of wire ties, clips, or other non-permanent fasteners.  The color should be black or some other non-vibrant/dull color, and the label containing required identifying information must be resistant to smearing and/or fading as a result of exposure to extreme or continued inclement weather.  Accreditation must be in accordance with ANSI N545.

A.	Error Limits:  Measurement error should not exceed 100% at the 95% confidence level for exposures below 10 mrem/quarter; and 30% at the 95% confidence level for exposures above 10 mrem/quarter.
B.	Filtration:  Filtration shall be such that at least one element is provided with at least 250 mg/cm2 of filtration.  
C.	Fade:  The dosimeter's fade characteristics shall be such that the dosimeter will not fade in excess of ten percent (10%) per quarter.
D.	The dosimeter must be accurate, durable, and measure to 1 mrem ambient dose equivalent:

Type of	Energy of	Dose Range		
Radiation	Radiation	 ( rem )  	Error Limit (%) 
  		X-ray, gamma	     .05 - 2 MeV           .001 - 10	(see text above)

Environmental TLD Option:  The contractor may substitute or offer as an alternative another available Environmental Dosimeter technology, provided that the performance characteristics and information available from the dosimeter meets or exceeds that listed above.

4.	Quantity:  The following required quantities will change over the life of this contract, with stated estimates reflecting current program requirements. Continuing program and regulatory review will dictate necessary changes in specific requirements for contract option years.  It is not anticipated that the total number of persons monitored will vary by more than + 25% each year.

<DESC>NOTE:  THE ORIGINAL SYNOPSIS STATED "PRICING SHALL BE PERMITTED ON A PENDING BASIS" - IT IS CORRECTED VIA THIS MODIFICATION/AMENDMENT TO STATE
"PRICING SHALL BE PERMITTED ON A PER DAY BASIS".


This is a combined solicitation/synopsis for commercial items prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.       This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.     The solicitation number is HSCEAM-06-R-00009, which is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).     This requirement is an UNRESTRICTED acquisition.   The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 611699.

The proposed range must meet the following standards to qualify for consideration:  
 
The range time must be available exclusively to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) during the hours indicated. The range must be closed to the public during the corresponding hours and the hours for use should be scheduled.  The range may be indoor or outdoor.  The range must possess a minimum of 10 firing points and must be able to accommodate a qualification course distance minimum of 1.5 yards and a maximum of 25 yards.  The range must possess moveable barricades for the 25- and 15-yard line courses of fire.  The barricades shall be constructed of a material that does not deflect or ricochet rounds that inadvertently strike it. (Example:  wood).  The range shall possess adequate exterior lighting in both public and work areas. The range shall possess drinking fountains located near the range facilities for DHS use. The range shall be equipped with an eye wash station.  The range shall be equipped with men and women's restroom facilities with running water located near the range facilities for DHS use.  The range shall provide sufficient trash receptacles for used targets, target backings, and empty ammunitions boxes.  The range shall provide adequate on-site parking to accommodate 15 vehicles.  The range shall be located within a 40 minute commute from I-280 exit 8a in West Orange NJ.  Commute will be assessed during peak traffic times associated with morning and evening “rush hours”. The range must possess an on-site classroom facility with chalkboard or marker board to accommodate 25 students.   The range must be able to accommodate the following calibers: 9mm, .40, 45,.357 and .223 caliber ammunition.  The range shall possess rifle and shotgun capabilities. The range rules must allow movement between firing points and shall not restrict movement-oriented firearms training by students (i.e. standing to kneeling transitions.).  The range rules shall allow shooters to draw and fire from the holster.  The range rules cannot disallow a student from moving in front of the firing points with an instructor present, (i.e., tactical move and shoot type drills where instructor/student ratio would be too restrictive).   Indoor ranges must possess air conditioning, heating, and an approved ventilation system that conforms to existing OSHA standards.    
 
	DHS personnel will use the range an average of 8 days per month and approximately 85,000 rounds are anticipated to be shot per quarter. The proposals set forth shall price a minimum of 96 days per year.  Pricing shall be submitted on a PER DAY basis.  The contractor will be paid per the actual number of days used not to exceed total available per year.   DHS will have priority scheduling as long as it is done 30 days in advance.
The range must be closed or concealed from the public during the corresponding hours.  Under this contract, DHS requires exclusive use of the range from 0700 to 1630 hours, and some blocks in the evening for night/low shooting.  This does not include weekends or holidays, however, there are may occasionally be circumstances wherein a day of the weekend may be needed.  Should weather (i.e, rainout) or unforeseen circumstances prevent the use of the range, DHS will have priority in re-scheduling those missed days within the same month, if possible, or the following month if not possible.  
 
PROPOSED SITE INSPECTION

As part of the proposal evaluation process, DHS reserves the right to inspect all proposed sites to ensure compliance with all requirements set forth above.

The proposed contract will be for (1) base year and (4) four one-year options with services commencing on or about December 9, 2005.

<RESPDATE>110405

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide clarification for the topic "A Remote TB Control and Prevention System."  

Clarification needed and Questions:

One of the critiques of one of the contract proposals submitted under SBIR Contracts Topic 021 last year was that it did not provide a completely functional production system meeting all CDC requirements at the end of Phase 1.  It is their understanding that Phase 1 SBIR awards typically are feasibility efforts, followed by more substantial Phase 2 projects that reach the point of commercial viability.  Should the contractor consider the potential of Phase 2 work in their 2006 application?

Answer:

Phase 1 effort should culminate with a feasibility assessment and that this assessment should address implementation outcomes from a prototype application/demonstration which then could be used as 'proof of concept' for any Phase 2 application which would lead to a more developed product. Phase 1 has to show that this concept can be achieved by demonstrating a viable application which, understandably, will not contain all functionalities in a fully developed application.  It would be important for the contractor, once funded, to interact with CDC to develop a complete list of core functionalities which could be tested and evaluated during Phase 1.  The outcomes of this testing would result in the Phase 1 feasibility assessment report which should also address what next steps are necessary to move from a proof of concept to a viable application.  Some next steps might be, but are not limited to, system development, user support, training, deployment, data security, detailed report generation, local jurisdictional functionalities.

No other terms or conditions are changed by reason of this amendment.

<DESC>UPDATE - 7 Oct 05 – Draft RFP and Virtual Industry Day Procedures Draft RFP Upload The draft Request for Proposal (RFP) loaded to the XR-SIMAF library below is an  85% solution which has been loaded for insights needed for the Virtual Industry  Day being held at 1330 EST on 18 Oct 05. Contract writting system problems  prevented loading a complete RFP document.  A word version of the Draft RFP  FA8626-05-R-2077 has been loaded to the PIXs library below.  This word version  does not contain the section J attachments which have been loaded separately to  the library. Plans are to update the draft RFP on 14 October 2005 to flesh out  several aspects including: H0XX – OCI Mitigation Plan Acceptability Criteria; H081 – Provide goals for Small Business participation; Section I Reference Clauses – some fill-ins need filled in; Sec J – Exhibit A - add initial CDRL Data Item Description (DID) package; Sec J – Attachment 1 – update Draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) Sections  1 -4 and Sec 6 to eliminate redundancy and streamline the requirements; NOTE: PWS Section 5 describes the five functions, A through E,and is reasonably  complete,  however Sections 1 – 4 and Section 6 need updating to streamline and  add the Service Delivery Summary (SDS)etc.; Sec L075 – Update paragraphs 7.3.2; 7.3.3; 7.3.4; for instructions on the  Technical Expertise and Systems Engineering Mission Capability sub-factors;  add the tailored L-8 Labor Cost/Price spreadsheet;  Sec M – Function E evaluation criteria need added; remaining Sec M is good SIMAF Library Listing of planned contents will be added to PIXS library Virtual Industry Day (VID) The Virtual Industry Day (VID) Meet-Me phone number will be provided to  interested firms who register with the SIMAF POC Ms. Stiles at 937-904-7205,  Margaret.stiles@wpafb.af.mil . Written questions provided in advance of the VID  will have the most complete answers provided.  Verbal questions will be accepted during the VID but may be deferred if answers  are not immediately available. Firms will be identified during the VID only by  a letter identifying their company at time of registration, e.g. Company A,  Company B, etc., actual company names will not be used.  Questions on the draft RFP for Virtual Industry Day should be e-mailed to the  buyer, Theresa hay, at Theresa.hay@wpafb.af.mil with a copy to the Program  manager, Vince Lewis  at Vincent.lewis@wpafb.af.mil . Detailed questions on  format and minor issues are not the purpose of the VID. Questions that address  omissions and significant issues or areas of confusion are desired. XR-SIMAF Library The XR-SIMAF Library is not available until 19 Oct 05 between the hours of 0900  and 1500 EST. Library appointments must be made thru the SIMAF POC, Ms. Stiles  at 937-904-7205, Margaret.stiles@wpafb.af.mil  **************************************************************************** Update 4 October 2005 - Virtual Industry Day for draft RFP (imminent release)  and Buyer Name Update The XR-SIMAF draft RFP is planned for release by 11 October 2005.  A Virtual  Industry Day is planned to be held 1330 EST to 1530 EST, 18 October 2005.   Interested firms should review the draft RFP, once posted, and submit written  questions via e-mail to the new buyer, Theresa Hay, Theresa.Hay@wpafb.af.mil.   Submittal in advance will ensure that questions can be answered in a timely  manner during the Industry Day.  Firms need to contact the Virtual Industry  Day POC, Ms. Patricia Stiles, (937) 904-7205, Margaret.Stiles@wpafb.af.mil, to  register for the event.  Look for further information on this site for further  information regarding this Virtual Industry Day. Note:  New buyer Theresa Hay replaces Michelle Hendricks on all future  correspondence. ************************************************************************ Update 30 Sep 2005 - Re-Send to Fed Biz Opps - Organizational Conflict of  Interest The Fed Business Opportunities site can not handle the Description in excess  of 24000 characters so the original Sources Sought announcement of 17 May has  been saved as a WORD file and loaded to the XR-SIMAF PIXS library below  as "ORIGINAL_SOURCES_SOUGHT_ANNOUNCEMENT_17MAY05".   NOTE: The CO Finding letter to industry dated 29 Sept 2005 and the re-drafted  OCI clause for XR-SIMAF are loaded to the library below. ************************************************************************ Update 29 Sep 2005 - Organizational Conflict of Interest The Contracting Officer has found that the potential for OCI is a significant  concern for successful performance of the XR-SIMAF Capabilities Integration  Services contract(s) and therefore the OCI clause has been re-drafted to  reflect this concern. OCI Mitigation Plan Acceptability Criteria will address  the OCI issue in the draft Request for Proposal (dRFP) and any resulting  contract(s). Further, in source selection the potential for OCI will be  considered in the determination of which proposal offers the best value to  the Government.   The CO Finding letter to industry dated 29 Sept 2005 and the re-drafted OCI  clause for XR-SIMAF are loaded to the library below. *********************************************************************** Update 16 Sep 2005 - Small Business Size Standard Update The upcoming competition for the XR-SIMAF services acquisition will require  offerors to submit robust small business subcontracting goals for services  that involve a high level of complex skill sets.  The NAICS code of 541710  remains the same  however the size standard for small businesses in this  acquisition (briefed on 14 June 2005 at Industry Days) has been raised to  1,000 employees. The original FBO/PIXS announcement indicated $10,000,000  however the Industry day briefing indicated a size standard of 500 employees.  The Contracting Officer has determined that a size standard of 500 could  overly restrict Large Businesses who must assemble a robust subcontracting  plan by limiting the pool of qualified small businesses that could provide  support for this acquisition and artificially reduce subcontracting goals.   Thus, in an effort to broaden the desired small business base for this  acquisition and facilitate stronger small business participation, the size  standard for small businesses in this acquisition has been raised to 1,000  employees.  This determination has been coordinated and approved by the ASC  Small Business and the Small Business Administration offices. ********************************************************************** Update 18 Aug 2005 – Initial Acquisition Strategy + Delay in dRFP Release Assessment of the submitted Statements of Capability (SOC) was completed on 8  July 2005. The XR-SIMAF overall acquisition strategy was presented at the  Acquisition Strategy Panel on 22 Jul 2005 and approved. It was determined that  this XR-SIMAF acquisition will not be a Small Business (SB)Set-Aside.  The SB  strategy under consideration will require offers to provide aggressive small  business subcontracting participation in any proposal. Pending final approval of the detailed strategy in the Acquisition Plan, we  will consider up to two awards for consolidated Function Areas A, B, C and E  under a prime contractor(s) (based on a Best Value Source Selection decision).  Area D may be made as a stand alone award or combined with an A-B-C-E award.   Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) is still a significant issue that  will be addressed in a tailored clause AFMC 5352.209-9002, which should be  posted to PIXS in the next two weeks.   The anticipated release of the dRFP is sliding by 45 days to late Sept 2005.  Industry will have 30 days to comment on the draft RFP. Release of the formal  RFP may slide by 45 days until late November 05 with proposals due early Jan  06. Award is contemplated late April 06.  A new attachment (Schedule_18_Aug_05.ppt) has been added showing the projected  schedule for this effort. ********************************************************************** Update 8 July 2005:  Third set of Industry Day questions and answers has been  added to the  library (scroll below).  Questions were received during one on one interview  sessions June 15, 2005.  ********************************************************************* Update:  Second set of answers to questions and Industry Day POCs - 24 June  2005 Questions were received prior to Industry Day regarding CMMI and current  contractors working in SIMAF.  A request was also received for contact  information of companies participating in Industry Days.  Both have been added  to the library (scroll below). We are working on questions received during Industry Day and anticipate  posting  answers by 6 July 2005. *************************************************************   Update: Upload of Industry Day Files - 15 Jun 05 Files briefed at the 14 Jun 05 Industry Day have been uploaded to the PIXS  library.  ********************************************************* Update: Extension of SOC Submittal Date + Industry Day briefings - 14 Jun 05 During the Industry Day held today, it was determined that the submittal of  the Statement of Capability (SOC), originally due on Friday June 17th will be  extended to 1600 (EST) Wed June 22nd. Several Questions were asked about the  SOC and the SOC format. For clarity the following infromation is provided: Format and Structure for a SOC Covering Multiple Functions QUESTION:  Because the standard business practices, company past performance and  responses to the OCI, ACA and ITAR requirements/restrictions will be the same  for all functional areas, would it be acceptable for the offeror to submit a  cover letter with separate attachments; one containing the common company data  and then attachments that address each functional area separately?  ANSWER: Yes, if a firm is providing a SOC for multiple functions the functions  being proposed may be grouped together under one cover page and submitted as a  package. Common or repeated information may be referred to from another  function area SOC, however stand-alone SOCs are preferred. One or two cross- references will be acceptable, however.  Cover Page - Firms are allowed to submit a one page cover page that may  contain business information and details like business size and CAGE code,  etc. The cover page does not count towards the 5 pages per function.  Submittal of SOC via e-mail QUESTION: Will it be acceptable to submit the SOC via email?  ANSWER: Yes, e-mail submittal is acceptable. Please  allow up to an hour for e- mail delivery incase of low band-width at WPAFB. Submit all electronic SOC  submittals  to Patricia Krabacher, patricia.krabacher@wpafb.af.mil. The PCO  will confirm receipt of the SOC. Availability of Industry Day Briefings QUESTION: Will the 14 June 05 XR-SIMAF Industry Day briefings be made available to  industry via PIXS, or via a CD and when? ANSWER: The 14 June Industry Day briefings will be loaded to PIXS and will  available for download by COB 15 Jun 05. ****************************************************************************** Update:  Posting of Improved Labor-Hour Estimate -- 7 June 2005 The following sentences have been modified in the following synopsis to  reflect an improved estimate of labor hours for this effort: FROM...

NIH possesses a Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) license authorizing its use of radioactive materials that includes requirements for performing routine monitoring for external occupational exposure, notification of individuals and their supervisors when exposures approach maximum permissible limits, and making recommendations for remedial action whenever appropriate.  Independently, and not as an agent of the Government (the Customer), the Contractor shall furnish the personnel, labor, facilities, equipment, parts, materials, and supplies necessary to provide a comprehensive external exposure monitoring program, including associated services, in accordance with the requirements of the NIH license.  Through the Division of Radiation Safety (DRS), the Office of Research Services (ORS) provides radiation exposure monitoring services to NIH employees who utilize radioactive materials and radiation producing equipment in the course of their research.  The ORS is seeking organizations that can provide state of the art dosimetry equipment, timely reading and reporting of the monitoring results, and a comprehensive, interactive database from which historical and regulatory data may be readily obtained.  The intended procurement will be classified under NAICS Code 541380 size standard  6.0 million.  The ORS intends to award a new contract to the dosimetry provider whose services most adequately support the programs and the needs of the NIH.  Services that will be required by this procurement will include, but are not limited to, the furnishing of all personnel, labor, facilities, equipment, parts, materials, and supplies considered essential for providing all specified types of personal and environmental dosimeters, including dosimeter calibration, monitoring, and necessary associated services in accordance with NIH requirements.  These requirements shall include maintaining a Certificate of Accreditation from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) through its National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) for all test categories applicable to whole-body, extremity, and environmental dosimeters.  Additional requirements include the ability to utilize existing NIH methodology for record keeping and identification of employees and lab groups, permitting direct computer access to personnel monitoring database(s) by DRS personnel, participation in a joint QA/QC program as directed by the DRS, and providing dosimetry equipment that is hermetically sealed such that it permits gas and/or liquid wash sterilization while guarding against damage from water and laboratory chemicals.  Additionally, qualified businesses should demonstrate a propensity for the development and incorporation of innovative and efficiency-improving systems, products, and customer service into their proposed dosimetry service.   An example would be the availability of operational or electronic dosimeter systems that allow for on-site management of personnel exposures.  Experience in managing similar dosimetry service contracts must be demonstrated. This market survey is being conducted through the CBD to reach the widest possible audience and to gather current market information. Responding firms should provide two (2) copies of their capability statement to the Office of Procurement Management at the address provided not later than February 7, 2005. Please send to the attention of Marcia Goldman, 6011 Executive Blvd., Room 539A, Bethesda, Maryland  20892-7663



Basic Services:
 
1.  Whole Body Dosimeters:  Whole body monitoring systems will preferably use optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) or an equivalent technology.  The ideal system involves the use of a single monitor capable of detecting beta, gamma, and neutron radiations.  The monitor must be designed for "clip-on" attachment to a worker's clothing for use under normal conditions, but should also be versatile enough to be adaptable to other monitoring situations such as extremity-wrist, lens of eye, or area monitoring if required.  The system should possess a minimum reporting precision of 1 mrem with complete re-analysis capability to allow for dose measurement confirmation, it should incorporate a filtering mechanism that allows for differentiation between the various types and energies of radiation encountered, and it must be capable of qualitatively detecting and quantitatively measuring dose equivalents from low- and high-energy beta; low-, medium- and high-energy photon radiations; and neutrons in the thermal, intermediate, and fast ranges.  Accreditation must be in NVLAP categories I through VI as defined in ANSI/HPS N13.11 - 2001, Personnel Dosimetry Performance - Criteria for Testing.

A.  Minimum Reportable Doses:
(1) gamma, x ray -  1 mrem

(2) energetic beta - 200 keV
C.	Minimum Detection Ranges:
(1) low and high energy gamma, x ray - 30 mrem to 1,000 rem
(2) beta over 1 MeV - 50 mrem to 1,000 rem
D.	Analysis and quantification above 1000 rem must be available upon request. 
E.	Ultraviolet Sensitivity: possible exposure to UV radiation shall be minimized or eliminated by the use of UV absorbing materials.
F.	Sterilization: Rings must be capable of being sterilized by gases such as ethylene oxide, or by solutions such as Betadine, Cidex, Wescodyne, or other similar products without compromising the integrity or capability of the monitor. 

Extremity Ring OSL Option: The contractor may substitute or offer another currently available extremity ring monitor technology as an alternative to the OSL, providing that the performance characteristics and information available from the dosimeter meets or exceeds that provided by the ring monitor described above.

3.  Environmental Dosimeter:  Environmental TLDs are deployed on a quarterly basis and shall be capable of a minimal detectable exposure of approximately 1 mrem.  The dosimeter shall consist of a minimum of two (2) tissue equivalent TLD elements in a single holder, with packaging that is weatherproof and suitable for deployment, as is, in the normal environment (rain, snow, sun, etc.) without the need for additional weather protection or housings.  The devices shall be provided with an easily deployable mounting device or container which is tamper resistant and can be easily fastened to signs, trees, lamp posts, etc., through the use of wire ties, clips, or other non-permanent fasteners.  The color should be black or some other non-vibrant/dull color, and the label containing required identifying information must be resistant to smearing and/or fading as a result of exposure to extreme or continued inclement weather.  Accreditation must be in accordance with ANSI N545.

A.	Error Limits:  Measurement error should not exceed 100% at the 95% confidence level for exposures below 10 mrem/quarter; and 30% at the 95% confidence level for exposures above 10 mrem/quarter.
B.	Filtration:  Filtration shall be such that at least one element is provided with at least 250 mg/cm2 of filtration.  
C.	Fade:  The dosimeter's fade characteristics shall be such that the dosimeter will not fade in excess of ten percent (10%) per quarter.
D.	The dosimeter must be accurate, durable, and measure to 1 mrem ambient dose equivalent:

Type of	Energy of	Dose Range		
Radiation	Radiation	 ( rem )  	Error Limit (%) 
  		X-ray, gamma	     .05 - 2 MeV           .001 - 10	(see text above)

Environmental TLD Option:  The contractor may substitute or offer as an alternative another available Environmental Dosimeter technology, provided that the performance characteristics and information available from the dosimeter meets or exceeds that listed above.

4.	Quantity:  The following required quantities will change over the life of this contract, with stated estimates reflecting current program requirements.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY TO PRE-QUALIFY VENDORS.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME AND THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  The United States Secretary of the Senate (hereinafter referred to as “the Secretary”) is seeking a qualified source to conduct a study of employment compensation, hiring, and benefits practices.  The study shall focus on organizational planning, pay band studies, market pay studies, compensation surveys, salary surveys, salary comparison studies and job analysis to summarize job descriptions which communicate job requirements, support wage and salary administration, and are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.  The budget for this project shall not exceed $80,000.  The Secretary invites all qualified sources to respond to this sources sought notice.  In order to be considered for the pre-qualification process, all interested parties must submit information that addresses each item listed above and in the Requirements and Instructions sections of this document.  Requirements: The vendor response to this sources sought notice shall specifically address the two evaluation criteria below.  The evaluation criteria for selection, listed in descending order of importance, are as follows: (1) Firm experience and past performance: The primary firm and sub-contractors must have specific experience, within the last five years, involving the study of employment compensation, hiring, and benefits practices.  The vendor shall list five projects, within the last five years, provide a detailed project description, and any other supplemental information necessary to demonstrate their specific experience, involving the study of employment compensation, hiring, and benefits practices. Firms are encouraged to provide any available documentation that would indicate their ability to complete projects on time and within budget, their ability to respond to changing workload requirements and schedules, and the overall satisfaction of past customers with their work.  Responses must include complete and current contact information of the past customers; the Senate will check references as necessary to evaluate past performance.  Experience and past performance will be evaluated on the basis of its breadth and depth, its similarity to the Senate project as well as the satisfaction of clients and overall quality of services represented by the projects described; and (2) Assignment of Personnel: The vendor must identify principals and individuals that would be assigned to work on the projects under the contract.  Designated employees must have specific experience, within the last five years, with projects involving the study of employment compensation, hiring, and benefits practices.  Personnel will be evaluated on the basis of the similarity of their experience to that expected to be required on work to be performed for the Secretary and on the overall quality of their work as represented by the projects described.  Failure to provide information on Requirements  1 and 2 above may result in disqualification of the vendor from consideration.  An evaluation team will review all vendor responses to select the most qualified vendors.  At the completion of the evaluation the Secretary reserves the right to issue a solicitation for the study of employment compensation, hiring, and benefits practices only to the most qualified vendors.  Responses must contain Firm Information: (Company Name, Address, Point of Contact, Telephone Number, Email address, DUNS Number and Tax ID Number).  INSTRUCTIONS: Responses to this sources sought request are due to the POC no later than October 24, 2005 at 12:00 Noon EDT and shall be submitted electronically via email only to the attention of Kathleen M. Haddow at acquisitions@saa.senate.gov.   The subject line of the email message shall be 2006-S-001 Compensation Study.  No other method of transmittal will be accepted.  The response shall not exceed fifteen (15) pages.  Pages over the page limitation will be discarded.  Senate access to information in any files attached to the response is the responsibility of the submitting party and neither the Senate nor the Secretary is responsible for any failure to access vendor’s information.  The information supplied in response to this sources sought notice will be used to pre-qualify firms that may be invited to submit proposals.  Firms responding to this sources sought notice and deemed qualified by the Senate will be placed on a solicitation mailing list.  Only pre-qualified firms will be permitted to submit proposals.  If suitable responses are received from qualified sources, the Secretary anticipates release of a solicitation in November 2005.  Neither the Senate nor the Secretary will be responsible for any costs for the preparation of responses to this request.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.

<SUBJECT>99--Intent to Establish a Qualified Manufacturer's List for Measurement Services
<DESC>Intent to Establish a Qualified Manufacturers List for High Pressure, High Flowrate Flow Measurement Services

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the National Metrology Institute of the United States, intends to establish U.S. National Measurement Standards for high-pressure, high gas flow rate measurements, disseminate these to U.S. industry, and, in concert with Na-tional Metrology Institutes (NMIs) of other nations, establish levels of equivalence of national measurement standards of the participating NMIs.  Of particular interest is the capability to establish such standards and calibration service in natural gas used in commerce. 

To establish these U.S. national gas flow rate measurement standards, NIST seeks to identify private sector entities that have flow measurement calibration and research facilities, in natural gas and other gases, and expertise to establish the U.S. National Measurement Standards.  

Qualified suppliers must be able to provide NIST with access and use of facilities with the capabilities listed below. Such access is required in a timely manner, and will utilize the operat-ing and technical expertise of the supplier’s personnel to safely and effectively operate the facilities for the purpose of establishing flowrate measurement standards and the calibration of flow meters in a range of sizes.  

The supplier’s facilities must be in the continental United States of America.

Given the rather demanding requirements of the services desired, qualified providers may have capabilities that do not meet all of the maximum values or dimensions as stated below, but do have capabilities that cover a significant portion of a parameter range. To better classify accept-able capabilities, acceptable ranges of variation are designated by tiers. 

First tier suppliers must have capabilities at or above the maximum values given for the various operating capabilities described below.  

Second tier suppliers may have restricted ranges of some parameters as described below.

TESTING FACILITIES CAPABILITIES
1. Provision of gas flows at operating conditions of:
a. Operating Pressure – Both tiers; Testing over the commonly encountered ranges of oper-ating pressures found in pipeline transportation of natural gas in the U.S. is desired.
	Maximum –  6.7 megapascals (67 atmospheres; 1,000 pounds per square inch (psi)) or above;
	Minimum – 4 megapascals (40 atmospheres; 600 psi);

b. Operating Temperature Range – Both tiers
	Normal ambient temperatures or a range of 4 degrees C to 50 degrees C (39.2 de-grees F to 122 degrees F) at time of operations.


2. Meter Test Section Dimensional Requirements:   Sufficient to install the meter to be tested and a minimum length of upstream piping, of the same nominal diameter as the meter, equivalent to 40 diameters of the metering element or greater. Upstream piping is to be straight and unobstructed.  The facility is to provide such piping. Upstream piping should be capable of supporting installation of flow conditioning devices of various lengths and types.
a. Pipe Diameters
	First tier -  25 mm to 762 mm (2 inches to 30 inches);
	Second tier – 25 mm to 300 mm (2 inches to 12 inches);
b. Length – Both tiers
	A minimum of 40 diameters of the internal diameter of the meter to be tested is required to be upstream of the meter. Flow conditioning capabilities at the entrance of the upstream piping are desirable and may be required in cases where the excessive swirl conditions may be induced in the flowing stream by piping configuration immediately upstream of the 40 diameter, or greater, piping upstream of the installed meter.

3. Gas density determination. This may be based on composition measurement capability supporting computation. Direct measurement of the density of the flowing gas at operating conditions is acceptable if the measurement uncertainty of the gas density can be documented to be below 0.01%.
a. Natural gas
      Capability for determination of gas composition using gas chromatographic analysis of up to six carbon atoms per molecule is required in addition to nitrogen and carbon dioxide concentration determination. Composition of natural gas varies as that normally found in commerce in the United States.

4.  Flow rate established over the pressure temperature ranges stated above.
a. First Tier – 500 to 20,000 cubic feet per minute
b. Second Tier – 500 to 2,000 cubic feet per minute

5. Flow rate control capability – Both Tiers
         Ability to establish control of the rate of flow through the meter test section such that the variation in flow rate does not exceed 5% of the nominal rate for test periods of 15 minutes. 

6. Expertise in operations of flow meter calibration facilities – Both Tiers
a. Demonstration of such expertise includes:
	The provision of flow meter calibrations to external or internal customers on a regular basis, e.g., a minimum of 10 meters per year constitutes a threshold.
	Publication in the flow metrology technical literature, particularly in the area of measurement uncertainty analysis of the systems and facilities considered here.

7.  Measurement uncertainty analysis and quality system documentation – both tiers
a.  Demonstrated by at establishment and use of a quality system.
	Facilities will demonstrate experience in quality system documentation conform-ing to the ISO 17025 or similar standard.
b. Accreditation by a recognized U.S. quality system accreditation body, e.g., the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program or the American Association of Laboratory Accreditation, constitutes acceptable levels of demonstration.

8. Measurement uncertainty documentation for the flow measurement standards and facilities – both tiers:
	Facility staff will work collaboratively with NIST staff to augment, where neces-sary, both measurement uncertainty analysis of the flow standards to be establish such that this documentation meets NIST’s requirements for provision of its measurement services. Such requirements are available upon request or may be found at www.nist.gov

9.  Direct access to high-speed Internet connections facilitating remote data acquisition and control of measuring instruments that NIST may place at the facility – Both Tiers.

10.  Demonstrated capability to safely install flow meters of various types up to the largest diameter capability of the facility – Both Tiers.

11.  Test sections that are protected to some degree from temperature excursions caused by the weather – Both Tiers.

12.  Capability to house and protect U.S. government-supplied equipment necessary for success-ful operations – Both Tiers.
a.  Buildings near to, or housing, the test sections which are suitable for the locating and sheltering the installation of NIST-supplied instrumentation and test equipment necessary to the meter calibration operations. 
b. Physical security for NIST-owned equipment is required to ensure that it is not damaged or its operation impaired during facility operations not associated with NIST-related ac-tivities or when the facilities are not operational.
c. Environmental requirements
	Temperature – 65 degrees F to 75 degrees F.
	Relative Humidity – 30 percent to 80 percent.

13. Multiple geographic sites – Both Tiers.
a.  Multiple sites are acceptable, but will require additional resources over a single site. In-stallation at multiple sites will be a point for additional negotiation.

INSPECTION OF FACILITIES
NIST reserves the right to periodically examine the facilities and technical capabilities of quali-fied manufacturers to determine if they meet the minimum requirements

NECESSARY IMPROVEMENTS OF MEASUREMENT CAPABILITIES

<CONTACT>Christopher D. Pigott  7037871238     Christopher.Pigott@mms.gov;
<DESC>The Department of Interior (DOI), GovWorks, intends to solicit full and open competition in accordance with FAR 6.102-(b).  This competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the U. S. Department of Interior Franchise Fund on behalf of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  HHS needs to contract for the requirement described below. I. Background. The mission of the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) is to prevent and eliminate unlawful discrimination in the provision of health care and social services generally and in HHS-funded programs particularly; to ensure the privacy of protected health information, and to enhance access to quality programs funded by the HHS.  Through public education, outreach, complaint investigation and resolution and other compliance activities, OCR helps HHS carry out its overall mission of improving the health and well-being of all people affected by its many programs.  Among other duties, OCR investigates complaints that alleged violations of various civil rights laws by HHS-funded recipients.  Among the laws enforced by OCR is Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by the recipients of federal financial assistance.  OCR enforces Section 504 with respect to HHS fund recipients.  OCR also enforces Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by states and local government entities, with respect to health and human services programs.  II. Objective.  This contract will help HHS, through OCR, implement the President's "New Freedom Initiative" and, more specifically, Executive Order 13217 (June 18, 2001), which directs the Secretary of HHS to provide technical guidance to help states achieve the goals of the ADA.  This contract will aid HHS in resolving key aspects of ongoing complaint investigations that alleged violations of Title II of the ADA and its implementing regulations and the Supreme Court's decision in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581(1999).  These complaints allege that qualified individuals with disabilities have been denied services in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs.  III. Scope.  OCR requires expert consultant services to evaluate actions undertaken by a state to assess and place on wait lists for community placement, individuals, currently institutionalized in state owned and operated psychiatric facilities, intermediate care facilities for individuals with mental retardation, and nursing facilities but who could receive community-based services as an appropriate alternative to institutional care.  The contractor will develop standards and criteria for evaluating the state's actions.  The contractor will advise OCR of the effectiveness of the state's wait list management and prioritization policies.  The contractor will also advise OCR as to the need for new or revised state policies, procedures and related documents, once institutionalized individuals are identified for community placement; review these documents, and make recommendations about them. In order to compete for this contract, interested parties should request a copy of the Request for Proposal including a Statement of Work by sending an email to the POC listed below.  Answers for questions submitted by offerors will only be transmitted to companies who submit requests.  Please ensure the GovWorks solicitation number 44724 is referenced in all correspondence. Point of Contact (POC) for this acquisition is Melicent Nhan at melicent.nhan@mms.gov or fax 703-787-1106.  Phone inquiries will not be entertained.

<DESC>The purposes of this amendment are as follows:

1.  Provide responses (in bold) to the following question from potential offerors:

A.  Can we assume that the Government will provide the necessary software for Oracle?  If so, what version of Orace should be assumed? The Contractor shall supply the necessary Oracle software which is version 11.5.9.

B.  Has the  implementation of these Oracle applications already occurred? If so, are the  students end users who need to learn how to use the applications? If not, are the students taking this class to learn how to implement the applications on their own?  The implementation of these Oracle applications has not yet occurred; those taking the class are doing so to learn how to implement applications on their own.

C,.  Do the courses  have to be taught by an Oracle certified trainer with Oracle certified  courseware?  The Government requires Oracle certified instructors and certified Oracle courseware.  Certificates are required.

D.  Are the people to be taught end users and only need to know how to use the application or are they people who will install and implement the applications?  The class participants will  include both end-users and system administrators.

E.  What are the dates for each of the classes to be taught?  There are a number of question marks in the bid.  The Government Point of Entry (fedbizopps.gov) does not accept special characters, such as a hyphen.  Therefore, when you see a question mark it should be noted that it is replacing a hyphen.
