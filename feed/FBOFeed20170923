<DESC>NOTICE:  THIS ACTION IS SET ASIDE FOR BOTH HISTORICALLY UNDERUTILIZED BUSINESS ZONE (HUBZONE) AND SERVICE DISABLED VETERAN OWNED SMALL BUSINESSES (SDVOSB) CONCERNS

This pre-solicitation notice is being issued as a set aside for both Historically Underutilized Business zone (HUBZone) and Service Disabled, Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) Concerns for competition nationwide. On or about May 22, 2014, Naval Facilities Engineering Command Midwest intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) under solicitation number N40083-14-R-3213 for an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Design Build Multiple Award Construction Contract (IDIQ D/B MACC) for roofing requirements at Naval Station Great Lakes, IL and Department of Defense facilities within a 450-mile radius of Naval Station Great Lakes.
 This solicitation shall be a one-step design/build multiple award construction requirement for the seed project and award of a maximum of five (5) Multiple Award Construction Contracts (MACCs).  Offerors who do not receive award of the seed project but which do receive award of the MACC will be awarded task orders in the amount of the minimum guarantee amount of $5,000.

It is the intent and objective of the Government to use this solicitation to award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) Design/Build Multiple Award Construction Contracts (DB MACC) for projects requiring design, demolition and installation for the provision of complete roofing systems and maintenance/repair of roofing systems including, if required, installation/repair of associated systems (roof drains, insulation and deck repairs, etc.) with some design capability for Navy, Marine corps or other Federal facilities in the Great Lakes IL vicinity, to include projects within four hundred and fifty (450) miles of Naval Station Great Lakes, IL.
 The contract vehicle shall be for a base period of nine months, with four (4) option periods of one year each. The length of the contract vehicle shall not exceed four years and nine months (57 months).

The NAICS Code for this proposed procurement is 238160 and the annual size standard is $14 million. The price range for the contract vehicle as a whole is not to exceed $3 million per year; the base and four (4) options total awarded dollar value shall not exceed $15 million or fifty-seven months, whichever comes first. 

This pre-solicitation notice is for the Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Seed Project, Repair/Replace roof systems at building 2B and building 1912 located at Naval Station, Great Lakes IL
.
 
In accordance with FAR 36.294, the estimated price range for the seed project is between $500,000 and $1,000,000. The period of performance for the seed project will not exceed 120 calendar days from the date of award. 

The successful proposer will be required to validate the design against the RFP requirements and accept design responsibility (i.e. sign and seal design drawings and specifications by registered professional engineers and architects).

The minimum guarantee of $5,000.00 is associated with this contract vehicle, which shall be de-obligated when a proposer has met or exceeded this amount in cumulative task order awards in the base period.  The minimum guarantee in the base period meets the minimum guarantee for the entire contract life and shall apply only to the base period; option periods shall have no minimum guarantee.

The Government reserves the right to add vendors within the same set-aside via on-ramp procedures at any time during the life of the contract.
 

When issued, the solicitation will be available in electronic media only and can be downloaded via the internet World-Wide Web at http://www.neco.navy.mil under solicitation N40083-14-R-3213.

<DESC>The Army Corps of Engineers Information Technology (ACE-IT) program, in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), intends to make a sole source award to a firm with the capability to provide New Enterprise Postal Systems and Services (Purchase/Lease/Maintenance) associated with United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) mailrooms. USACE has 9 Division and 45 Districts (to include field area offices), that are large users of Pitney Bowes postal meter and mailing equipment. USACE uses more than 180 Pitney Bowes digital mailing systems for mail sorting and processing of up to 65 pieces of mail per minute with the ability to track, calculate, print, and report postage expenses. USACE requires a new contract to purchase and lease Pitney Bowes Enterprise Postal System and Services to replace mail metering machines reaching end of life. This procurement will provide firmware/software upgrades, technical support via website and over the telephone, and hardware replacement for defective devices on a per-device basis.
<p>This action will have a twelve (12) month base period with four (4) twelve (12) month options, which will fulfill the requirement for the above detailed New Enterprise Postal Systems and Services.</p>
<p>The anticipated source is Pitney Bowes Inc., 3001 Summer St, Stamford, CT, 06926-317. This is not a formal solicitation or request for quote.

Contractors who can provide ACE-IT with Postage and Metering Services and Equipment, in accordance with the synopsis listed above, are invited to electronically submit an affirmative, written response indicating a bona fide ability to meet this specific requirement. Under the authority of 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), the government intends to make this sole-source award to Pitney Bowes Inc., because Pitney Bowes mail equipment is already in-place at USACE mailrooms. Pitney Bowes equipment is proprietary; the company does not authorize any other firm to provide maintenance for Pitney Bowes equipment, nor do they have any authorized resellers for the hardware itself. Additionally, Pitney Bowes is currently the only company Authorized by the USPS (Domestic Mail Manual 300 paragraph 604.4.1.3) as both a mail meter provider and a PC Postage provider</p>
<p>Contractors wishing to receive a copy of the solicitation, once it is available, should submit a request to the contract specialist and contracting officer identified later in this synopsis.</p>
<p>Responses should appear on company letterhead and include, at minimum, affirmation of active registration in the System for Award Management (SAM), your Data Universal Number System (DUNS) number, any applicable processed credentials and qualifications, and any applicable pricing data or information. All responses should include a point of contact, telephone number, and electronic mail address. Additionally, respondents should indicate whether they are a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) concern, women owned small business, HUBZone, service disabled veteran-owned small business, or qualify as socially or economically disadvantaged and whether they are U.S. or foreign owned.

<DESC>NAVSUP Fleet Logistic Center San Diego – Seal Beach Detachment intends to issue a sole source purchase order in accordance with FAR Part 12 and Part 13 to Lyme Computer Systems, 18 On The Common, Lyme, NH, 03768. The proposed contract action is for an annual license renewals, maintenance and support of the Dassault Systèmes SOLIDWORKS Corp software which supports NAVFAC EXWC’s real time data delivery for the Oceans Department.

The government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 and as implemented under FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).

The Solidworks software is proprietary to Dassault Systemes and is currently installed as NAVFAC EXWC’s primary tool for modeling and oceanic research.
  This software delivers data to EXWC customers worldwide and required to continue modeling and analysis. License renewals and patch updates are required to keep this software in use, up to date and accurate.  Changing NAVFAC EXWC’s modeling software would require an entire overhaul of existing systems and require exorbitant man-hours of system engineering, putting operational NAVFAC EXWS Oceans Department capabilities and accuracies at risk. Accordingly, Lyme Computer Systems is the sole authorized distributor of this software in the Port Hueneme, CA territory.  

THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.
 Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties shall submit information that indicates their ability to satisfy this requirement via e-mail to melissa.ferri@navy.mil. Requests must include company name, address, POC name, telephone number, CAGE Code, DUNS number, NAICS code, applicable business size, and Tax ID number. Responses are due by September 29th, 2017, 12:00 PM, Pacific Standard Time. 

If no responses are received, FLCSD-Seal Beach will proceed with the sole source award

The Contractor shall notify the contracting office in writing within the timeframes specified in paragraph (b) of this clause that the data have been validated or updated, and provide the date of the validation or update.</p>
<p>(f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause.</p>

There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com.Sellers that are not currently registered to use www.FedBid.com should proceed to www.FedBid.com to complete their free registration. Sellers that require special considerations or assistance may contact the FedBid Helpdesk at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or via email at clientservices@fedbid.com. Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means. It is unacceptable to place bad faith bids, to use decoys in the www.FedBid.com process or to collude with the intent or effect of hampering the competitive www.FedBid.com process.Should Sellers require additional clarification, contact FedBid at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or clientservices@fedbid.com.<BR><BR>Use of FedBid:   Buyers and Sellers agree to conduct this transaction through FedBid in compliance with the FedBid Terms of Use. Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive.<BR>In addition to providing pricing at www.FedBid.com for this solicitation, each Offeror must provide any required, NON-PRICING responses (e.g. technical proposal, representations and certifications, etc.) so that they are received no later than the closing date and time for this solicitation; these can be submitted to clientservices@fedbid.com.<BR><BR>This solicitation requires registration with the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to award, pursuant to FAR 4.1102 and other applicable regulations and guidelines. Information can be found at www.sam.gov. Registration must be "ACTIVE" at the time of award.<BR><BR>All Bids must be valid for 60 days from the closing date for this solicitation. No exceptions or qualifications.<BR><BR>New equipment ONLY, NO grey market or refurbished products. Items must be in original packaging, never used, and not altered in any way.

All items must be covered by manufacturer’s warranty and procured through a manufacturer approved distribution channel. Sellers must be able to document their ability to provide items through manufacturer approved distribution channels upon request.

The Seller confirms to have sourced all products submitted in this Bid from manufacturer-approved channels for Federal sales, in accordance with all applicable laws and manufacturer’s current applicable policies at the time of purchase. Seller must be able to support both the product sale and product pricing, in accordance with applicable manufacturer certification / specialization requirements.

No partial shipments are permitted, unless otherwise specified by Contracting Officer at time of award.<BR><BR>Delivery order awards shall only be made to the firm that has the specified GWAC contract associated with this solicitation. The Government views a team arrangement as a prime and subcontractor relationship with the delivery/task order only being awarded to one GWAC contract holder. To ensure compliance, prior to award the offeror MUST provide written proof from the prime GWAC contract holder that they have the right to offer the items/services from this GWAC contract on behalf of the primary GWAC contract holder; AND a statement that the offeror accepts that the government will make award to the prime GWAC contract holder as the sole awardee and they understand the Government will only accept invoices from and make payments to the prime GWAC contract holder. ATTENTION: Should a solicitation be set aside for a specific socio-economic status, such as a small business, the prime GWAC contract holder must meet the socio-economic requirement in order to be considered for award.  This includes but is not limited to all GWACs such as: Alliant, 8(a) STARS II, OASIS, NASA SEWP V, NITAAC, etc.<BR><BR>GSA schedule orders may include "open market" items, i.e., items not on the awardee's list of GSA schedule items, only in compliance with FAR 8.402(f). Offerors should verify in writing which items are listed on their GSA schedule contracts and which items are "open market" items. For an offer to qualify as an offer based on a GSA schedule contract, the value of "open market" items included in the offer may not exceed the applicable micro-purchase threshold as defined in FAR 2.101.
In order to notate which items are open market, in accordance with FAR 8.402(f)(3), Seller must write "open market" in the Line Item Description for any item not currently active on the cited contract, or list in the Seller Bid Description field all open market line numbers (e.g. "Open Market Items: Lines 1, 2, 3.")<BR><BR>Delivery order awards shall only be made to the firm that has the GSA FSS contract awarded to them. The Government views a team arrangement as a prime and subcontractor relationship with the delivery order only being awarded to one GSA FSS holder. To ensure compliance, prior to award the offeror MUST provide written proof from the GSA FSS contract holder that they have the right to offer the GSA schedule items on behalf of the GSA FSS holder; AND a statement that the offeror accepts that the government will make award to the GSA schedule contract holder as the sole awardee and they understand the Government will only accept invoices from and make payments to the GSA FSS contract holder. ATTENTION: Should a solicitation be set aside for a specific socio-economic status, such as a small business, the FSS contract holder must meet the socio-economic requirement in order to be considered for award.<BR><BR>To be considered for award, all Sellers must be manufacturer federally authorized distributors/resellers of the equipment/services they are offering with a demonstrated capability of delivering the entire order within the timeframes specified by the Buyer on the award. Sellers shall be required to provide documentation as proof of authorization to be considered for award.<BR><BR>(4) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror’s initial proposal should contain the offeror’s best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.<BR><BR>
