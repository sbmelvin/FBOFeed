<SOLNBR>DAAD16-R-TBD-BUSS DUCT
<RESPDATE>071403
<ARCHDATE>09122003
<CONTACT>Thomas Bouchard, (508) 233-4026
<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Robert Morris Acquisition Center Ã¢Â€Â“ Natick Contracting Division (NCD) in support of the U.S. Army Soldier Systems Center (SSC) and the United States Marine Corps (USMC), has a requirement for a commercial electrical power distribution bus s (buss ducts) for use with the USMC new containerized Field Food Service System (FFSS).  The FFSS consists of one (1) Marine Rapid Deployment Kitchen (MRDK) and one (1) Field Sanitation Unit (FSU). The buss duct should distribute sufficient power to fully  operate the complete FFSS for its entire operational cycle.  The minimum operational cycle time period is approximately eight hours per day, while the expected operational cycle time period is 24 hours per day.  The FFSS will normally be employed as a com plete system. However, some operational scenarios may require the system to be separated into its two components.  The buss duct must be able to supply power to the complete FFSS, as well as to the MRDK and FSU operating independently of one another. The M RDK or FSU operating independently of one another means that only one of the two components would be equipped with the buss duct.  All power is three phase, and electric cables that connect to the buss duct are provided with the cable ends bare.  The MRDK and FSU maximum power draw is 198 KW, 144KW for the MRDK and 54KW for the FSU.  The MRDK has four individual electrical cables and a separate ground.  The FSU has a four-cable bundle and a separate ground.  The buss ducts shall have the capability to accom modate (connect) three 100 Kilowatt (KW) or three 60 KW Marine Corps generators in parallel and simultaneously distribute and deliver sufficient power to fully operate the entire FFSS or each subsystem (MRDK/FSU) independently. Both the 100 KW and 60 KW ge nerators are three phase, 120/208 volts, 60 Hertz, and four wires and a ground will connect from the generators to the buss duct.  Candidate buss duct will also include a 60KW output for a refrigeration box when the buss duct is operating in the three 100 KW generator configuration.  This requirement is a 100% Small Business Set-aside. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 335999, small business size standard is 500 employees. Firms shall not be reimbursed for any cost s associated with proposals. The Government intends this procurement to be a commercial item acquisition utilizing both, Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR SUBPART 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial I tems. The Government envisions that a single Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract will be awarded as a result of the Request for Proposal with one 5-year ordering period. The Government envisions one CLIN for the b uss duct. It is anticipated that the Minimum Guaranteed will be 18 each buss ducts, with a Maximum of 80 each buss ducts.  It is anticipated that as part of any evaluation, the Government will visit the manufacturers to inspect and witness the operation of  an offerorÃ¢Â€Â™s proposed buss duct. The Government reserves the right to make any changes to this information upon release of the solicitation. In accordance with FAR 5.102(d), when released, the solicitation, including all amendments, and applicable do cuments will only be available in electronic medium at the US Army RMAC-NCD web page at https://www3.natick.army.mil. NOTE: THIS IS NOT THE SOLICITATION.

<DESC>NA The Northern Region Contracting Center, Mission Support Division, Fort Leavenworth, KS, is seeking sources among GSA schedule contractors.  The service requested is analytical support for the Army Transformation Concept Development and Experimentation Prog ram (AT-CDEP) and American, British, Canadian and Australian (ABCA) Armies Interoperability Exercise Program.  The vendor must have operational experience with Objective Force concepts within battle command scenarios.  Specifically, the vendorÃ¢Â€Â™s opera tional experience should include:  1) at least two years of objective force battle command concept and implementation experience; 2) experience in planning and coordinating objective force battle command experiments and actual participation in at least one  objective force battle command experiment that included human-in-the-loop role players, C2 devices, and an objective force federation of models; 3) experience in coalition planning to include on site participation with any of the ABCA nations, and 4) at l east one year of experience with objective force scenario development.   This project is a continuation of the Analytic Support for the Command and Control, Communications, Computers Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Modeling and Analys is Working Group (MAWG) Program.  In the C4ISR experiment, the aim was to see how C4ISR impacted the unit of action (UA) commander's ability to command and control his unit.  The contractor was Booz-Allen and Hamilton.  The current requirement, Army Transf ormation Concept Development and Experimentation Program (AT-CDEP), addresses the human-in-the-loop (HITL) process.  The human inter-action required for interface with the  model and/or simulation.  This means a willful, decision-processed action must occu r before the simulation can proceed.  Typically, the HITL process includes battle command decisions; applying the art of war more than the science.  Responsibilities include perform tasks associated with the development and management of the analysis porti on of the Army Transformation Concept Development and Experimentation Program (AT-CDEP).  Tasks include developing and coordinating the analysis plan to ensure synchronization with TRADOCÃ¢Â€Â™s experiment plan and to ensure level of analytic rigor that is  planned can support required transformation decisions.  The deliverable is an analysis annex to the AT-CDEP.   Perform tasks associated with the development, management and execution of the Integrated Study Plan (ISP) in support of Army experimentation. Develop and coordinate the ISP with TRADOC staff and subordinate battle labs to ensure a synchronous body of analysis is produced from several experiment venues.  Deliverable is the ISP and its continuous refinement.  Conduct scenario development in suppor t of Army and joint experimentation integrating events.  Develop scenarios that will support experimental events in FY04 and coordinate with multiple TRADOC battle labs to ensure consistency among different experiment venues.  Deliverable is a scenario tha t will support FY04 experimental events.   Provide support to develop and manage a database management tool that harvests, stores, and disseminates critical analytic insights that underpin objective force requirements.  Provide developmental and analytic s upport to the Australian British Canadian American (ABCA) cooperative interoperability experiments that will take place June 2004.  This task requires review and de-confliction of four separate nationsÃ¢Â€Â™ analysis and data collection plans in order to e nable sufficient resources for exercise execution.   Provide planning and execution support, to the Army Transformation Exercise 2004 (ATEX04) that will take place September 2004.  The complete requirements are included in the Statement of Work (SOW).  The  Federal Supply Classification (FSC) code for this project is R421, NAICS code is 541519, and SIC code is 7379.  If no responsive/responsible replies are receiv ed, an order will be negotiated with Booz-Allen and Hamilton under GSA contract GS-35F-0306J for these services.  All responses will be considered and must include proof of the ability to provide analytical support for the Army Transformation Concept Devel opment and Experimentation Program (AT-CDEP) and American, British, Canadian and Australian (ABCA) Armies Interoperability Exercise Program including performance information and references on the contractorÃ¢Â€Â™s abilities.  The response should also provi de GSA schedule, contract labor categories and rates for this service.   All responses must include company name, address, POC, phone number, fax number, email address, business size, taxpayer identification number, DUNS number and CAGE code.  All contract ors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration at http://www.ccr.dlis.dla.mil/ccr/scripts/index.html.  All responses must be received no later than 12:00 p.m. CDT, on 10 June 03.
