<p>Lightning protection and grounding will be required in accordance with the Statement of Work</p>
<p>NOTE: The government will consider other types of shelters provided they meet or exceed the required standards and represent "Best Value" to the government.<br /><br />Due to mandated timelines, potential contractors will submit price and installation proposals for government consideration as follows:</p>
<p>Purchase and installation complete within 30 days after award:</p>
<p>PRICE: ________</p>
<p>Purchase and installation complete within 45 days after award:</p>
<p>PRICE: ________</p>
<p>Purchase and installation complete within 60 days after award:</p>
<p>PRICE: ________</p>
<p>Purchase and installation complete within 90 days after award:</p>
<p>PRICE: ________</p>
<p>Purchase and installation complete within 120 days after award:</p>
<p>PRICE: ________</p>
<p>ADDED: The government may require expedited delivery, extended work hours and holiday work; therefore these added costs should be incorporated in the proposal. The government will select the proposal and timeline that represents best value and will adjust the performance period to best match the government's requirement.</p>
<p>This announcement constitutes the only synopsis. This requirement is 100% set-aside for small businesses. The resultant contract will be a Firm-Fixed price commercial contract that will include appropriate construction clauses and provisions. The North American Industrial Classification Code is 332311 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. The estimated magnitude of cost for the proposed acquisition is between $250,000 and $500,000.</p>
<p>Since material supply restrictions and on-site installation tasks will involve construction (i.e. alteration to real property--concrete ramp modifications, structural and electrical work etc.), in which aggregate labor costs for all trades will exceed $2,000, Davis Bacon (FAR 22.403-1) and Berry Amendment (DFAR 252.225-7014) rules apply. Successful contractor shall comply with all contract provisions, clauses, and other applicable laws and regulations relating to wages, fringe benefits, apprentices, documentation, and other requirements. Certified payrolls will be required from both the prime and any subcontractors working on the project. In addition, the contractor shall certify compliance with Berry Amendment when submitting a proposal.</p>
<p>In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items, the Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to a responsible offeror, whose offer conforms to the solicitation and provides the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered. Best value means the expected outcome of an acquisition that, in the Government's estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement. In determining the best value, the government shall consider Price and Past Performance. NOTE: Past performance will be significantly more important than Price when being evaluated. Past performance questionnaire submissions will be required before the due date of the proposal. The government will query past performance references submitted.</p>
<p><br />Funds are not currently available for this solicitation. Award as a result of this solicitation is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds. There shall be no legal liability on the part of the Government for contract purposes until funds are made available to the contracting officer. The contracting officer will confirm availability of funds in writing to the contractor upon award.</p>
<p>A formal site visit will be conducted. A Pre-Site Visit Conference Meeting will be held at the Sheppard AFB Base Contracting Office Auditorium, Bldg 1664, 136 K Ave, Suite 1. This meeting will provide an overview of the project and will allow for accountability and transportation arrangements (Government Bus) to the project site. All site visit attendees will require physical escort to the project area. Privately owned vehicles will not be allowed on the aircraft parking ramp. Site visit and conference meeting dates/times will be finalized in the solicitation.</p>
<p>All information required for submission of an offer will be identified in the Request for Proposal (RFP). Interested parties must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) as prescribed in DFARS 252.204-7004. CCR can be accessed at https://www.bpn.gov/ or by calling 1-888-227-2423. The CCR registration must be completed before award can be made. All prospective offerors interested in submitting a proposal must have a commercial and government entity code.</p>
<p>The anticipated issue date of solicitation FA3020-09-R-0018 is on or about 15 July 2009. The RFP will be issued electronically and may be accessed and downloaded at the following web address: http://www.fbo.gov/. NO HARD COPIES will be provided by the issuing office. Once the solicitation is posted, it is incumbent upon the interested parties to review this site frequently for updates or amendments to any and all documents. All responsible sources may submit a proposal that will be considered by this Agency. Proposal submission due date will be finalized in the solicitation.</p>

<DESC><p>The Space and Missile Center intends to solicit and negotiate with the incumbent contractor, Honeywell Technology Solutions, Inc. (HTSI), under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source, for the purchase of one Transportable Remote Tracking Station Block Change (TRBC) Core Electronics Configured Item (CI) van otherwise known as the RBC TSTR. HTSI is currently on contract to develop and deliver the TRBC. The RBC TSTR will be an exact duplicate of the TRBC Core CI van which is one of three vans that make up the TRBC. Delivery is estimated at 20 months after contract award.
<p>The RBC TSTR consists of telemetry, tracking, and commanding (TT&amp;C) core electronics hardware and software/firmware subsystems that represent the functionality of an RBC and is integrated into a single van for land, air, and sea shipment.</p>
<p>The AFSCN is the DoD's primary network for launch and early orbit operations. The AFSCN provides telemetry, tracking, and commanding capability, mission data dissemination and processing, and is the world's only high-powered network for emergency recovery of DoD space vehicles. The RBC TSTR is a key component that will be used to test satellite compatibility with the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) RBC system either in the factory (Factory Compatibility Test) or at the launch site (Launch-Based Compatibility Test).</p>
<p>Currently the AFSCN consists of legacy Automated Remote Tracking Stations (ARTS) and is modernizing to state-of-the-art tracking stations through the Remote Tracking Station (RTS) Block Change (RBC) projects. The RBC TSTR will become the only dedicated hi-fidelity compatibility test resource.</p>
<p><br />The purpose of the RBC TSTR is to verify compatibility between satellites and the AFSCN's RBC architecture prior to launch. The RBC TSTR must be an exact replica of the RBC architecture as manufactured by HTSI. If the RBC TSTR system performance differs slightly from the RBC system, it may result in either a "false negative" or a "false positive" response. A "false negative" response could result in the satellite's program office expending valuable resources (time, money and personnel) to fix a satellite that is operating correctly. A "false positive" response may not be discovered until the satellite is at the launch site and could lead to expensive, time consuming launch slips. Additionally, a "false positive" response may not be detected until after the launch and result in extensive on-orbit anomaly resolution procedures.</p>
<p>One of the key test principles espoused in AFI 99-103 CAPABILITIES-BASED TEST AND EVALUATION is to test in an operationally-representative environment using operationally-representative equipment. The Space Vehicles Test and Evaluation Handbook TOR-2006 (8546)-4591, written by Aerospace Corporation funded by SMC and NRO, states the need for using high-fidelity test assets that are as close to the operational system possible as the program matures. This includes having the same configuration as the operational system (Chapter 27 Inter-Segment Testing). Having a RBC TSTR core electronics suite that is the exact same as the RBC core electronics suite would allow RBC TSTR's tests to be qualified as high-fidelity. A RBC TSTR developed by any company other than HTSI could only be considered capable of providing a low-fidelity test; therefore, defeating the purpose of trying to test in an operationally-representative environment.</p>
<p>The above information is the Government's rationale for intending to negotiate with only one source, HTSI. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement within 15 days of issuance of this synopsis. The capability statement must include a discussion on how the results of any other system than the HTSI developed RBC TSTR could be considered high fidelity in an operationally-representative environment. All capability statements should be submitted to the contracting office address.</p>
<p>This notice is not a Request for Proposal. Any information submitted by respondents to this synopsis is strictly voluntary. The Government will not pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to this notice. NAICS is 541712 - Small Business Size Standard is 1,000 employees.</p>

Following these presentations, selection of the five most highly rated offerors will be made for negotiations towards award.While no socio-economic set-aside is announced for this solicitation, the Government does intend to give weight to the socio-economic category of each offeror.  If three or more offers are received from one socio-economic group (e.g., Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business), the Government may elect to consider only that socio-economic category for award of one or more award slots.  In accordance with the Brooks Act, at least three offers from any socio-economic category must be received for consideration of a set-aside.  Additionally, socio-economic offerors must be evaluated as technically acceptable to count towards the required three offers necessary for a set-aside.  Technically acceptable is defined as an average overall shortlist rating of 60 or more out of 146 possible points.  The standard VA Office of Construction and Facilities Management score sheets shall be used for both phases of evaluation.  Blank copies of these forms are available upon request for potential offerors.  Preference will be given to emerging small business concerns per the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration program, provided three or more offerors meet the criteria of an emerging small business.  Awards shall NOT be set aside for small business concerns, due to the restrictions stipulated in FAR 19.10.  In decreasing order of preference, the following socio-economic categories will be given preference for award:1.	Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business/Emerging Small Business2.	Veteran Owned Small Business3.	HUBZONE Business 4.	MBE/8a/Small Disadvantaged Business/Women-Owned Small BusinessPLACE OF CONTRACT PERFORMANCE:	Samuel S.

The products from this project will support ongoing studies to assess and improve water quality in the upper Klamath River reach.  Critical to this work is the release of the draft Klamath River Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) study, which is scheduled to occur in June, 2009, as well as ongoing efforts under the settlement process wherein PacifiCorp Dams are considered for removal.  The timeliness of this work is paramount to providing critical information to these processes, as well as other regulatory actions (e.g., Biological Opinions, completed TMDLs, and other actions).   The contract duration is contemplated for no less than 300 calendar days and no more than 365 calendar days.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541330.

The following items are required for all interested vendors: Central Contract Registration (CCR) and Annual Representations and Certifications, as required by FAR 4.1102, apply to this procurement: Vendors must be registered prior to award.

<DESC>Contractor shall assemble and summarize relevant past and ongoing young growth monitoring that pertains to wildlife on the Tonasss National.  From that information develop monitoring protocols for the Forest Plan monitoring questions.

1. Following young-growth treatments, does the cahnge in understory vegeation provide improved habitat for key old-growth species?
	Identify a monitoring protocol for understory vegetation (vegetation alone).
	Determine the feasibility for developing correlates between vegetation and an agreed upon list of species, following the process steps in Appendix A
	Because we do not have information to suggest direct habitat improvement or population responses to changes in understory vegetation for most MIS and other species of concern, and because research supports positive benefits with changes in understory vegetation for Sitka black-tailed deer, the initial focus will be on deer.  Other emphasis species may be identified after the assemblage of literature.
 

2.  Is old growth structure retained in the matrix adequate and is it representative of old growth types across VCUs and across the Forest?

	The protocol could identify simple spatial queries for agreed upon old growth structural classes (based on the Tongass Size-Density Model)

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) intends to purchase sequencing services of Illumina, Inc., 9885 Towne Centre Drive, San Diego, CA 92121-1975. The Institute intends to purchase this service by other than full and open competition under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 6.302. The needed services include:

1.	Item# DS-101-1002 - Single Read Seq (250Mb) Library Construction by customer.   Resequencing dataset of Clonal Single Molecule Array signature tags of 50nt length resulting in at least 250 Mega bases of sequence per sample, QTY (8 EA)
2.	Item# SW-600-1004  - GenomeStudio DNA Sequencing Module (1-Seat) 

Illumina Inc is the only company that provides the number of sequence reactions needed for our experiment at the NICHD.  Illumina will provide these services using Illuminas proprietary technology.  This experimental approach is a high throughput application to identify all genes in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (S. pombe) required to survive conditions of stress.  The lab at the NICHD has developed a mutagenesis tool for the fission yeast S. pombe using the Hermes transposon.  The lab will introduce Hermes into a culture of cells to allow transposition to occur.     The final culture will include cells with insertions at millions of unique sites in the genome and not insertions into genes required to survive the specific stress.  In order to saturate the genome and identify statistically significant gaps, we will need to identify the positions of 5-10 million integrations events using ultra high throughput sequencing technology. For the experiment the overall number of sequence reads is very critical. Using sequencing services from Illumina will provide the easiest and the most cost effective way to sequence 5-10 million integration events which is an important factor as well.
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations however, all responses received, within 7 days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.     A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition is based upon responses to this notice and is solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition.    
Offerors may request a copy of the Request for Quotation (RFQ) in writing to the Contracting Office Address listed or via email to:  robinsti@mail.nih.gov prior to the closing date of this notice or before July 13, 2009 @ 3:00 pm EST.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOLE / SINGLE SOURCE, NON-COMPETITIVE NOTICE.   This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. This sole / single source, non-competitive notice is prepared in accordance FAR Parts 5 and 13.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.   FAR Part 6  Competition Requirements, is not applicable to contracts awarded using the simplified acquisition procedures of FAR Part 13, not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.      

This announcement constitutes the only notice; proposals are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   

The resultant acquisition will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-33.

The total estimated amount of this contract is NOT expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold of $100,000.00. 

The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System code 325414 with size standard of 500 employees.

Market Research conducted by the Government in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 10, Market Research, has determined that the sole / single source reference, is currently the only company that can provide the services / items specified herein. 

THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisition (OA) for the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)  intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a sole source noncompetitive basis to Sigma-Aldrich, 3050 Spruce Street, Saint Louis, MO 63103 for (2) two Custom Zinc Finger Nucleases, CSTZFN-1KT. These custom-designed primers that allow for determination of the rate of mutation and for screening of individual clones that have the desired mutational event.  Sigma-Aldrich will design and test several ZFN pairs for two target genes identified by the customer, this will complement the on-going resequencing project recently developed.

The sole source determination is based upon the results of the market research conducted by the Government which determined that Sigma-Aldrich is the only   vendor that currently holds exclusive commercial rights to  zinc-finger nuclease  technology for research purposes under licenses granted and/or sublicensed from Sangamo Biosciences, John Hopkins University, MIT, Scripps, the University of Utah, the MRC, and Caltech.    Sigma-Aldrich is the only worldwide commercial source of  zinc finger nucleases for research use.  

Therefore, an award to any other source is not feasible or practical. The contract will be awarded using the simplified acquisition procedures of FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisition Procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 - Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001). 

Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit a response.   This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Responses to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NHLBI-PB-(HG)-2009-210-TMB may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisitions, Procurement Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6042, Bethesda, MD 20892-7902, Attention: Tracy Brooks.  Responses may be submitted electronically to brookstr@nhlbi.nih.gov.  Responses will only be accepted if dated and signed by an authorized company representative.  Responses are due July 14, 2009.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.   A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Branch, Office of Acquisitions intends to negotiate a 9 month extension to the contract with Jackson Laboratory of Bar Harbor, Maine to continue operations of the Mouse Model Repository for Cytogenetic Disorders.  The planned extension will permit the repository to continue to function while a new acquisition is conducted for these services.  The proposed extension will prevent a lapse in service until a new competitive contract can be awarded and the services transitioned. 

The requirements of the contract are:  
1)  Continue maintenance of the Repository for Mouse Models of Cytogenetic Disorders or Cytogenetic Resource.  
2)  Breed various strains of mice with known genetic background, which will produce chromosomally unbalanced gametes, resulting in trisomic and monosomic embryos with special emphasis on chromosome 16, but including relevant regions of chromosome 17 and chromosome 10.  
3)  Continue to refine procedures to freeze embryos that can be rescued by thawing and reimplanting them in pseudopregnant mice.  
4)  Distribute the animal models to qualified investigators by NICHD. Test the animals periodically for pathogens.  
5)  Publicize the availability of mouse models indicating the type of strains in the colony.  
6)  Continue to characterize the clinical phenotypes of the mouse models.  

Statutory authority: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The contractor is uniquely qualified by virtue of its continued performance over this period of time and is the only source that can provide the mouse models for the following reasons:  A new contractor would have to develop cryopreservation, and maintenance techniques unique to the type of mice in this resource, specifically strains with chromosome aberrations.  One would have to acknowledge and plan for the time needed to learn procedures involved in cryopreservation and maintenance of these strains.  There would be little room for developing the unique skills associated with cryopreservation of the Robertsonian (Rb) and partially trisomic embryos that could result in a significant loss of the frozen stocks in the resource.  Researchers rely on the resource to obtain segmental trisomy and Rb mice primarily for studies related to Down Syndrome.  Over the past five years over 144 requests for mice from researchers have been fulfilled.   A variety of studies using these mice are on-going.   Investigators require a foundation colony from which different stocks are derived so genetic drift does not occur among different colonies.  If another contractor were to be awarded the proposed extension it would take approximately one-year for them to transfer and process the mice, thereby disrupting the distribution of the mice to researchers and potentially impacting their research.   If the mice were to survive the transfer it is not known if another contractor could consistently duplicate the characteristics of the mouse models currently maintained at the Jackson Laboratory.  This would create unacceptable delays in fulfilling the governments requirements.   In addition, it would take another contractor approximately $1M to transfer the mice that would result in a duplication of costs that is not expected to be recovered through competition.   However, if there are sources who feel they are able to perform the requirement, they must respond by submitting information (5 page limit) required in Numbered Note 22 within 45 days of publication of this synopsis. 

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The capability statement will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

Overnight deliveries should be mailed to the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Contracts Management Branch, 6100 Executive Boulevard, Suite 7A07, Bethesda, Maryland 20852.  No collect calls or facsimile transmissions will be accepted. Respondents may submit their capability statements via email in addition to 2 hard copies

<DESC><p>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) intends to negotiate with Biotechnical Services Inc. (BSI) to complete document preparation for the National Toxicology Program technical reports started on the now-expired Contract Number N01-ES-05453.
<p>The requirement consists of conversion of peer-reviewed draft reports prepared by BSI into galley drafts, which includes incorporation of revisions by the study scientist addressing the comments of the Board of Scientific Counselors Technical Reports Review Subcommittee, and/or conversion of galley drafts into print- and web-ready files. The Government estimates that approximately 1080 direct hours of work will likely be involved in the completion of the reports, depending upon the substance of the government's final review. The NAICS code is 511130, Book Publishers.</p>
<p>BSI is the only source known that can meet the above requirements. The draft reports were prepared on the QuarkXPress desktop publishing system. Involvement of a third party would necessitate a complex transition that is anticipated to consume more time than the actual completion of the documents themselves. For this reason, BSI possesses unique capabilities, as the original preparer of the draft reports, to complete the reports upon final government review.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Patuxent River, Maryland, intends to issue a sole source contract to Lockheed Martin Corporation, 230 Mall Blvd, King of Prussia, PA for continued support of the PEO(U&W) PMA 280 Tomahawk Weapon Control System program.  Tomahawk is the deep strike weapon system resident on many Navy ships and submarines.  This contract includes the continued sustainment support of deployed Fleet assets, and the completion of modifications already in work to the existing Tomahawk Tactical Weapons Control System (TTWCS) software.  This effort will also address obsolescence, system redundancies, new hull unique requirements, and government mandates.  Support of deployed Fleet assets shall include investigation, analysis, implementation, and testing of software changes required to correct mission critical deficiencies.  Obsolescence shall be addressed by modifying the existing hardware dependent software to execute in a hardware independent environment and replacing obsolete GOTS and COTS software components so that producible systems can be acquired for new hulls beginning in FY12.   Modifications to remove functionality duplicated in the Tactical Command and Control System (TC2S) includes the deletion of existing functions from TTWCS and replacing them with TC2S web services.  Additional software changes will be made to meet new hull unique requirements such as DDG1000 and to comply with Government mandated requirements.  This system modification and life cycle support will be implemented via a phased approach with TTWCS version 5.4.0 currently in test and version 5.4.1 in development.  Lockheed Martin Corporation is the only known source that possesses the knowledge of the TTWCS design, operation requirements, capability, and expertise required to successfully provide these supplies and services in an accurate and timely manner to meet the required Government schedule for continued Fleet support of this critical war-fighting capability.  The estimated contract period of performance shall include a one year effort along with four priced option years.   Notes 22 and 26 apply.

<DESC>This synopsis provides notice of the Governments intent to solicit a proposal on a sole source basis from Booz Allen Hamilton Inc. (BAH), 8283 Greensboro Drive, Mclean, VA 22102-4904, for 104,760 man hours of Engineering, Technical, Management and Professional services to support the Special Communications Requirement Division of Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division,  United States Central Command (USCENTCOM) supporting United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), the Family of Special Operations Vehicles (FOSOV), and the Joint Base Station (JBS) Radio Integration System efforts under contract N00421-06-C-0003.  This acqisition will result in the modification of existing Booz Allen Hamilton contract N00421-06-C-0003 adding and exercising a cost plus fixed fee level of effort Option V with a period of performance that will run from 16 October 2009 to 01 April 2010.

Due to the on-going nature of the projects currently being done under contract N00421-06-C-0003 and the need to continue these services without a break in the work, BAH is the only practical source for providing the necessary continuation of these services until award of a follow-on contract.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  However, responsible interested parties may submit a proposal in which they identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.

<DESC>This is a NOTICE OF INTENT for sole source procurement of commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 and Part 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.   The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of Section 4202 Clinger Cohen Act of 1996, as set forth in FAR Part 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements.  Hazelden Foundation of Center City, MN is currently the only known source providing a web-based Continuing After-Care Program for substance abuse patients that is compatible with the program implemented by the Navy's Substance Abuse Recovery Program.  This announcement constitutes the only notice of intent.
The Department of Navy (DoN), Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, National Naval Medical Center, Acquisition Management Service, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Hazelden for a web-based Continuing After-Care Program for substance abuse patients that is compatible with the program implemented by the Navy's Substance Abuse Recovery Program.  The period of performance is ten months  to customize the current program and pilot the system, then four one-year options for upgrades and licenses to access the system.  Identified DoN users (Sailors, Marines, and their dependents) will have access to this continuing after-care recovery program immediately after they have completed their primary treatment, therefore it is a continuation of the program adopted by the Navy in conjunction with previous Hazelden contracts.  It must be an on-line web-based program that will improve patient outcomes by giving patients access to evidence-based support as they return to their bases and ships anywhere in the world through the use of web technology.   The DoN users must be segregated from all others using the site so that the programs utilized are limited to only DoN and the tracking of progress and measuring of statistics are based on only the DoN population.  The program will include substance abuse continuing after-care recovery tools which were developed exclusively by Hazelden and which form the basis for the Navy's SARP Program, suicide prevention mechanisms, and AA-type web meetings exclusively for DoN participants.  The web site must also allow for accessibility by Navy supervising staff to review in order to track participant recovery.
Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by sending challenges to Leanne Hanger at leanne.hanger@navy.mil.  This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals; however, all challenges to this sole source determination received within 3 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract (or purchase order) based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<CONTACT>Jenny  n Rieck, Contract Specialist, Phone 703-601-9462, Fax 703-601-9473, Email jenny.rieck@ssp.navy.mil
<DESC><p><br />The Strategic Systems Programs (SSP) intends to issue a sole source contract to Northrop Grumman Information Systems (NGIS) for system hardware and software engineering, technical support and disaster recovery services for the SSP financial planning system, REMIS (Resource Management Information System) System. The contract will be for 1 year (FY10) plus 4 Option Years FY11-14. REMIS is an enterprise application and failure of this application would adversely affect the organization's ability to complete the SSP Mission.
<p>SSP has a requirement to keep REMIS operational until the arrival of NAVY's Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) in 2013. NGIS is the only known source capable of meeting this requirement. NGIS together with its predecessor organization, have supported REMIS continuously since its inception, and possesses system manuals and documentation that are out of print and no longer available. They have specific expertise and experience with the versions of the database and operating systems that would be impossible to find elsewhere.</p>
<p>All of REMIS's component software and hardware is now unsupported by industry. The successful completion of the requirement, within the time frame required by this procurement request, is dependent upon existing historical knowledge, technical expertise and analytical approaches gained from performing the hardware and software system design and the continuing system support over the past twenty-plus years.</p>
<p><br />THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. However, all responses received within fifteen days of the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received as a result of the notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. See Numbered Note 22.</p>

An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activitys procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity.  The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application.

<DESC><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Chicago District issues a Pre-solicitation Notice for the Red Mill Pond Section 506, Great Lakes&nbsp;Fisheries &amp; Ecosystem and County Park in LaPorte, Indiana.&nbsp; The Contractor will be responsible for providing all of the necessary facilities, plants, labor, transportation, materials and equipment to perform the following:&nbsp;&nbsp;A new channel would be excavated and sculpted to pass flow from the pond to Little Calumet River. This also includes features such as grade control riffles, temporary erosion control features, and appropriate woody debris and vegetation for stabilization. The length of the new stream channels will be about 450-feet in length. A notched weir structure across the pond where a beaver dam currently sits would be constructed. This structure would ensure that current water levels and fluctuations are maintained. This structure would consist of a sheet pile wall that would be covered in glacial stone, woody debris and/or vegetation to make it look more natural. The small notch would allow a continuous flow down through the created stream channel. The length of the control structure is about 320-feet. Finally, the restoration of native vegetation communities in any area that is directly affected by the dam modification, stream channel formation and water draw down would be implemented. Appropriate vegetation communities would be planted according to hydrology. These are anticipated to be marsh, wet meadow and wet forest type communities. The total area affected is about 4-acres. Existing metal culverts would be replaced with 36" RCP pipe that would allow vehicles and people to walk the path without fording these small seep streams. By replacing the culvert, stream channel connectivity, hydrology and hydraulics would be restored. Appropriate native seep vegetation would be planted as well. This measure also ensures seeps would remain stable after the dam is bypassed.&nbsp; The classification code for this procurement is North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 237990, with a business size standard of $33.5M.&nbsp;COMPETITION IS UNRESTRICTED TO BUSINESS SIZE.&nbsp; The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers intends to award a firm-fixed price construction contract.&nbsp; The estimated price range for this project is between $500,000 and $1,000,000.&nbsp; Interested Contractors can download the Request for Proposal package from Internet Site <a href="http://www.fbo.gov/">www.fbo.gov</a> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>on or about July 24, 2009.&nbsp; The due date for proposals will be on August 25, 2009 at 4:00 p.m. Central Time Zone.&nbsp; Requests made by telephone, fax or e-mail will not be honored.&nbsp; The point of contact is Kim M. Beard, (312) 846-5378 and fax (312) 886-5475.&nbsp; The project specification files are Portable Document Format (PDF) files and can be viewed, navigated or printed using Adobe Acrobat Reader.&nbsp; Minimum system requirements are a 486 based personal computer, Microsoft Windows 3.1 or greater and 4 MB application RAM, 4MB hard disk space and compact disk drive.&nbsp;</span></p>

These performances present readings of Sophocles Ajax and Philoctetes depicting the psychological and physical wounds inflected upon soldiers by war, their loved ones and their families.

Sources responding to this announcement should indicate their size, particularly if they are a small business, a woman-owned small business, a HUBZone small business, a service-disabled veteran owned business or in the 8(a) program. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICs) code 336411, Aircraft Manufacturing applies to this acquisition with a size standard of 1,500 employees.

Please inform us if your firm intends to perform work as the prime contractor or if you desire to subcontract with a prime contractor.

<p><br />This sources sought notice is being conducted to identify potential sources that may possess the capability to provide a minimum of one (1) new C-40C aircraft with options to provide three (3) additional new C-40 aircraft for the support of the OSA/VIPSAM (Operational Support Aircraft/Very Important Persons Special Air Mission) missions.

The key performance parameters for this procurement are listed in the attached document "OSA/VIPSAM Minimum Capabilities Document". Sources must demonstrate the ability to provide all requirements listed above for the provision of the new aircraft.</p>
<p><br />This synopsis supersedes the requirements of the previous issued Sources Sought notice, dated 14 January 2009, for the acquisition of seven (7) OSA/VIPSAM aircraft.</p>
<p><br />A separate synopsis is being issued to provide full sustainment activities and modifications to the existing fleet of OSA/VIPSAM C-32 (four each) and C-40 aircraft (ten each), which will supersede the modification/sustainment requirements of the aforementioned 14 January 2009 synopsis.<br />A firm fixed price type contract is anticipated for this C-40 aircraft acquisition.</p>

<DESC>Justification For Other Than Full and Open CompetitionDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) OI&T Engineering Lab Upgrade1.  Agency:  Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA), Austin Automation Center (AAC)2.  Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Approved:  Use of brand-name specifications for the OI&T Innovation Lab Upgrade.   The equipment specified under the Engineering Test bed consist of HP specific computers, the legacy VMS operating system and software that will be used to enhance the existing test bed used by the OI&T Engineering and the Innovation Lab teams.  The system must mimic the current VA medical centers which are currently all running VMS on HP hardware.  The purpose of this lab is to create new software and test transition software so that it may be implemented seamlessly in the field.  It is imperative that the system be a clone of the current systems.   The compatibility with current systems, will minimize any unexpected problems that could lead to software that is not compatible or just wont run, or runs with errors.  None of the previous problems is acceptable for direct patient care systems.   The innovation lab will produce new applications that must fit exactly into the present VA computing environment.  That means in every way from compute nodes, to storage to backups.   That is why this procurement has several subcomponent aspects to it.  Those subcomponents are Processors (Itanium blades), Storage (EVA) and backups (tape libraries).   The follow describes each subcomponent and why any substitutions would create great risk and endanger patient safety.1)Computers:Need to procure 4 Itanium blade servers model 870s and necessary connectivity hardware and proprietary VMS software to run VA VistA applications.  The Itanium processors running VMS is the only viable upgrade path that requires no modification to existing VA VistA applications.  This system provides near 100% compatibility with the existing systems.  This platform is viable transition platform since the current system that utilize the Alpha chips are no longer manufactured.  The HP integrity BL870 has many unique characteristics it supports dual processor cores, and one to four processor modules and up to 192 gb RAM. The VA must have compatibility with current VMS supported architectures and for the ILO (integrated lights out management) of the systems.  The BL870 uses Intels  9100 series processors. Built for managing high-end applications and armed with advanced features that improve reliability and reduce power consumption, the 9100 series accentuates the ongoing shift from proprietary RISC products to the choice offered by Itanium-based servers. The 9100 series represents the sixth generation of Itanium chips.  The 9150N chip runs at 1.6 GHz, has 24MB L3 cache, and an FSB533.Integrity Integrated Lights-Out 2 (iLO 2) Advanced Pack (Factory integrated) is very important to the system maintenance and support of these systems and compatible with other existing HP hardware management tools.   The HP BladeSystem c-Class Onboard Administrator allow administration of the blade servers while the HP BladeSystem c-Class Virtual Connect allow virtual connection to system wide resources.  VMS is critical for compatibility with the existing Alpha VMS hardware that is presently deployed in the VA field.  The Itanium blades offer both the compatibility and functionality necessary to be able to run the VAs VistA system transparently. OpenVMS 8.3-1H1 runs on the BL870 and supports an extensive range management tools based on HP corporate Systems insight Manager (SIM). A whole new family of software providers enables system managers to interrogate components of blades, and systems such as CPU, memory, Management Processor etc. Moreover, the provisioning feature delivers the ability to Load OpenVMS onto a blade or system with one click from inside the HP SIM GUI interface.  This compatibility is extremely important to the VA for total system architecture and management. The BL860 Integrity system also benefit from these new capabilities with this release. Users are able to conveniently configure, deploy, and manage individual or groups of blade systems. Additionally, users are able to quickly set up logical collections of blade systems for convenient management and control. The use of SIM (which is free) ensures a common management interface or 'pane of glass' to virtually every HP server, reducing management training effort and complexity.  The VA runs Serviceguard on many devices and compatibility with other system components is essential. HP Serviceguard Manager is a graphical user interface (GUI) that provides configuration, administration, and monitoring capabilities for Serviceguard, Serviceguard Extension for RAC, Metrocluster, and Continental clusters. Using Serviceguard Manager, operators see color-coded icons that provide a big picture view of multiple clusters. From this big-picture view, operators can drill down and proactively manage clusters, systems (nodes), and packages that run applications.  This software feature is extremely important to the maintenance and operation of the system.  VMS provides a unique clustering, network and coding environment and there is custom code written in DCL (a batch control language) that performs critical system activities.   With VMS running Itaniums there would be little or no required changes to these critical infrastructure programs.  The VMS system also hosts Cache the Mumps language which is what the entire VistA system is constructed from.  Changes  to any of this infrastructure can cause code malfunctions that could endanger the lives of the VA patients.2)Storage  EVA  Enterprise Virtual ArrayNeed to procure an EVA 8100 storage area network (SAN).   This device is one of many devices in a family of storage devices provides by Hewlett Packard and is used to store vital patient data for VistA.   This system is needed to be compatible with all VistA storage architecture which uses the same controllers, device drivers and hard disks.The HP integrity The 8100 StorageWorks Enterprise Virtual Array family is an enterprise class storage array system designed to aggregate and automate SAN array management tasks to manage more storage capacity with fewer resources.  The EVA has deployed earlier models of this device in every medical center and it is a fundamental unit of storage in the VA VistA system.   EVA is designed specifically business critical applications like VistA and is a highly available and highly reliable "virtual" array storage solution.   This device is supported by a powerfully suite of management software making it easy for users to provision storage and the achieve highest level of productivity.  This software for management can draw from the models already in use in the earlier models (EVA5000/6000) that the VA already has in the field, this will enable use of the skills and knowledge that the operational field staff has.The Enterprise Virtual Array EVA family is designed for the data center where there is a critical need for improved storage utilization and scalability. The EVA meets application specific demands for transaction I/O performance for mid-range and enterprise customers. It provides easy capacity expansion, instantaneous replication, and simplified storage administration. The Enterprise Virtual Array combined with HP StorageWorks Command View EVA software provides a comprehensive solution designed to simplify management and maximize performance. With HP Storage Essentials Standard Edition SRM Software, you have an affordable and complete Storage Resource Management solution to efficiently manage EVA and SAN infrastructure via a unified and integrated server and storage, secure web-based tool set. Standard Edition SRM software is designed for small to medium HP Storage-based SANs and it discovers HP EVA and SAN infrastructure devices with a big picture topology view of the entire EVA ecosystem including HP EVA, HP MSA, and HP ProLiant Storage Servers (NAS), HBAs, servers and fabric switches, and it provides an holistic view of storage from the application level including Oracle, MS SQL, Exchange, InterSystems Cache' and Sybase for quicker problem resolution. The software solution reduces SAN complexity, helps optimizes SAN capacity, automates manual intensive tasks, increases IT staff efficiency and simplifies end-to-end troubleshooting monitoring and reporting.   It is essential that compatibility be maintained in the VistA Storage system in both operational management and the ability to program and manipulate the SAN with skills already in the field.No other vendor product would be acceptable to continue the present platform infrastructure, and provide the compatibility in both storage units and the skills required for its operation.  The use of fiber channel HBAs (host bus adaptors) compatible of the current computers will allow access from VistA computers to the new SAN with little or no change to the VA code base.   Only one source is capable of responding to this for compatibility of the firmware, in device cache, OS drivers, and file access, with known reliable results for Cache (the Mumps database).  The EVA provides a unique storage environment for the VistA system. The EVA system has unique firmware that control the interaction between the CAN (cabinet area network) and the SAN management appliance.  The interaction of the controller and the OS drivers is critical and compatibility across the CPUs and older EVAs is essential.  Changes to any of this infrastructure can cause code malfunctions that could endanger the lives of the VA patients. 3)Tape Backup LibraryNeed to procure an MSL 6030 tape library device.   This device is one of a family of tape drives provided by Hewlett Packard and is used to backup and restore vital patient data for VistA.  Current VistA backup procedures use DCL (Digital Command Language) in VMS to perform the backups.  Since backups are critical to patient care and there needs to compatibility to existing tapes and data sets it is important that the systems be identical.  The HP StorageWorks MSL6000 Tape Libraries provide centralized backup in a single automated device.  This tape library device is necessary to perform backups of data from the SAN.  It can backup both logical and image data.   These libraries are for medium to large IT networks, with a storage area network (SAN). The MSL6000 Tape Libraries offer best-in-class tape technology including the HP StorageWorks Ultrium 960, SDLT600 and Ultrium 460 tape drives. This portfolio of tape libraries offers a scalable, flexible, and manageable centralized tape backup solution that can grow with ever-changing backup and recovery needs, while reducing IT staff involvement. The MSL6000 Tape Libraries will scale to larger configurations by enabling a single library to grow and change with capacity and technology as needs require. Ultrium 960, SDLT600 and Ultrium 460 tape drives are available as upgrades to currently installed MSL5000 and MSL6000 Tape Libraries. With the MSL controller-based architecture, a direct-attach configuration can easily move to a SAN-based storage environment with only an interface card upgrade.  This interface is necessary to maintain compatibility with other libraries and tapes from other VistA installations.   With the same tape units and compatibility with the tape cartridges as well as the tape format and Operating system drivers, this unit will work without issue backup and recovery.   The MSL6000 Tape Libraries are easily managed through an intuitive GUI-control panel and integrated remote web management, allowing simple management capabilities from any remote or on-site location.   This library system is compatible with the VMS operating system and has custom drivers necessary for its operation.  VA staff has written many DCL (Batch  Digital Command Language) executable procedures that are dependent on this tape unit.Because of the complex nature of this system and all the subcomponents that comprise it, buying this as a turnkey system places the responsibility on the vendor HP to deliver the total system as one working unit.  This system will include all software, hardware, power and cabling requirements.  As defined in the equipment list that is attached, all items are manufacturer specific because the lab must duplicate the actual operational environment.  3.  Description of Supplies:  There are few supplies necessary for the system, but tapes will be required for the tape library.  These are already in use at all VAs.   Maintaining the compatibility of the tape media was an important driving factor in procurement of this system.4.  Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition:  This acquisition is conducted under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(c), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  This is not a sole source justification; rather it is a justification to permit other than full and open competition due to a brand-name requirement.  5.  Nature of the Acquisition:  As described in paragraph 2 above, the Innovation and Engineering Lab must precisely model the medical center infrastructure in order to provide a test bed to test applications prior to implementation in the production environment.  Since the lab and network are already in place, the equipment for the lab must be exactly the same as the current VistA systems, therefore, this acquisition requires specific brand names and models.  6.  Sources Solicited:This acquisition will be solicited under the NASA Scientific Engineering, Workstation Procurement (SEWP), to all SEWP contract holders (this includes multiple small, veteran owned, woman owned and 8(a) businesses.7.  Fair and Reasonable Price:Pricing shall be determined fair and reasonable based on competitive quotes, as authorized in FAR 13.106-3(a)(1).  8.  Market Research Conducted:No additional market research was conducted, this will be offered to all NASA SEWP contract holders.9.  Other Facts:N/A.10.  Sources Interested:No sources have expressed an interest.11.  Overcoming Barriers:No actions to remove or overcome any barriers is anticipated. Due to the nature of the requirement, as explained above, VA has to solicit for only the specific brand names/models already in place in the VA Computing Infrastructure.12.  Certification:I hereby certify that the justification for other than full and open competition is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.Approvals:The proposed contract is less than $1,000,000, which requires approval from the contracting officer.  ____________________________ 			________________Contracting Officer					DateDepartment of Veterans AffairsAustin Automation Center (AAC)

<DESC><p>The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) MILSATCOM Systems Wing (MCSW) and Protected SATCOM Group intends to modify the existing CASIES contract, FA8808-06-C-0002, to increase the level of effort by approximately 18,000 hours for Option Year 2, by 29,000 hours for Option Year 3 and by 37,000 hours for Option Year 4 for the MILSATCOM Protected Group (AEHF program). In addition, 28,000 hours will be added for Option Year 3 and 4 to support MILSATCOM Systems Wing Engineering, under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1(a)(2).
<p>The modification for increased CASIES support will be issued to the incumbent contractor, Linquest Corporation, 5140 Goldleaf Circle, Los Angeles CA, 90056-1299.</p>
<p>This action modifies an existing contract to increase the authorized level of support to the Protected SATCOM Group (MCPG) to accommodate an extension of activities due to over two years of launch slip impacts in the AEHF program. The original contract envisioned a ramp-down of required System Engineering and Integration (SE&amp;I) on AEHF following first launch, scheduled at the time for April 2008. Since then, delays on the AEHF development contract have pushed launch out by over two years. As a result, the planned ramp-down of SE&amp;I requirements is premature, so it is necessary to increase the CASIES effort to support continuing AEHF development and integration. This modification does not add new requirements to, nor extend the period of performance of, the CASIES contract.</p>
<p>The MILSATCOM Systems Wing issued a Sources Sought Synopsis on 15 April 2005 to solicit input from industry and examined the acquisition history of this type of support to AEHF program. The program office maintains cognizance over the protected SATCOM market and has seen no other companies emerge with the capability to meet these requirements without incurring a significant duplication of costs and unacceptable schedule impact to the program.</p>
<p>The information contained herein is based on the best information available at the time of publication, is subject to revision, and is not binding on the Government. This notice is for information purposes only and the Government will not recognize any cost associated with submission of information in response to this or previous notices.</p>

<DESC><p>The Bureau of Public Debt, on behalf of the U.S. Access Board intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with the Acoustical Society of America of 35 Pinelawn Road, Suite 114E, Melville, NY 11747, the review, revision, and balloting of ANSI/ASA S12.60-2002 Standard on Classroom Acoustics.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1998, in response to a petition from the mother of a youngster who has a hearing impairment, the US Access Board helped fund the development of ANSI/ASA S12.60-2002, a voluntary standard for the accessibility of classroom listening condition. This standard is accredited by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI); the Acoustical Society of America (ASA) is the secretariat for the standard. ASA's Committee S12 on Noise developed the standard. This standard is accredited by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI); the Acoustical Society of America (ASA) is the Secretariat for the standard. The Board now has the opportunity to propose that standard for reference in the 2012 edition of the International Building Code (IBC), which will insure local enforcement of the standard in states that use the IBC. In order for the standard to be referenced, ANSI rules require it to have a certain format; this will require small changes to its current wording and the completion of a fast-tracked standards revision process so that the completed standard can be published by May 1, 2010 to meet IBC deadlines.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by July 17, 2009 by 10:00am ET. Responses shall be submitted to PSB3@bpd.treas.gov.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC><p>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION OR A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP). IT IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO ISSUE A SOLICITATION OR ULTIMATELY AWARD A CONTRACT. ANY COST INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT SHALL BE BORNE BY THE INTERESTED PARTY (PROSPECTIVE OFFEROR) AND WILL NOT BE CHARGED TO THE GOVERNMENT FOR REIMBURSEMENT.<br />Preterm delivery is a complex disorder caused by multiple genetic and environmental factors, which most likely interact to determine risk. Despite the general acceptance of the importance of gene-environment interactions on the risk of preterm birth, there have very few published studies that have examined the joint impact of environmental and genetic factors on the risk for preterm birth and there have been no studies examining the joint impact of any environmental and genetic factors on very preterm birth.
<p>The Division of Reproductive Health, Maternal and Infant Health Branch at CDC has been collaborating with the California Department of Public Health, Genetic Disease Screening Program (Contract #200-2008-M-26279; Procurement #00HCUCJB-2008-55408) to conduct a study to improve our understanding of gene-environment interactions that contribute to risk of very preterm birth and that underlie racial disparities in maternal and infant health. This population-based case-control study will examine the maternal and infant genetic contributions to preterm birth. Biological specimens from mother-infant pairs who participated in the California prenatal and newborn screening programs between November 1999 and April 2007 were included in this study. Samples were sent to Utah State University to conduct DNA extraction and amplification (PO #00HCUCJB-2008-55408) and then to Sequenom, Inc. for genotyping of up to 1500 polymorphisms in more than 90 candidate genes in three overlapping biological pathways (PO #00HCUCJB-2008-55408).</p>
<p>Results from this study will allow a comparative assessment of the contribution of both maternal and fetal genotypes in a single study and will also assess potential maternal and/or infant gene-gene interactions (maternal-maternal, infant-infant, maternal-infant) and potential maternal and/or infant gene-environment interactions that modify the risk of preterm birth.</p>
<p>The CDC intends to issue a contract to genotype approximately 128 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that failed using the Sequenom platform. The vendor shall use the OpenArray instrument by BioTrove Inc., to conduct this analysis on the 4,000 newborn blood samples and maternal blood clots after whole genome amplification. This additional SNP information will fill-in linkage disequilibrium blocks left empty by the Sequenom analysis. The vendor shall provide all labor, materials, and equipment required to complete the tasks outlined below. The vendor may require communications with CDC to obtain guidance on the shipping and processing of specimens to be sent to the collaborating laboratories. The vendor shall perform the following tasks: (1) Use whole genome amplified DNA from approximately 4000 samples extracted newborn blood spots and genomic DNA extracted from maternal blood clots to conduct the genotyping; (2) Genotype approximately 128 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) provided by the California Preterm Workgroup that failed using the Sequenom platform; (3) Use the BioTrove or similar system to conduct the analysis and (4) Send genotyping results to CDC. This award will be made pursuant to FAR 6.302(a)(2), "when the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, or, for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, from only one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for."

<DESC><p>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION OR A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP). IT IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO ISSUE A SOLICITATION OR ULTIMATELY AWARD A CONTRACT. ANY COST INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT SHALL BE BORNE BY THE INTERESTED PARTY (PROSPECTIVE OFFEROR) AND WILL NOT BE CHARGED TO THE GOVERNMENT FOR REIMBURSEMENT.<br />The Maternal and Infant Health Assessment (MIHA) is a collaborative effort of the California Department of Public Health's (CDPH)'s Maternal, Child, and Adolescent Health Program (MCAH) and University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) researchers. MIHA is an annual survey of California women who recently gave birth to a live infant. Since 1999, MIHA has annually surveyed approximately 3,500 women giving birth in California during February through May, with response rates of 70% or higher; African American women are oversampled. Women in the weighted MIHA samples appear similar to all eligible California mothers delivering during the survey period. The MIHA survey is modeled on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) survey. PRAMS is an ongoing, population-based survey among women who recently delivered a live-born infant. PRAMS surveys are currently administered by 37 states, New York City, and one tribal-state partnership in South Dakota. Each state surveys 1,200-3,600 women annually at approximately 2-6 months after delivery. Both MIHA and PRAMS draw stratified random samples from statewide birth certificates, use mail questionnaires with telephone follow-up to non-responders, and apply state-specific statistical weights to account for sampling design (including non-coverage, for PRAMS) and non-response. Both systems collect a wide range of information about maternal health status, health behavior, knowledge, and experiences before, during and shortly after pregnancy. This data can be used to identify groups of women and infants at high risk for health problems, monitor changes in health status, and measure progress toward goals to improve the health of mothers and infants.
<p>The value of PRAMS and MIHA to date has been limited by the absence of national estimates. . Even when conducting analyses of multi-state data, the results are not weighted to be national estimates, only the distribution of each state's individual estimates. Analytic challenges exist in producing national estimates from existing data since there are large differences in some PRAMS-measured behaviors between existing PRAMS states and compared to California;. In addition no data exists on how alike or unlike states not participating in these surveys are compared to participating states. The most feasible way to determine national or "near national" estimates it to develop joint estimates of key MCH indicators using PRAMS and MIHA data. Doing so would allow calculation of estimates representing 87% of U.S. births. These indicators can be used to inform maternal and child health programs and policies at the national level.</p>
<p>Thus, three important activities shall be required: (1) Provide expert guidance and technical oversight to the identification of key MCH indicators from MIHA that would be suitable for generating near national estimates to assess national recommendations, treatment guidelines, or other national policy or interventions; (2) Collaborate on determining proper methods and analysis of selected indicators; (3) Contribute to three Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports (MMWR) on selected indicators.</p>
<p>The vendor shall provide all labor, materials, and equipment required to complete the tasks outlined below. The vendor shall be required to work in collaboration with the CDC and partners and to complete the desired tasks. CDC PRAMS staff will assist with the data management of the pooled PRAMS sample and create variables needed for analysis. CDC will provide the vendor with a data set containing data from all participating states and the variables needed for analysis.</p>
<p>The vendor shall perform the following tasks: (1) Participate in kick-off meeting via conference call with CDC PRAMS staff and California Department of Public Health (CDPH) Maternal, Child, and Adolescent Health (MCAH) staff to discuss the scope of work, frequency and method of communication, roles and responsibilities, etc.; (2) Collaborate with CDC PRAMS staff on all aspects of the project; (3) Examine the literature and MIHA survey questions to identify those that are most comparable to the PRAMS survey questions, could provide data to generate national estimates for maternal and child health indicators, and could be used to assess national recommendations, treatment guidelines, or other national policy or interventions; (4) In collaboration with CDPH MCAH and CDC PRAMS staff select 3 key indicators, study design and analysis; (5) Travel to Atlanta with one collaborator from CDPH MCAH to meet with CDC PRAMS staff to provide expert consultation on the best way to analyze, code, present survey data to ensure data generated are most comparable, and jointly plan the proposed reports; (6) Use SAS/SUDAAN statistical programming to calculate the prevalence of MIHA indicator #1 by selected socio-demographic factors; summarize these results in tables; (7) In collaboration with staff at CDC PRAMS project and CDPH MCAH staff generate estimates of PRAMS indicator #1 by selected socio-demographic factors, review preliminary findings and determine next course of action (i.e. run additional analyses, proceed with reporting findings, etc.); (8) In collaboration with CDC PRAMS staff and CDPH MCAH staff produce a final MMWR summarizing all findings and recommendations based on the results for indicator #1; includes preparing draft, submitting to clearance, responding to reviewer comments, etc.; (9) Use SAS/SUDAAN statistical programming to calculate the prevalence of MIHA indicator #2 by selected socio-demographic factors; summarize these results in tables; (10) In collaboration with CDC PRAMS staff and CDPH MCAH staff generate estimates of PRAMS indicator #2 by selected socio-demographic factors, review preliminary findings and determine next course of action (i.e. run additional analyses, proceed with reporting findings, etc.); (11) In collaboration with CDC PRAMS staff and CDPH MCAH staff produce a final MMWR summarizing all findings and recommendations based on the results for indicator #2; includes preparing draft, submitting to clearance, responding to reviewer comments, etc.; (12) Use SAS/SUDAAN statistical programming to calculate the prevalence of MIHA indicator #3 by selected socio-demographic factors; summarize these results in tables; (13) In collaboration with CDC PRAMS staff and CDPH MCAH staff generate estimates of PRAMS indicator #3 by selected socio-demographic factors, review preliminary findings and determine next course of action (i.e. run additional analyses, proceed with reporting findings, etc.); (14) In collaboration with CDC PRAMS staff and CDPH MCAH staff to produce a final MMWR summarizing all findings and recommendations based on the results for indicator #3. This award will be made pursuant to FAR 6.302(a)(2), "when the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, or, for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, from only one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for."

<DESC>Under authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c ) (1), the VA Medical Center, Dayton OH intends to issue a sole source award to Scriptpro USA Inc. to provide a Scriptpro SP 100 Robotic Proscription Dispensing System with Collating Control Center.  The contractor shall furnish all supplies, materials, and labor necessary to deliver the system and install it at the Dayton VA Medical Center's Clinical Based Outpatient Care Facility (CBOC) located in Springfield at 512 South Burnett Road, Springfield, OH 45505. A 12-month support service to maintain the system will also be required.  The price provided shall be inclusive of all delivery and installation charges.  The estimated amount of this award is $259,321.00.The Government has a need to maintain continuity and consistency in equipment and training between the various locations throughout VISN 10 in the State of Ohio.  It is anticipated that procurement of a separate system would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the government that is highly unlikely to be recoverable through competition.  Previous VA procurements have utilized this specific type of equipment, for which, there is only one known manufacturer and provider. As such the government plans to solicit and make an award for this requirement to only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1). This is not a request for competitive proposals.  Solicitation packages are not available.  Responses received in relation to this notice will be reviewed; however, ultimate determination regarding the removal of the sole source for this requirement rests with the contracting officer. Information regarding this notice maybe requested from the Contracting Officer, Alex Daniel, in writing to the VA Medical Center, VISN 10 Contracting Office (NBC), Attn: Alex Daniel, 4100 West Third Street, Dayton, OH 45428.

Based on extensive market research conducted with knowledgeable individuals in Government and the related industry, only one responsible source can provide the requested equipment because Waters Corporation is the sole source manufacturer and distributor of Waters' 2465 Electrochemical Detector and only a Waters instrument is compatible with another Waters instrument.
<p>This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested parties may identify their interests and capability to respond to this requirement or submit quotes to this office by 10:00 AM, EST, Wednesday, July 15, 2009 by e-mail to Dina.Olibah@ic.fbi.gov.

<DESC><p>This is a Research and Development (R &amp; D) Sources Sought notice.
<p>This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential R &amp; D requirement.</p>
<p>a. Background.</p>
<p>The Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with PPD Development, Inc. under Contract # N01-AI-30068, to continue performing Clinical Trials Management support specifically, as described below and in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.</p>
<p>Under the current contract, PPD is providing support in the following areas: Clinical Site assessment, Site Monitoring, Study document preparation, pharmacovigilance, essential document collection, Good Clinical Practices (GCP) training, assistance to DMIS clinical sites in the establishment and/or enhancement of Internal Quality Control/Quality Assurance (QC/QA) programs, clinical trial tracking data management and web-based information dissemination.</p>
<p>The DMID 03-154 study started in May 2005, and was completed in April 2008. The study was open during the period of time that requires reporting the results in the National Library of Medicine (NLM) ClinicalTrials.gov Protocol Registration System (PRS) for public view, as required by new federal regulations. This acquisition is to provide statistical and clinical data management support for the study results that will be reported in the ClinicalTrials.gov PRS. The reporting of the results is on a twelve-month extension and must be completed by April 1, 2010. The data are in DMID's custody; however the data are in raw database format without analyses. Therefore, the scope of this acquisition is to convert and analyze the data in the format required to be compliant with the ClinicalTrials.gov PRS.</p>
<p>b. Project requirements.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that this is a onetime action. The scope of the current project is to analyze the 03-154 raw data, and in compliance with the U.S. Public Law 110-85, format the data for reporting the results to the NLM ClinicalTrials.gov PRS website.</p>
<p>The expectations of the contract-awardee are: <br />1. Review and analyze the 03-154 raw clinical data and available published reports<br />2. Format the data and analysis per NLM ClinicalTrials.gov PRS requirements.<br />3. Submit data tables and summaries to DMID for review and comment, <br />4. Submit the data tables and summaries to the PPD CTM Data group according to the most current process, <br />5. Resolve any subsequent queries from the NLM ClinicalTrials.gov.</p>
<p>c. Anticipated period of performance. <br />The estimated start date is August 15, 2009. The estimated date of completion is November 15, 2009.</p>
<p>d. Other important considerations.</p>
<p>This scope of work required that PPD provide de novo infrastructure development to support DMID's clinical research. To this end, PPD has assembled a well-trained staff of database programmers, web-designers, medical writers, clinical site monitors and other staff to support the diverse management needs. Of great significance is the cadre of database and systems programmers who have set up a tracking system for DMID's clinical protocols which allows for easy transfer of information to the National Library of Medicine's clinicaltrials.gov website. In the last year, the web designers have established a hub of resources utilized by over 450 password protected users worldwide. This customized database is critical to DMID's ability to track the status of over 400 protocols worldwide and the data transfer of over 125 protocols to the National Library of Medicine's ClinicalTrials.gov registry. Access to study related documents is granted to users on a role-restricted basis. PPD has also provided medical writers who are well versed in the various DMID protocol templates, and trained in writing, editing or reviewing protocols for DMID.</p>
<p>DMID has determined PPD is the only responsible source to provide the complex and integrated support services to meet DMID clinical research demands at this time. If the clinical trials management support contract, or any significant component thereof, were awarded to another contractor at this time, it would result in substantial duplication of costs to the Government (see below) that are not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements on account of the interruption of numerous projects and inconsistency in oversight of the clinical research work conducted by DMID.</p>
<p><br />e. Capability statement /information sought.</p>
<p>Therefore, no other service will satisfy DMID's requirements. If there are responsible sources who feel that they are able to perform the requirement, they must respond by submitting a capabilities statement that clearly demonstrate their ability to assume the work without necessary delay and duplication of cost and effort.</p>
<p>Disclaimer and Important Notes. This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the organization's qualifications to perform the work. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted. After a review of the responses received, a pre-solicitation synopsis and solicitation may be published in Federal Business Opportunities. However, responses to this notice will not be considered adequate responses to a solicitation.</p>
<p>Confidentiality. No proprietary, classified, confidential, or sensitive information should be included in your response. The Government reserves the right to use any non-proprietary technical information in any resultant solicitation(s).</p>

<SOLNBR>EP-C-08-015-Modification21
<ARCHDATE>09072009
<CONTACT>David A Plagge, Contracting Officer, Phone (513) 487-2022, Fax (513) 487-2107, Email plagge.david@epa.gov
<DESC><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY</strong><br /></span>The purpose of this Modification 21 is to obligate $409,000 in initial funding in support of Work Assignments (WA 1-102 and WA 1-103). The period of performance for Work Assignment 1-102 will be from June 11, 2009 though December 31, 2009. The period of performance for Work Assignment 1-103 will be from June 15, 2009 though December 31, 2009.
<p>Under Work Assignment 1-102 the contractor is to provide support for the review of Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) project proposals received by the individual State for ARRA funding, determine whether or not those projects have a green component, and make recommendations for green practices (e.g., more efficient pumps, water conservation devices) that can be incorporated into the projects. A secondary purpose is to provide technical assistance to states in reviewing the "business cases" that are submitted along with projects in support of considering them as green projects. The work assignment will also advance the goal of encouraging the development and implementation of projects that provide the social, health and environmental benefits to be derived from "environmentally green" projects under the green project reserve of the ARRA.</p>
<p>Under Work Assignment 1-103 the contractor shall provide expertise and support to assist EPA's effort to assure an effective, legal and appropriate expenditure of ARRA funds to achieve the objectives of the economic stimulus through significant program implementation and oversight. Support tasks include assisting in: reviewing EPA Regional ARRA implementation efforts including oversight of State ARRA programs; developing fact sheets and questions and answers (Q&amp;As) on key ARRA aspects and issues such as flexibility in set asides and needed testing of financial tracking approaches; and providing training to EPA Regional and State drinking water staffs on the latest Agency ARRA policies.</p>
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Water (OW) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OW contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OW contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

<DESC>Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, the U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering (RDEC) Acquisition Center, Natick Contracting Division (NDC), Kansas Street, Natick, MA on behalf of the U. S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center,, Natick, MA intends to negotiate and award a Contract on a sole source basis with Wilcox Industries Corp, 25 Piscataqua Drive, Newington, NH 03801 for 250 NVG Head Mounts that allow the use of night vision goggles without a helmet. The proposed contractor, Wilcox Industries, is currently the only manufacturer of the NVG Head Mounting System that is compatible with the operators current night vision goggles and L2 Series NVG mounts and accessories.  This system is unique in that it provides two modes of operation.  The first mode allows the Universal NVG Mount to break away from the base under a stressed condition, such as when prompted by interference during fast roping, maritime operations, hard impact or when entering or exiting mobility platforms. Without the Wilcox breakaway feature, the potential to induce neck injury is increased. The second mode allows the Universal NVG Mount to securely lock the mount to the base. Any firm that believes it can meet this requirement may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 5 days from the date of publication of this announcement.  Supporting evidence must be in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirements, yet must be limited to 2 pages.  Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government to compete the proposed procurement based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received, NCD will proceed with awarding a firm fixed price purchase order to Wilcox Industries.  Nothing herein should be misconstrued as a request for proposal.  No solicitation document is available.  Any Questions concerning this acquisition may be addressed to the above address, Attention: Mr. Nate Jordan or by email to: Nathan.C.Jordan@us.army.mil.

<DESC>Research is being conducted between the Engineering Research and Development Center (ERDC) and the US Air Force Air Combat Command as part of the Critical Runway Assessment and Repair (CRATR) Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD). Under this demonstration, the ERDC is assisting in performing three key activities to demonstrate, improve upon, and ultimately field various solutions for rapid airfield damage repair (ADR). The research performed under the Small and Large Crater and the Advanced Airfield Damage repair projects at the ERDC (2006 and 2007) demonstrated that Rapid Set Concrete Mix offered the best alternative capping small and large crater repairs when compared to other rapid-setting concrete materials. Rapid Set Concrete Mix was the only material investigated that meets all specifications for laboratory experiments. Field mixing specifications required that the material be a rapid-setting concrete mix that only required the addition of water without additional aggregates to produce the product. Testing period will be conducted at Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida beginning July 2009. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. No RFP will be issued based upon this Notice of Intent. Interested parties may submit any information for consideration by the Government to Markeda.L.Mims@usace.amry.mil with solicitation number referenced in the subject line. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:00 CST on 10 July 2009.

<p>Response Date: 22 July 2009</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES 13.5.</p>
<p>This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-33.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541690 for a 100% small business set-aside.</p>
<p>The FDA intends to issue a firm fixed-price purchase order for the following technical assistance.</p>
<p>I. Background<br />Food and Drug Administration's Pharmaceutical Quality Initiative for the 21st Century was introduced in 2002 to enhance and modernize the regulation of pharmaceutical manufacturing and product quality - to bring a 21st century focus to this critical FDA responsibility. The initiative is intended to modernize FDA's regulation of pharmaceutical quality for veterinary and human drugs and select human biological products (e.g., vaccines). Two of the main tenets of the initiative were to ensure that regulatory review, compliance, and inspection policies are based on state-of-the-art pharmaceutical science and to enhance the consistency and coordination of the overall FDA drug quality regulatory programs.<br />As a result of the diligent work done under the Quality Initiative, the FDA has completed its assessment of the existing quality programs. We assessed current practices as well as available new tools of enhancing manufacturing science. Our assessment helped us create a new framework for the regulatory oversight of manufacturing quality that is based on quality systems and risk management approaches. Our findings have put the Agency on a path to restructure its oversight of pharmaceutical quality regulation, thereby developing the product quality regulatory system of the future.</p>
<p>The three parts of the drug quality regulatory programs - review, compliance, and inspection have basically worked independent of each other over the years. However, in order to successfully implement all of the tenets of the Quality Initiative, it is necessary to develop more coordinated interactions between the three areas. In order to do this, the roles and responsibilities of each separate section must be defined and more specific processes must be implemented, most specifically to enhance communication between the sections.<br />Recently an evaluation was performed to determine roles and responsibilities of review, compliance, and inspection under the new regulatory paradigm and to recommend appropriate processes to ensure effective interaction and communication. That recent assessment of the product quality review process among the relevant FDA business units found a lack of clear roles and responsibilities and lack of clear and cohesive process steps for ensuring product quality.</p>
<p>The work conducted under this contract will be a continuation of the previous assessment task and will focus on following up on the recommendations to develop a seamless process between the various business units involved in product quality review, compliance, and inspections with a focus on documenting roles and responsibilities at each stage of the process.</p>
<p>II. Purpose and Objective<br />The purpose of this effort will be to develop a quality management system for drug product quality review and will involve:</p>
<p>1) Characterizing the Desired State for Review, Compliance &amp; Inspection in the 21st century<br />2) Developing Multiple Examples (at least 3) to Clarify Desired State Relative to Current State<br />3) Assessing Capabilities &amp; Skills of Existing Staff and Identify Opportunities for Development<br />4) Providing SME Consulting to FDA Leadership to Enable Desired State<br />5) Providing On-Going Monitoring Support to Process Consulting and SOP Development Effort<br />During Course of Pilot</p>
<p>III. Description of Deliverables<br />The deliverables for this project include:<br />1) Documenting a characterization of the desired state for the FDA's product quality review business process;<br />2) Assessing the capabilities and skill sets of the existing staff who conduct compliance reviews;<br />3) Developing example scenarios to be used during a pilot to test the new standard operating procedures; and<br />4) Providing subject matter expertise and ongoing consulting support.</p>

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for a Three-wavelength Integrating Nephelometer which is needed for the study of aerosol scattering in a closed chamber.  The instrument shall measure total integrated scattering coefficients and integrated backscatter coefficients of an aerosol flowing through a sample chamber.   All equipment must be new. Refurbished and or remanufactured shall not be considered. 

All interested Contractors shall provide a quote for the following line item:

Line Item 0001: Quantity One (1) each, Three-wavelength Integrating Nephelometer which shall meet or exceed the following required minimum specifications:
(1) Simultaneous detection of three wavelengths over the visible spectral range with wavelengths centered in the following ranges: red (650700) nm, green (500-550 nm), and blue (420-470) nm;
(2) Minimum sensitivity 0.3 Mm1 or better in a 60 s average, Maximum sensitivity: 2000 Mm1 or greater;
(3) Scattering angles measured must cover the range 7170 (angles are measured relative to direction of incident light);
(4) A backscatter shutter must be provided so that measured scattering angles lie between 90 and the maximum scattering angle (minimum 170).  This shall be programmable and controlled in the front panel, as stated below;
(5) A minimum flow rate no greater than 7 standard L/min with heating within the sampling chamber not to exceed 0.5C at this flow rate for 1.013 bar air;
(6) Must support programmable computer interface, either through USB or RS-232 serial connections.  Documentation of control commands shall be included;
(7) Must include on-board display and control panel;

Warranty:
The vendor shall provide a minimum warranty period of one year from date of receipt and acceptance by the Government. Contractor shall state the warranty coverage for the equipment.  

Delivery shall be not later than 90 days from receipt of an order.
Delivery terms shall be FOB Destination. FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery. The contractor shall deliver all line items to NIST, Building 301, Gaithersburg, MD 20899. 

Evaluation Criteria :  
Award shall be made to the Contractor whose quote offers the best value to the Government. The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability factor Meeting or Exceeding the Requirement, 2) Past Performance, and 3) Price. 

Technical capability and past performance shall be more important than price. Of the non-price factors, technical capability shall be the most important.
Technical Capability:

Technical capability shall be evaluated to determine the Contractors ability to successfully complete the requirements as stated herein. Product literature shall be evaluated to determine that the proposed equipment will meet or exceed all of the Governments required minimum specifications as reflected herein. 

In evaluating technical capability, strongest consideration shall be given to equipment that exceeds the following minimum specifications:  
1. Minimum sensitivity 0.3 Mm1 or better in a 60 s average, Maximum
sensitivity: 2000 Mm1 or greater, stronger consideration shall be given to a lower minimum sensitivity;

2. Scattering angles measured must cover the range 7170 (angles are measured relative to direction of incident light), stronger consideration shall be given to larger range of scattering angles;

3. A minimum flow rate no greater than 7 standard L/min with heating within the sampling chamber not to exceed 0.5C at this flow rate for 1.013 bar air; stronger consideration shall be given to less heating (a lower temperature differential) in the sample chamber;

4. Entire measurement system shall be contained within a single case not to exceed 350 mm x 1200 mm x 350 mm with the exception that an external power supply may be utilized.  The unit shall be able to sit on a bench top for operation, stronger consideration shall be given to smaller systems; additional consideration shall be given to systems designed with the long axis lying horizontal, which includes proper orientation of control electronics on front panel.

Past Performance will be evaluated to determine the overall quality of the product & services provided and the Contractors history of successfully meeting delivery schedules. Evaluation of Past Performance shall be based on the references provided and/or the quoters recent and relevant procurement history with NIST or its affiliates.

3.   The camera must be retractable in order to be compatible with a post-column energy-filter.

Gatan is the only known company offering a retractable, bottom mount CCD camera.
       
The brand name sole source determination is based on the need of an upgraded camera system in order to continue to conduct experiments within the Laboratory of Structural Biology Research has specialized in detailed structural analysis of macromolecules, macromolecular complexes, and subcellular structures by computer-enhanced electron microscopy. The goal of these studies is to elucidate structure-function relationships at the molecular level with particular emphasis on (but not restricted to) systems that bear directly on the mission of NIAMS.  

Background. 

This program was initiated in 1978 with the appointment of a tenure-track investigator (the Project Officer), and progressed to become a Section in 1984, and further to Laboratory status in 1990. A typical research project involves recording electron micrographs of the highest possible quality, subjecting them to digital image analysis to elicit the maximum amount of structural information, and interpretation, taking into account all pertinent complementary data. Over the years, the LSBR has performed ground-breaking studies on cytoskeletal filaments, virus particles and antigens, and complex enzymes among other important biomedical specimens. The results achieved depend both on the quality of the primary data (electron microscope images) and the scope of computer analysis. Cryo-electron microscopy  the technique of visualizing organic specimens suspended in vitreous ice - was introduced in the 1980s and has revolutionized what is achievable. The LSBR has been to the fore in these advances and in 1997 accomplished the landmark result of extending the resolution on isolated complexes below the 10 limit for the first time. In order to maintain the LSBR program at the cutting-edge of this research field, it is necessary to periodically upgrade the hardware used in the lab.

Specifically, the LSBR is in need of a 4k x 4k CCD camera to capture digital electron micrographs. With the advent of this size CCD sensor and its associated larger field of view, the prospect of recording high-resolution electron micrographs digitally rather than on traditional film is becoming a reality.  The lab will benefit from a reduced need for silver-based photochemistry and a decreased dependence on EM film, which has become pricier and harder to obtain in recent years.  Since the images recorded on such a device would be in a digital format, the time-consuming step of digitalizing (scanning) electron micrographs, as is currently done with traditional film, would be eliminated.  The larger field of view, which is superior to any of our current CCD cameras, and the fact that the images are digital also makes it feasible to implement automated collection of electron micrographs for high-resolution studies with the use of programs such as Leginon, a software package that is available from The Scripps Institute.  

 The offer must include complete copies of the following provisions: 1) FAR Clause 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors Commercial: 2) FAR Clause 52.212-2, Evaluation Commercial Items. As stated in FAR Clause 52.212- (a), The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation, and will be most advantageous to the Government, with price and other factors considered.

____________.<br />Requirements:<br />1.0 Statement of Work. <br />1.1 Task: Development for FSW Product<br />Satellite-derived flood maps in near-real time are valuable information to stake holders and policy makers for disaster monitoring and relief efforts. In the mission of GOES-R satellite development, FSW is one of the requirements desired (option 2) products by the program office and the user community. The GOES-R Algorithm Working Group (AWG) land team takes the responsibility of developing algorithms for the land surface products including FSW. This task will be part of the land team activities conducting for final deliveries of the algorithm code, related scientific and programming documents. The development is based on the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) instrument that will be on board the GOES-R satellite, and will need to meet the requirements defined particularly for the FSW product by the GOES Program Office (GPO). <br />A detection algorithm will be developed for producing the GOES-R FSW product. Major tasks for the development include: <br />1) An algorithm design review (ADR) will be conducted and reported to the GOES-R Algorithm Working Group (AWG).<br />2) A set of science code developed following the design will be delivered to the GOES-R AWG, with associated parameters, test dataset, and test results. A document of describing the software will be included software code and related documents will be delivered to the AWG. The code will meet the AWG requirement.<br />3) A critical design review of the algorithm development will be conducted and reported to the AWG. <br />4) An 80% readiness Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) will be delivered. The ATBD will meet the content and format requirements defined by the AWG. It will be examined by independent reviewers selected by the GOES-R program office. <br />5) The task activities will be scheduled and reported monthly for progress, issue and resolution.</p>
<p>1.2 Task: Development for LST Product<br />Land surface temperature (LST) is important for understanding climate change, modeling the hydrological and biogeochemical cycles, and is a prime candidate parameter for Numerical Weather Prediction assimilation models. Current GOES LST at NOAA NESDIS is an intermediate product derived from sounder data which is poor in resolution and unknown accuracy. High resolution GOES LSTs with better accuracy are required from users, like the NCEP Weather forecast and data assimilation model (Ken Mitchell). In addition, the GOES LSTs derived from GOES-East and GOES-West may be mission goals in Climate, and Weather and water, a proposal for developing consistent LST from GOES satellites was submitted and approved by GOES Improved Measurements and Product Assurance Plan (GIMPAP). <br />A retrieval algorithm will be developed for producing the GOES LST product. Major tasks for the development include: <br />1) Multi-channel LST Algorithm(s) and coefficients will be developed/adapted and generated. The algorithms are applicable for the infrared bands of GOES Imagers including GOES-8, GOES-10, and GOES-11, GOES-12, GOES-13. <br />2) Emissivity variation of the land surface will be considered explicitly in the algorithm for accurate LST retrieval. <br />3) The derived LSTs from different GOES Imagers should be consistent. In other words, the LST difference between the Imagers should not have significant impact to users who used the LST for climate record analysis.<br />4) The algorithm(s) will be ready to transit to operational product development<br />5) Quarterly report will be required for the project activities.<br />6) Software code, test datasets (including simulation data, real satellite data) will be delivered with related documents.<br />7) A primary validation report will be documented.</p>
<p>2.0 Suggest Staffing</p>
<p>The level of effort required is 1.5 FTE for 12 months. Expertise in satellite land surface remote sensing researches, specifically in the FSW and LST algorithm developments, is desired.</p>
<p>3.0 Deliverables</p>

(c) Special rules.  The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC><p>Combined Synopsis/Solicitation Amendment #1<br />RFQ09-LDQ002359
<p>The purpose of this amendment is to 1) respond to questions received prior to the cutoff date listed in the notice; 2) supplement technical specifications to include changes, additions, and clarifications in response to the questions.</p>
<p>1. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</p>
<p>Q1) Is it possible to arrange an onsite visit to see the power and positioning requirements?</p>
<p>A1) The facility it not currently available for viewing as construction of the warehouse is still in process. Therefore, an onsite visit is not necessary at this time. Installation for items is tentatively scheduled for approximately the September 2009 time frame; however, the date is subject to move based upon construction completion. The vendor shall state in the quote expected lead time vendor needs for delivery and installation. Quote shall state vendor lead time required once the FBI has the warehouse completed and approval for installation is received. Addition has been incorporated in the supplemental technical specification within Section 2 of this amendment.</p>
<p>Q2) For breathing air compressor, is Carbon- Monoxide / moisture indicator an electronic indicator that will shut down compressor if CO/moisture levels exceed upper threshold limits, or is the desired indicator comprised of a sight glass with indicator elements.</p>
<p>A2) The Carbon-Monoxide/moisture indicator shall be an electronic indicator that will shut down the compressor if CO/moisture level exceeds upper threshold limits. Threshold Limits: CO cannot exceed 10 ppm by volume. As for moisture, there shall be no free liquid water. The maximum water content of the air coming from the compressor shall not exceed 25 mg per cubic meter. Addition and clarification has been incorporated in the supplemental technical specification within Section 2 of this amendment.</p>
<p>Q3) For Nitrox generator, is blend level 42% oxygen as stated in RFQ correct or should level be 40%?</p>
<p>A3) The blend level should be 40% oxygen. Change has been incorporated in the supplemental technical specification within Section 2 of this amendment.<br />.<br />Q4) There is no way to place all this equipment in a 4'x8' room, is there any alternative, possible splitting the system placing some components outside the room?</p>
<p>A4) Due to FBI space limitations, equipment shall fit in the designated 4'x8' room. The room has approximately ~12' ceiling height. The anticipated plans are for the compressor and fill station with integrated control panel to sit on the floor. The cascade bottles are to be affixed to the wall on a shelf above and to the left of the station. The Nitrox generator is also to be mounted on the wall directly above the fill station. Vendors should note that the cascade bottles and nitrox generator must be mounted to the wall at installation and the compressor and fill station must be on the ground. Clarification has been incorporated in the supplemental technical specification within Section 2 of this amendment.</p>
<p><br />Q5) What are the storage vessels, are they D.O.T. cylinders or ASME vessels?</p>
<p>A5) The FBI requires that the vendor provide D.O.T. cylinders for the storage vessels. Addition has been incorporated in the supplemental technical specification within Section 2 of this amendment.<br /><br />Q6) Are you asking for an auxiliary regulator in order to fill external of the fill station?</p>
<p>A6) The auxiliary regulator is to tie into a piping system which will deliver low pressure (150 psi maximum) service air to the balance of the dive area and a computer service area. The air will be utilized for routine cleaning and maintenance of dive and computer equipment. Clarification has been incorporated in the supplemental technical specification within Section 2 of this amendment.</p>
<p><br />END OF QUESTIONS</p>
<p><br />2. Changes/Additions/ Clarifications to Technical Specifications:</p>

<DESC>Response to Question & Answers (Q & A's) to Solicitation FDA-1056044

Title: Use of Social Media to Supplement and Evaluate Risk Communication Efforts with Respect to Food-borne Outbreak


1.	The RFP states, "The technical proposal shall not exceed 15 pages exclusive of resumes and information about previous projects."  Can the government please confirm that Relevant Experience and Past Performance are excluded from the page count, since they contain information about previous projects?

Answer: The government confirms that the page limit does NOT include relevant experience and past performance.

2.	The RFP requests that 1) ceiling hourly rates for all labor categories be provided and 2) a proposed price including base plus four option years.  Can the government please confirm that Task 1, Task 2, and Task 3 are to be completed in the base year and priced accordingly, and that the option years pricing should only include ceiling rates?

Answer: The government confirms that Task 1 and part of the consultation (Task 3) related to Task 1 are to be completed in the base year.  The government cannot predict the exact timing of the work specified in Task 2 but expect that two (2) outbreaks will happen within two (2) calendar years from the award of the contract.  For business proposal purposes, the government therefore suggests that offerors use the assumption that the first of the two (2) outbreaks will occur in the base year and the second of the two (2) outbreaks will occur in the first option year.  In other words, please assume that about half of the work specified in Task 2 (and association consultation, Task 3) is to be completed in the base year and the other half in the first option year.

3.	The RFP indicates that reports must contain "2. number of page views and unique visitors"?  Such information will be difficult to obtain unless the media site indicates such information. Is this truly a required part of a report?

Answer: The government agrees that it would be difficult to obtain such information unless a media site provides the information.  Therefore, the government has amended the requirements under Task 1.2, Items 1, 2, and 4 (see FedBizOpps.gov announcement).

4.	The RFP indicates that reports must contain "4. site profiles, in visitors/participants demographic characteristics such as gender, age."  Again, such information will be difficult to obtain unless the media site indicates such information. Is this truly a required part of a report?

Answer: Please see answer to Question 3 above.

5.	The RFP indicates that outbreaks will be covered over a 20-week period.  What is the expected level of effort for each position over this 20 week period?  

Answer: The 20-week period is the length of time during which the government anticipates to have need for social media information about an outbreak.  The expected level of effort during this period is the level of effort that an offeror anticipates to use to complete the work and deliverables as specified in the Solicitation.

6.	To monitor news, can AP and Reuters be used as representative of news stories?  Opinion and editorial pieces would be searched for separately.

Answer: As stated in the Solicitation, the purpose of the study is to monitor and analyze a representative sample of social media Web sites.

7.	Does the Simplified Acquisition threshold ($100K) apply to each year of the 5-year contract period?

Answer: [No.  It is based on the total aggregate amount of a contract.  In accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures(test program).

8.	How does the 2-year period of performance indicated for each of the future outbreaks relate to the 5-year overall period of performance?

Answer: The 2-year period, beginning from the award of the contract, mentioned in the Objectives section refers to the period of time for which the government anticipates need for monitoring and analyzing two (2) future outbreaks.  Please also see answer to Question 1 above.

9.	For Task 1.2 - Will the FDA provide access to web log data for the outbreak periods (both past and future?) for FDA blogs, wesbsites, and social networking profiles? Contractor will need this information to discover things like number of page views, unique visitors, find incoming linked profiles, blog reactions, etc

Answer: No.  The government will not provide the information in question.  As a result, however, the government has amended the requirements under Task 1.2, Items 1, 2, and 4 (see FedBizOpps.gov announcement).

10.	Will the contractor be allowed to access FDA accounts on Facebook or MySpace, Twitter? 
o   Example: For the FDA Recalls Twitter user, will contractor have access private messages, hash tags, and re-tweets for http://twitter.com/FDArecalls?
o   Example 2: In order to access demographic information as required in Task 1.2, item 4  contractor will need access to the FDA Facebook profile.  Only limited information is available without being a friend with a user on Facebook.  

Answer: No.  Please see answer to Question 10 above.

11.	When do you anticipate the release of Questions and Answers?

	Answer: Please see answer to Question 9 above.

12.	Does FDA currently have a vendor performing these requirements?

	Answer: No.

13.	Will answers to the questions due on 22 June be posted? 

	Answer: Please see answer to Question 9 above.
	
14.	What is the anticipated level of effort for this requirement? 

	Answer: The government cannot anticipate the level of effort, which will vary 	between vendors due to their technical capabilities, experiences, and resources.

15.	On page 4, under task 1.2, you specify that you're looking to obtain the number of page views and visitors: Are these metrics for 
	A - the FDA website
	B - the traffic on the sites providing coverage of the FDA traffic
	C- the traffic generated per article on 3rd party content providers in regard to the 	FDA health communication.

Answer: These metrics are for all sources listed in B and C only.  Please also see answers to Questions 3 and 4 above.

16.	What font sizes are required and should we place the resume, information about previous projects, and the business proposal in the appendix of the Technical proposal or have them as separate documents that are referenced in Technical proposal? "The offeror shall submit a technical proposal that covers the work in the scope of work. The technical proposal shall not exceed 15 pages exclusive of resumes and information about previous projects. The offeror shall submit a business proposal that includes ceiling hourly rates for all labor categories."

Answer:  A font size larger than 11 is preferred.  Resumes and information about previous projects can be included in the proposal as separate documents that are referenced in the technical proposal.  Please also see answer to Question 1 above.

17.	Does that deadline extension also extend the period during which we may submit e-mail questions from the previously posted: QUESTIONS DEADLINE: All questions are to be submitted via email to Vida.Niles@fda.hhs.gov, no later June 22, 2009, 4:30 pm EST?

Answer: No

18.	We have some minor clarification questions specific to reporting requirements noted for which there may not be specific reporting options:

	Task 2.2 --  The reports shall include, at a minimum, the following items:

2. Number of page views and unique visitors  Question: This data is only 100% accurately available to site owners and not public information.  We can report on third-party estimates for site visitors and general (not specific) numbers of page views.  Would this meet FDAs requested reporting requirement? 

Answer: Thirty-party estimates for site visitors and general numbers of page views would be acceptable substitutes for 100% accurately available metrics.  The proposal, however, should clearly explain the estimation methodology and, if available, any indicators of how these estimates compare to the 100% accurately available metrics. Please also see answers to Questions 3 and 4 above.

4. Site profiles in visitors/participants demographic characteristics such as gender, age, parenthood status, etc.  Question: General demographic profile data (gender, age, race, parenthood) estimates are available for many well-trafficked sites; however, these are estimated data and the details and quality of this data diminish with lesser-trafficked sites, with some sites having no such data available. As we would be reporting on all types of sites, would those types of demographic estimates and notations where such data does not exist for low visibility sites be sufficient to meet FDAs requirements?

Answer: Please see answers to Questions 3 and 4 above.

19.	With regard to cost management and past performance required documentation  will clearly legible screen shots of spread sheets embedded with detailed corresponding written explanations into the RFP response document be acceptable support documentation, or do we need to submit the original spread sheets as supplemental attachments (if so, what formats/versions are acceptable)?

Answer: Yes, clearly legible screen shots of spread sheets embedded with detailed corresponding written explanations into the RFP response document are acceptable support documentation.

<RESPDATE>071009
<CONTACT>Richard Cordero, Phone 3019753976, Email rcordero@nist.gov
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer to recent questions regarding the solicitation or concerns from interested parties. The following questions have been submitted to the NIST office:

Question 1: 
PWS section, Item 1, Par. 2 states: "Provide Chemical Reference Data Group personnel with expertise in digitizing 35 mm microfilm to JPEG format with grayscale quality without losing any data".  The section "without losing any data" is the clause on which we are requesting clarification.  To explain our reasoning on this... the standard JPEG image format utilizes what is known as a "lossy" compression algorithm.  Lossy compression infers the discarding of some image data in order to achieve a high compression ratio, and this is done for the purpose of reducing file size.  Alternatively, lossless JPEG compression is available at additional cost, but the resulting files are considerably larger and more cumbersome to deal with from storage, transport and bandwidth standpoints.  We need to understand your needs regarding this detail in order to respond accordingly to the intent of the RFQ.
NIST Response: Data refers to visual appearance of spectrum (loss of compression)

Question 2:
The entire section beginning with "1194.24 Video and multimedia products." (a) through (e) seem to have nothing to do with this RFQ.  Can we ignore this portion of the solicitation text?
NIST Response: Section 508 requirements are not required.

Questions 3: 
In PWS number 2, there is a reference to an interface that will enable the user to navigate to individual files and search by roll and image number.  Is this expected to be a separate software product issued by the vendor?  Or can we simply recommend a means to view them  i.e. Acrobat Viewer and File Browser?
NIST Response: What is needed is a way to quickly locate and view individual scans.  We must be able to locate scans by roll and image number.

Question 4:
The RFQ stated that you wanted the contractor to Provide Chemical Reference Data Group personnel with expertise in digitizing 35 mm microfilm to JPEG format with grayscale quality without losing any data.  Can I assume that the personnel will come to our facility for training? 
NIST Response: This section is being deleted from the solicitation since no training is required 

Question 5:       Regarding the above questionHave you considered the need to purchase equipment for your personnel to use when they digitize microfilm. 
NIST Response: NIST has no plans to purchase equipment.

Questions 6: Can you provide us with one sample image so we may see what exactly we are working with? 
NIST Response:A sample image is provided as an attachment in this amendment 

Question 7: 
Is there a limitation as to distance the microfilm can be shipped for scanning? 

NIST Response: The Micro Film will be delivered to the destination and pick up from the destination by NIST personnel. NIST will not send the Micro Film via postal service or any other service since this is the original microfilm and NIST wants to eliminate shipping mishandlings and potential for damage to the originals. Therefore, because NIST must deliver the original in person, the offerors facilities must be within 120 miles of NIST in Gaithersburg, Maryland. 

Question 8:
Is this job to be kept within the continental USA? 
NIST Response: Yes, See question 7

Question: 
Are these DVDs to be viewed on a computer or a TV?
NIST Response:  Computer

Question 9:  If viewed on a computer why do closed captions need to be included on the DVDs as well as indexing?
NIST Response: See question 2

Question 10:   If viewed on a computer do you need an audio track to be included on the DVDs
NIST Response: See Question 2

The closing date has been changed to June 10, 2009 at 5:00 Pm ESt to allow time to review the questions.

<p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY for market research purposes to identify interested vendors for the requirement detailed below. A formal Solicitation, with Performance Work Statements or Technical Exhibits is not available for review at this time. Information obtained from this sources sought notice may result in a future formal Request for Proposal. The Government reserves the right to set-aside any subsequent acquisition based upon known sources and/or responses to this synopsis.</p>
<p>We are conducting research to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience needed to meet the requirement to collect missile-fly out data. The offeror must be able to track two missiles in-flight simultaneously to collect and produce time, space, and position information (TSPI) which is accurate and precise from first light through the endgame. It will be necessary to correlate the TSPI data to other test events such as first light and first motion. Missile roll-rate and attitude data are also required. One hour after each launch event, the contractor must provide quick look data to the test engineer. Thirty days after the conclusion of the test event, the offeror must provide a final and complete data package.</p>
<p>Services will be conducted at remote locations, such as Ft Bliss, Tonopah Test Range, White Sands Missile Range, or China Lake. Tentatively, the test dates are 21 Sep - 15 Nov 2009. Missiles will be fired from several different locations, late at night, 5 days a week<br /><br />To support this activity, the government may provide the following equipment: two HAWK radars, two generators to support field operations, and fuel to run the generators. The government will provide transportation for the assets listed above to/from the test location. In addition, fuel for the generators will be delivered and any required field maintenance of the generators will be provided by the government. If radars are provided by the government, the contractor shall present documentation which certifies the offeror is qualified to operate and perform field maintenance.</p>
<p>The offeror must provide all other equipment and services necessary to collect and deliver the required data. These activities may include, but are not limited to the following: set-up and movement of radars, generators, instrumentation and other support equipment; maintenance of radars and offeror equipment while in the field; participation in daily test readiness reviews; providing all other equipment, software and services necessary to deliver the data requested.</p>
<p>Offerors offering simultaneous missile tracking capability using radars other than HAWK radars are also acceptable. Offerors shall identify the equipment they are qualified on and if the offeror will provide their own equipment or will require Government Furnished Equipment (GFE).</p>
<p>Data collected is anticipated to be classified as SECRET/US only. The offeror must be domestic and may not partner or subcontract with a foreign business entity in support of the data collection activities. Offerors must have SECRET facility clearance, SECRET storage capability and provide a minimum of 2 personnel cleared to handle SECRET data. Only offerors that meet the description of this requirement need to respond.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code for this effort is 517919 (formerly 517910), with a small business size standard of $25M.</p>
<p>All interested parties shall submit a capabilities package which explicitly demonstrates capabilities and expertise related to this effort. The capabilities package should include the following:</p>
<p>1) The Offeror must identify all the equipment to be provided/operated for the purpose of providing the data defined in this Sought Synopsis.</p>
<p>2) Identification of radar equipment the contractor is certified to operate and maintain.</p>
<p>3) Tracking system performance information such as range, rate of position update, tracking acceleration.</p>
<p><br />4) If the offeror has provided this service in the past, list the number and percent of missiles tracked.</p>
<p>5) The offeror may provide information about any other tracking tests they have supported; pertinent information would be objective of test, and data products provided.</p>
<p>Your package should demonstrate capabilities, expertise and past performance relevant to the requirements cited above as well as your size in accordance with the size standard; ensure that the company name, address, a point of contact with email address and telephone number, Federal CAGE code and Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number are included in the capabilities package.</p>
<p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY for market research purposes only and is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). No solicitation is being issued at this time and this notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Participation is strictly voluntary with no cost or obligation to be incurred by the Government.</p>
<p>The Air Armament Center has appointed an Ombudsman to hear concerns from potential offerors relating to this acquisition. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the Program Director or Contracting Officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the offeror of the concern.

The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. <br />(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC>=========================================================================
The following information serves as the second and FINAL Amendment to Sources Sought Solicitation FTA-09-0529. The questions and answers posted below have come in as a result of the initial posting and NO FURTHER QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS SOLICITATION WILL BE ANSWERED.  

AGAIN, PLEASE NOTE THAT A VENDORS LIST WILL NOT BE COMPILED AS A RESULT OF THIS SOURCES SOUGHT. Therefore, if your firm is interested in responding to this notice, please submit your Capabilities Statement as detailed within the solicitation.

Thank you,
=========================================================================


What is the proper way for a vendor to communicate with the chosen contractor to make them aware of a software package that meets the needs of this solicitation?

Answer: After a vendor is chosen, an announcement of award will be posted to FedBiz.

 

What criteria will be used to evaluate prospective responses?

Answer:  At this stage there are no criteria.  Vendors are to identify their "capabilities" in accordance with what is stated in the announcement.  


Will requirements and technical options identified by FTA be made available to responders?

Answer:  No


Is the Department of Transportation requesting a fixed bid or time and material response?

Answer:  This is "To Be Determined."

 
The solicitation notes that it will be a "competitive set aside for small businesses only." Are bidders required to be certified as small businesses or do total revenues just need to be below the small business thresholds for the NAICS codes? If certification is required, which agency shall provide the certification?

Answer:  The only requirement is that prospective bidders be registered in the Central Contractor Registry as a small business.   

 

The solicitation states that qualifications are being requested for information and planning purposes only, and that a contract may be awarded as a result of the solicitation. Could you please elaborate on the factors that might influence the FTA's decision to award a contract or not, and the timing of that decision?

Having the ability to monitor and analyze CGM will allow SSA to answer key business questions related to how the public views the services and information that SSA provides, and about how the public is responding to issues and concerns related to SSA.  

This requirement will be set-aside exclusively for small business and will be procured using procedures from Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12 in conjunction with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. SSA anticipates awarding a firm-fixed price award with a period of performance beginning August 30, 2009, and ending August 29, 2010. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition will be 541910, with a size standard of $7.0 million. Solicitation number SSA-RFQ-09-1574, is scheduled for release on or about June 30, 2009, with quotes due eight business days thereafter. 

The solicitation will be available for viewing on the Governmentwide Point of Entry website, Federal Business Opportunities or FedBizOps (www.fbo.gov). HARD COPIES OF THE RFQ WILL NOT BE MAILED. Potential offerors are responsible for accessing the FedBizOpps website to check the status of this requirement and to keep current with any amendments that may be issued. Interested parties must respond to the solicitation in order to be considered for award of any resultant purchase order. All questions must be submitted via email to christopher.abrecht@ssa.gov. No phone calls will be accepted.

RFP Number: 486-09-026
Issue Date:	July 7, 2009
Closing Date:August 6, 2009 4:00 p.m. Bangkok Time

The United States Government, represented by the U.S. Agency for International Development, Regional Development Mission Asia (USAID/RDMA), Bangkok, Thailand is seeking proposals from qualified organizations interested in providing the construction services as set forth in the attached documents.

Due to the nature of the work, all firms submitting proposals must be fully registered with the Government of Thailand to provide the required services prior to the closing date.  All firms submitting proposals must comply with Thai labor laws and practices, as well as providing proof of citizenship and work permits for non-Thai workers.  All workers assigned to a contract awarded pursuant to this solicitation will be required to submit to a Royal Thai Police background check to ascertain suitability to work on this project.

USAID/RDMA anticipates one award under this solicitation.  Please note that the U.S. Government may award this contract without discussions and as such initial proposals should represent the best possible and most competitive terms available.

The closing date and time, as well as other aspects of the RFP may be modified.  All modifications to this RFP will be placed on the Government Point of Entry (GPE) which is at http://www.fbo.gov.  Any amendments to this solicitation will be issued and posted through the GPE.  While USAID/RDMA intends to place this RFP and the amendments on the USAID/RDMA Mission website, it is the GPE that is the official website for the RFP and all amendments.  Any amendments will be mailed to all firms requesting copies of the RFP.

USAID/RDMA is pursuing the accreditation of the commercial office space we are outfitting under the U.S. Green Building Councils (USGBC) program entitled, Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System, found at http://www.usgbc.org/leed.  The RFP contains an addendum that addresses the processes and documents that are required of the contractor to meet the requirements.  To these ends, the specifications contained in this document will be modified to incorporate LEED requirements.  USAID/RDMA expects to modify the RFP in mid-July to incorporate the LEED specifications. The due date for the submittal of proposals will be extended at this time to provide offerors ample time to review the changes, formulate any questions, and submit a proposal.  The purpose of releasing this document prior to finalizing the LEED specifications is to allow firms to prepare and acquaint themselves with the requirements of LEED.
Additionally, USAID/RDMA is in the final stages of negotiating the Athenee Tower lease and their Fit Out Guide that is included in the List of Specifications and Drawings will be updated in a modification to the RFP.  It is anticipated that the changes to the Fit Out Guide will be completed in early July and will be issued at the same time that the changes to the specifications required of the LEED program are issued. 
Any firm wishing to visit the site prior to submitting a proposal for the work must contact the below listed Contracting Officer.  

Due to time constraints, all offerors who are selected for negotiations should be prepared to meet with USAID/RDMA within two calendar days after notification of a request for negotiations by USAID/RDMA.  Currently, it is anticipated that this will occur approximately 14 calendar days after the closing date listed above.  After negotiations, firms will be expected to submit their best and final offer within approximately 4 calendar days.  The selected firm will be expected to mobilize and begin work within 10 calendar days after notification of award and being issued a notice to proceed by the Contracting Officer.  During this 10 day period, all required bonds and insurance must be obtained and submitted to the Contracting Officer and other designated individuals.

<DESC>REVISION- REMOVAL OF QUESTION NUMBER 3 to the RFI notice.  TCRD referenced in this document has already been posted.<BR> <BR>Joint Urban Test Capability (JUTC)<BR>Request for Information (RFI)<BR><BR>Closing Date: 27 JULY 2009<BR><BR>Synopsis:<BR>The Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI); Project Manager for Instrumentation, Targets and Threat Simulators (PM ITTS) and the Instrumentation Management Office (IMO), as the material developer for the Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP), are seeking industry information on available products and technologies to further define/refine the requirements and the acquisition approach for the Joint Urban Test Capability (JUTC).  Attachment 1 is the draft JUTC Test Capabilities Requirements Document (TCRD).  Once the TCRD is approved, all the performance specifications and Statement of Work (SOW) will be derived from the approved TCRD.  Request for information responses may address available products and technologies to produce components or a complete capability to provide new test capabilities to fully support all current and emerging requirements to test current, new, and emerging technologies and systems within an urban environment.  JUTC will be a comprehensive solution to enhance the developmental and operational testing capabilities at each of the test ranges.  PM ITTS is the lead for the acquisition of this capability.   <BR><BR>Background:<BR>The U.S. military has an immediate need for a robust Joint Urban Operations (JUO) testing capability.  The 2006 Quadrennial Defense Report identifies the ability to operate in urban terrain as a critical capability requirement.  A major requirement for JUO testing is a set of realistic urban environments ranging from small rural villages to modern metropolises that pose challenges to air, ground, and maritime systems and system-of-systems (SoS) operating as part of a Joint Task Force (JTF).  While limited representations of small urban environments exist, current urban test and training facilities have deficiencies of size, complexity, realism, and control that prevent them from completely fulfilling this requirement.  If the military cannot test in operationally realistic Joint urban environments, the JTF will be hard pressed to achieve its objectives / goals during hybrid, full spectrum Joint operations.  This need was outlined in the 2007 DoD Strategic Plan for T&E Resources.  To better understand the need, the Strategic Plan called for an Urban Environment Test Capability (UETC) study to define the urban environment test capability requirements for a realistic, reconfigurable, instrumented urban test environment, which makes use of existing DoD infrastructure and advancements in distributed live-virtual-constructive (LVC) capabilities.  <BR><BR>The JUTC program may develop a myriad of technical solutions to include augmentation of existing live urban test ranges with advanced data collection systems and effects generators, as well as linking and integrating these live ranges with virtual and constructive urban simulations for a distributed, capability-based Joint urban test environment for Joint brigade and below force structure operations.  JUTC will provide:<BR>* Common test architecture<BR>* Common structural augmentation<BR>* Common test tools<BR>* Common threats and human-social-cultural behavior (HSCB) representations<BR>* Common test management and control<BR><BR>Industry Day:<BR>Interaction with Industry will be a multi-step process.  Step one is the release of a draft TCRD and the complete Request for Information (RFI).  It is the Governments intent to conduct an Industry Day in Orlando, Florida on 25 - 26 June 2009. The intent of the Industry Day is to clearly present the Governments requirements to potential bidders.  Following the Government presentations, Industry will have the opportunity to participate in one-on-one interaction with the customer during the afternoon of 25 June 2009 and all day on 26 June 2009.  Responses to the RFI will be completed 30 days after the Industry Day, specifically 27 July 2009 or sooner.  Step two, is to conduct a second Industry Day in Orlando, Florida on 25  26 August 2009.  Preceding the 2nd Industry Day, the Government will release an updated draft TCRD and RFI.  One-on-one discussions with the customer will be available on the afternoon of 25 August 2009 and all day on 26 August 2009.  <BR><BR>Detailed Requirements:<BR>PM ITTS is looking for suppliers who can provide live, virtual and constructive technologies and capabilities that may be used alone or in conjunction with other technologies / systems to provide the required test capability.  Technologies of specific interest include electromagnetic interference (EMI) emitters capable of replicating the various contributors to the electromagnetic spectrum of specified geographical urban environments; transportable urban structures and facades, which replicate specific global urban areas and replicate the electronic absorption/reflection characteristics of the representative buildings and building materials; technologies to emulate/simulate/create a GPS-denied environment; technologies that enable tracking of troops and vehicles within the various challenges posed by an urban environment; data fusion capabilities to provide decision-ready information/results; and comprehensive test instrumentation/Tactical Engagement Simulation System (TESS) to collect and transmit all environmental, player-unit, and system-under-test performance and TSPI data.  In addition there may be a need to better define the Electromagnetic Environment (EME) characteristics (e.g., bandwidth, strength, range, etc.) for various emitters in the projected future theater urban areas as to their source, profile, and aggregate effects and impacts on performance of US systems and technology.   Commercial and non-development solutions are preferred where the end-system would provide the capabilities stated above.  However, developmental efforts to acquire currently unavailable technologies are invited.  PM ITTS is interested in suppliers who can provide a completely integrated capability, as well as those who can provide separate component capabilities.  All respondents are asked to provide the following:<BR><BR>1. A technical description of the potential solutions or complete capability.  The description should answer the following:<BR>a. What part of the overall capability does your solution address?<BR>b. How does your solution work?  What are its limits?<BR>c. What are the physical dimensions and weight of your solution? <BR>d. Has your solution been used in similar test and evaluation requirements? Where has this application been applied?<BR>e. What evidence supports your solution is applicable if it has not been used in similar test and evaluation requirements?<BR>f. How mature is your system?  Is it new development?  Is it already in production?  Does a prototype exist?  Is it similar to previous successful developments?  Is it an extension or evolution of an existing product? <BR>g. How much of the design will be an integration of commercial components? What type of components are parts of your solution?  What part of the solution has to be developed?<BR>2. An estimated schedule from contract award to operational capability.<BR>3. REMOVED<BR>4. Recommendations where performance can be traded for reduced costs or can be added for little or no cost.<BR>5. Identification of inconsistencies in the draft TCRD and any unrealistic requirements? The Government may accept some, none, or all of the comments provided to the draft TCRD.<BR>6. Identification of critical technical/cost/and schedule drivers.<BR>7. A description of the contractors familiarization of TENA requirements.<BR>8. A detailed approach to logistics management.<BR>9. Any history of sustainability costs of the proposed system solution. <BR>10. Identification of any areas that need science and technology development.<BR>11. The Govt has not finalized the parameters of the acquisition approach and is interested in soliciting industry perspective on the most effective means.  The Government may consider a single or multiple prime contractors to support the effort.  In your response, please provide your recommendation as to contract type along with your reasoning as to that selection.  <BR>12. The acquisition strategy mentioned earlier is in the beginning stages.  One of the items that the Government is considering is a statement of objectives approach.  This would require each contractor to respond with a SOW as a part of the eventual proposal that would address the objectives.  Please, include your perspective as part of your response to the RFI, the pros and cons as you see them, as well as your experience and if your company would recommend this approach or not.<BR>13. Contractors shall indicate if they are a large or small business (if small, please indicate any applicable socio-economic status such as Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), 8(a), etc.), if they are interested in participating as the prime contractor or as a subcontractor, and if they are planning to team with other companies for this contract.<BR>     14.  If a small business and intending to prime this effort, please answer the following:<BR>a. If you are expecting to prime this effort, can you meet the limitations of subcontracting, as stated in FAR clause 52.219-14?  If so, how?<BR>b. Due to the delays that occur in the DFAS system, do you have enough resources to continue without payment for 60 to 90 days?<BR>c. Have you ever been a prime contractor on something of this complexity and of a similar nature?  If so please describe effort.  What dollar value?  Length of time?  In terms of the JUTC, how long would it take you to obtain the appropriate resources?<BR>d. How you propose to meet the Non-manufacturer Rule (FAR 19.502-2) which states that the Small Business must be the manufacturer of the end item being procured (and the end item must be manufactured or produced in the United States) or it must obtain the product from another Small Business?<BR><BR>RFI Purpose and Limitations:<BR>The Government desires to better understand the current state-of-the-art to determine the best acquisition approach.  Industry feedback is vitally important and the Government is receptive to any and all ideas received from industry.  This RFI is an expression of the Governments interest only and does not obligate the Government to pay for the requested information nor respond to any submissions.  Proprietary information is not being solicited; however, if it is submitted, it should be appropriately marked.  There is no limit on the length of your submission.  Formal white paper shall include a cover letter.  In addition, you may include up to five attachments consisting of pre-printed commercial brochures or sales literature.  Electronic submissions are strongly encouraged.  Electronic responses shall be in MS Word or Adobe PDF format.  Please submit responses to PEOSTRI, ATTN: SFAE-STRI-KOT (Mrs. Caryn McGraw), 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL  32826 or e-mail caryn.mcgraw@us.army.mil.

<DESC>CLARIFICATIONS:

Potential offerors have requested clarification on several issues:

1.  The existing conditions drawings provided were limited, and in particular electrical drawings were missing.  We will not require reconstruction of plant MEP drawings as part of the record drawings process.  Record drawings must accurately reflect all equipment installed as part of this project, and must contain plant layouts to the extent that GSA can provide existing plant drawings as a basis for this.  

2.  Design drawings (submitted during the design phase, not as part of proposals) must be stamped by an appropriate PE registered in any state.

3.  The Contractor will be expected to commission the systems impacted regardless of whether GSA hires a third-party commissioning agent.  The Contractor will not be required to hire a third party commissioning agent, but is expected to have competent personnel perform pre-functional and functional performance testing.  Functional performance testing must thorougly test all sequences of operation.  Because this project includes new plant controls and programming, all plant sequences (chilled and hot water systems) must be tested.  If GSA hires a third party commissioning agent, such commissioning agent will be given authority to approve in advance the commissioning process and tests proposed by the Contractor.

These work items were identified in an inspection of the boiler plant by ACCE Facilities Management in February 2009.General Requirements:  Contractor to provide all materials, trained labor, tools and equipment to complete the work as outlined in the statement of work.Work on burners and control systems must be performed by skilled boiler/burner controls service technicians.  Upon completion of each work item, test operation and provide data sheet showing test results including set point and operating point.All testing procedures must comply with VHA Boiler Plant Safety Device Testing Manual, 3rd Edition.Scope of work:Boiler Nos.  1, 2, 3 and 4 (Work common to all boilers):1.	The low water cutoffs (LWCO) and the auxiliary low water cutoffs (ALWCO) share common lower (water) connections to the boiler steam drums.  This is hazardous because the single connections could become clogged and make both devices inoperative.  Also, there are manual valves in the water connections to the steam drums that are not locked open. (Safety Testing Evaluation Report  Par. 5.1.2, 7.1.2)a.	Disconnect the lower (water) connections on the ALWCO from the LWCO (water column) lower (water) piping.  The upper (steam) connections to the steam drum can remain unchanged.b.	Connect the ALWCO water piping to the pipe connections on the steam drums that are now connected to the Copes feedwater regulator thermostatic tubes.  Verify that these steam drum water connections are 1 pipe size minimum (ASME Code requirement).  Note that the Copes regulators and thermostatic tubes will be removed in the new controls project.c.	All changes in piping direction must be done with cross fittings.d.	Lock the manual valves in the steam and water piping between the LWCO, ALWCO and the steam drums in the open position.e.	The work on Boilers 2 and 3 will require rerouting the existing 2 feedwater lines at the fronts of the boilers.2.	The auxiliary low water cutoffs (ALWCO) did not activate when the water level was within the limits of the gage glasses. The set points of the low water alarms (LWA), low water cutoffs (LWCO), and auxiliary low water cutoffs (ALWCO) should be adjusted so that there is water visible in the sight glasses when the ALWCO is actuated. (5.1.1, 5.1.2, 5.1.3, 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 7.1.3, 9.1.1, 9.1.2)a.	Recommended set points for the devices:i.	LWA: 4. 5 inches water in gage glass.ii.	LWCO:  3.0 inches water in gage glass.iii.	ALWCO:  1.5 inches water in gage glass.b.	Adjust set points per recommendation.c.	Test set points and operation of the low water devices.3.	The steam safety valve drip pan ells are contacted by J bolts welded to the bottoms of the vent pipes.  The thermal expansion of the vent pipes may place excessive stresses on the safety valves and affect their operation. (5.2.1, 7.2.1, 9.2.1)a.	Provide clearance between the drip pan and the vent pipe components.b.	Refer to attached Steam Safety Valve Details.4.	The main burner gas pressure regulators do not maintain a constant pressure over the firing range and allows too much pressure droop.  This adversely affects the ability to properly set the set points of the low gas pressure fuel cutoff switches (LPFCS). (5.3.1, 7.3.1)a.	Repair or replace the pressure regulators so that they maintain a nearly constant gas pressure throughout the firing range.  The allowable droop must not exceed 10% of the regulated pressure setting.b.	Adjust the LPFCS set points to 80% of the regulated pressure.c.	Test the switch and interlock operation.5.	The high gas pressure fuel cutoff switches (HPFCS) are set at pressures which are too high.  The switches are not plumbed for testing. (5.3.2, 7.3.2, 9.3.2)a.	Add lockable isolation valves (lockable only in the open position) and pressure test ports between the gas mains and the switches.b.	Refer to attached Burner Gas Piping Schematic Diagram.c.	Correct the pressure regulation problems as listed in Par. 5 above.d.	Set the pressure switches to 120% of the regulated pressure.e.	Test the switch and interlock operation.6.	Make provisions to allow seat leak testing of the main gas automatic solenoid vent valve. (5.3.4, 7.3.4, 9.3.4)a.	Add pressure taps and manual valves (lockable only in the open position) downstream of the automatic vent valves.b.	Refer to attached Burner Gas Piping Schematic Diagram.c.	Test the vent valves for seat leakage.7.	On the pilot gas trains, the automatic vent valves have no provision for seat leak testing. (5.3.7, 7.3.7, 9.3.7)a.	Install a pressure tap after the automatic vent valve.b.	Install a manual valve lockable only in the open position after the automatic vent valve.c.	Refer to attached Burner Gas Piping Schematic Diagram.d.	Test valves for seat leakage.8.	The high fuel oil pressure cutout switches (HFOPCS) and low fuel oil pressure cutout switches (LFOPCS) on each boiler are connected to the fuel oil piping upstream from the Cleaver-Brooks fuel oil controllers.  This location does not protect against failure of the pressure regulators in the C-B controllers.   (5.4.1, 5.4.2, 7.4.1, 7.4.2, 9.4.1, 9.4.2)a.	Disconnect the pressure switches from the current locations and connect                                                                                                      them to the pressure gage connections on the Cleaver-Brooks fuel oil controllers.  b.	Reconnect the pressure gages.                                                       c.	Set the HFOPCS to 110% of regulated pressure.  Set the LFOPCS to 90% of regulated pressure.  9.	On the combustion air pressure switches, the valve between the windbox and the sensor must be lockable only in the open position and a keyed lock provided.  The set pressures of the switches were too low. The pressure settings must be adjusted to 80% of the minimum pressure seen across the firing range. (5.5.8, 7.5.8, 9.5.8)a.	Provide valves lockable only in the open position.b.	Adjust pressure settings as listed below:i.	Boiler No. 1:  12.8 inches wc.ii.	Boiler No. 2:  12.8 inches wc.iii.	Boiler No. 3:  13.2 inches wc.10.	The prepurge airflow proving switches close at 0.1 inch wc which is not effective, considering that the normal prepurge air differential pressure is 13 inches wc.  The required setting is 80% of 13 inches wc.  Also, the switches have a maximum pressure rating of 13.9 inches wc, which indicates that the switches are not suitable for the application. (5.5.10, 7.5.10, 9.5.10)a.	Replace the switches with switches which have the correct pressure range.b.	Adjust the pressure settings so that the switches close at 10.4 inches wc.c.	Verify proper operation of the switches and interlocks.11.	On each boiler provide low flue gas oxygen interlocks in the burner management control circuits that will automatically shut down the burners if the flue gas oxygen falls below a safe level.  (5.5.14, 7.5.14, 9.5.14)a.	Utilize the existing flue gas oxygen analyzers to provide the low oxygen signals.b.	Adjust the set points of the interlocks to approximately 0.5% oxygen above the point where the flue gas CO starts to climb above 200 ppm.c.	 Test interlock operation.     Boiler No. 1 (Work limited to Boiler No. 1):1.	Steam safety valve No. 2 has a lift pressure of 155 psi which is too high when compared with the set pressure (145 psi). The allowable variation is 3% (4.5 psi).  The drip pan ell drains are clogged. (Safety Testing Evaluation Report Par. 5.2.1)a.	Repair or replace valve.b.	Clean drip pan ell drains.c.	Test safety valve set point, blowdown and accumulation.2.	The low oil atomizing media pressure switch (LAMPS) is set too low.  It should be set at 80% of the minimum atomizing media pressure during prepurge, which was observed as 10 psi. (5.4.3)a.	Adjust the switch to trip the boiler when the atomizing media pressure drops to 8 psi.b.	Test switch and interlock operation.Boiler No. 2 (Work limited to Boiler No. 2):1.	The low oil atomizing media pressure switch (LAMPS) is set too low.  It should be set at 80% of the minimum atomizing media pressure during prepurge, which was observed as 12 psi. (Safety Testing Evaluation Report Par. 7.4.3)a.	Adjust the switch to trip the boiler when the atomizing media pressure drops to 9.6 psi.b.	Test switch and interlock operation.2.	The proof of closure (POC) switch on the upstream automatic fuel oil safety shut off valve opens at approximately 50% of the valve travel.  The switch should open with minimal valve movement. (7.4.5)a.	Consult with a representative of ASCO valves on a solution for this problem.b.	After making the corrections, retest the POC operation.3.	The audible alarm did not function.  Repair and make audible throughout the plant.Boiler No. 3 (Work limited to Boiler No. 3):1.	The high water alarm (HWA) switch activated with the water level 0.5 inches from the top of the gage glass, which is too high. (Safety Testing Evaluation Report Par. 9.1.4)a.	Adjust the set point of the high water alarm to approximately 2 inches from the top of the gage glass.b.	Test the alarm operation.2.	The low oil atomizing media pressure switch (LAMPS) is set too low.  It should be set at 80% of the minimum atomizing media pressure during prepurge, which was observed as 7 psi. (9.4.3)a.	Adjust the switch to trip the boiler when the atomizing media pressure drops to 5.6 psi.b.	Test switch and interlock operation.3.	The audible alarm did not function.  Repair and make audible throughout the plant.Plant Support Equipment:1.	The condensate storage tank high water alarm switch is a float type.  The float type switches have a high failure rate in this service.  There are valves in the high and low level alarm switch header that can isolate the alarm switches from the tank and make them ineffective.  (Safety Testing Evaluation Report Par. 4.1)a.

There is no ASME  NB approved steam safety valve following the steam pressure reducing station (PRV) that serves the feedwater deaerator (DA).  A safety valve is essential to protect downstream equipment if the pressure reducing valve fails open and allows the pressure to increase.  In addition, an isolation valve must be installed on the low pressure steam line between the new safety valve and the DA so that the DA can be isolated to allow testing the new safety valve. (4.7)a.	Install new safety valve downstream of the PRV.  The safety valve sizing shall be based on the maximum flow capacity of the PRV or the globe bypass, whichever is greater.b.	Refer to attached Steam Safety Valve Detail.6.	There are three steam pressure reducing stations (PRV) in the vicinity of the feedwater deaerator.  The bypass valves are difficult to turn and therefore could not accommodate the testing of the downstream safety valves.  The bypass sizes appear excessive.  Downstream safety valve sizes and capacities must be based on the maximum flow capacity of the PRV or the bypass, whichever is greater.   There must be isolation valves downstream from the PRV station safety valves to allow testing the safety valves without over pressuring the downstream systems. (4.7)a.	Perform an engineering analysis of the flow capacities of the PRVs and bypass valves to determine the required safety valve capacities.b.	If the bypass globe valves have excessive capacity, consider installing smaller globe valves.c.	Verify that the existing safety valves have proper capacities and set pressures or replace them.d.	Test the set points and accumulation of all the safety valves.7.	The propane tanks and connecting piping are inadequate to serve the pilot burners.(4.8)a.	Install proper size tanks and piping with proper pressure regulation.b.	Test operation of propane pilot burner backup system.8.	The relief valves on each of the fuel oil pumps do not relieve the full flow of the pumps without an excessive increase in pressure above the set pressure.  (4.9)a.	Replace the valves with properly sized valves with set pressure 10 psi above the regulated pressure.b.	Test the relief valve operation.9.	Provisions must be made for admission of combustion air into the boiler room.  As an example, at 20,000 lb/hr of steam output, the burners will require 5000 cfm of combustion air.  If another boiler is being pre-purged at the same time, the total requirement will be approximately 10,000 cfm.  (4.11)i.	Replace windows with storm proof louvers with sufficient free area to limit pressure drop to 0.05 inches WC at the maximum air intake rate.  It may be necessary to enlarge window openings.a.	Develop standard operating procedures to assure adequate combustion air.System Compliance/ReliabilityCommon Issues Noted in the Plant:1.	Many burner/boiler control safety interlock switches require isolating valves to allow testing or servicing.  These isolating valves will make the switch inoperative if they are closed.  It is essential that these valves be lockable only in the open position.  Plant procedures must require that they be locked open.  This plant has several isolating valves that were not locked or were lockable in more than one position.2.	Many of the pressure gages are inaccurate.  A pressure gage calibration program is required by the VA directive.

<DESC><p>RECOVERY
<p>Synopsis:</p>
<p>On July 24, 2008, the Department of Energy (DOE) and the EPA entered into an Interagency Agreement as a result of Public Law 110-161. The public law directed the DOE to utilize funding to enter into an Interagency Agreement with The EPA to conduct a joint comprehensive radioactive characterization of Area IV of the Santa Susana Field Laboratory (SSFL) at the Energy Technology Engineering Center (ETEC) site. Under the current Interagency Agreement the DOE provides funds to the EPA so that EPA can 1) conduct a background study to determine site specific background values for radiological contaminants at the SSFL, 2) develop a scope of work, schedule and cost estimate for the first phase of a radiological survey of SSFL Area IV and buffer zone areas adjacent to Area IV, 3) conduct a Historical Site Assessment (HSA) evaluating past radiological activities at SSFL, and 4) develop a workplan for a Radiological Study of SSFL Area IV and Buffer Zone areas adjacent to Area IV.</p>
<p>There is no additional work being added to the Interagency Agreement that is currently in place with the EPA. The Recovery Act funding will be utilized to fund work that was intended when the Interagency Agreement was executed. Because of a lack of funding availability, the DOE could not fund the Interagency Agreement fully at the time of execution. This funding will allow the DOE to fund the EPA, as required by Public Law No. 110-161, enabling EPA to complete the radiological characterization effort required for completion of cleanup at the ETEC site, on or ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>Rationale for using other than a fixed price and/or competitive award:</p>
<p>Competition was not considered due to Congressional direction to enter into an Interagency Agreement between the DOE and the EPA</p>

JUSTIFICATION FOR USE OF TIME-AND-MATERIALS CONTRACT TYPE

Upon the basis of the following findings and determination, the contract (both base period and option period) was negotiated as a time-and-materials contract type in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 16.601(d).

FINDINGS

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division proposes to enter into a time-and-materials contract to acquire non-commercial research services.  

NIST requires the rapid development of an Interim Roadmap with the maximum amount of consensus as practicable and possible among Smart Grid stakeholders, including those identified in the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007, to be delivered no later than May 28, 2009 to allow review, approval and transmittal by June 2009 to appropriate parties such as the U. S. Congress, the DOE including the Secretary of Energy, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  An accelerated deadline for the interim roadmap, which will be developed under this contract, is intended to minimize the risk to the Federal Government and private sector stakeholders utilizing the Smart Grid matching grants funds from the DOE.  This program requires that standards resulting from the NIST-coordinated interoperability framework be used as criteria for award of grants by the DOE.  The earlier those standards are adopted, the less risk to investments made by the Government and the private sector for the grants program.  This roadmap is important to the interoperability framework required by EISA 2007, which also requires coordination with DOE and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).

The Interim Roadmap provided under this contract shall be a document that describes the high-level Smart Grid architecture, principles and interface design; describes the current status, issues and priorities for interoperability standards development and harmonization; and includes an action plan that addresses these issues.  The contract will also include an option period of approximately forty-five days for the delivery of a consensus agreement document by August 15, 2009 identifying responsible (private-sector) entities for standards development and harmonization with a summary of unresolved issues.  

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) was enacted February 17, 2009 to address urgent national needs; a critical component supported by significant ARRA funding (over $4.5 billion) is to upgrade our Nations electric grid to produce the Smart Grid as described in EISA.  There is joint Obama Administration/Presidential and Congressional agreement on the urgency of this need to build the Smart Grid, and that as a critical part of this effort NIST must now accelerate the development of a framework to achieve interoperability of Smart Grid devices and systems.  Standards create stability that mitigates the risk of having equipment purchased and implemented that is not able to interoperate and unable to be upgradeable to remedy its shortcomings, with the result that it must be entirely replaced to be compatible with other equipment as the Smart Grid is developed (i.e., stranded investment).  The standards roadmap will identify existing standards and those that need to be developed or harmonized to establish the stable basis for Smart Grid devices and systems.  This action is required to reduce the risk of wasting substantial investment using ARRA funding and an equal or greater investment by the private sector in the Smart Grid.

The Secretary of the DOE and the Deputy Director of NIST, as well as many other government and industry leaders, have spoken directly on the urgent need to greatly accelerate the development of Smart Grid interoperability standards and roadmaps, with required timescales on the order of weeks to months instead of months to years.  At a March 3, 2009 hearing, the members of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources urged that rapid progress be made to address interoperability standards issues; the Deputy Director of NIST affirmed NISTs commitment to provide an interim standards roadmap by summer (June 2009).  The urgency and short timeline exceed NISTs ability to produce this interim roadmap with existing staff, requiring that this short-term contract be awarded by the beginning of April to provide sufficient time and resources to produce the Interim Roadmap to meet this urgent national need.

If normal, unrestricted full and open competitive procedures that involve publicizing and response times set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 5 for negotiated acquisitions were used, the award timeline of this contract would be at two to three months (fifteen days to advertise an acquisition in FedBizOpps, at least thirty days for potential offerors to submit a proposal, an appropriate time for the Government to evaluate proposals, and an appropriate time for internal agency reviews before an award decision is made) and would prevent the Interim Roadmap from being delivered in time to meet NISTs deadlines and commitments to Congress. 

With respect to qualifications to deliver an Interoperability Roadmap by the required date, it is critical that the contractor possess the required technical expertise, capabilities and associated experience in roadmap and Smart Grid standards development and harmonization to be able to develop, describe and implement a solid technical approach and plan. The contractor must also demonstrate experience providing similar services including interacting with broad stakeholder communities, to produce deliverables by required times. 

Due to the urgent requirement to complete the Interim Roadmap no later than May 28, 2009, the entire acquisition milestones process, including market research, has been significantly accelerated.  This accelerated schedule, along with the fact that it is not possible to accurately estimate the extent of Contractor effort required to achieve maximum practicable consensus among the Smart Grid stakeholder community that has widely divergent interests, makes it highly impracticable to utilize any form of fixed-price contract because of uncertainties involved in contract performance do not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any tope of fixed-price contract.  (Fixed-price types of contracts provide for a firm price or, in appropriate cases, an adjustable price when uncertainties are minimal and the Contractor can appropriately determine their risk.)  Utilizing a fixed-price contract for this requirement would also have the effect of significantly reducing competition and significantly increasing cost due to the uncertainties involved with contract performance. 

While cost reimbursement contract types allow the Government to assume an appropriate portion of the risk for contracts with inherent uncertainties in performance, provide for payment of allowable incurred costs to the extent prescribed in the contract as well as a method of calculating profit/fee, the Government anticipates that offers will be received largely from non-profit organizations whose accounting systems may never have been audited by a Government audit agency to provide appropriate capabilities for them to propose provisional indirect cost rates for this requirement, and their accounting systems may not be adequate for determining costs applicable to the contract.  Further, requesting and receiving an audit from a Government audit agency for this acquisition is not possible given that it would create unacceptable schedule risk for this acquisition that could jeopardize the required delivery date of May 28, 2009 for the interim roadmap required by this acquisition.

	Only a time-and-materials contract is suitable for this acquisition.  This is because, as demonstrated above, neither fixed-price nor cost-reimbursement contract types are appropriate for this acquisition and it is not possible at the time of placing the contract to estimate accurately the extent or duration of the work or to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence.  And, materials may be required by the Contractor to perform contract requirements, so a time-and-materials contract type is more appropriate than a labor-hour contract type.

It is also important to note that contract type, by regulation, is not something that the Government can unilaterally dictate.  It is always negotiable, per FAR Part 16.  Therefore, the Government must consider that when soliciting offers for this contract.  There is not sufficient time to enter into negotiations on this acquisition, and anticipating that the offerors would object to anything other than time-and-materials based on the previous discussion clearly indicates that the time-and-materials contract type should be utilized for this acquisition.
 
DETERMINATION

Based on the findings stated above and in accordance with FAR 16.601(c), it was determined that a  time-and-materials contract type would be the most appropriate contract type for this acquisition.  The COTR will closely monitor the Contractor to keep costs under control.  The end result is that the risk to the Government will be minimized.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center, Aircraft Division Lakehurst issued a sole source purchase order to ABB, Inc., of Norwalk, CT to repair and recommission the Static VAR Compensator (SVC), installed at the Naval Air Engineering Station, Lakehurst, NJ. ABB previously designed, fabricated, and installed the SVC in support of the Electro-magnetic Aircraft Launch System test site. The unique installation required specialized hardware and ABB is the only source that has the specialized knowledge and technical expertise to safely service and repair the system. Because the extent and duration of the work required to complete the repair cannot be accurately estimated in advance, costs cannot be projected with any reasonable degree of certainty. Therefore, to avoid over-inflated firm-fixed prices,  the repair is to be accomplished under a Time and Material order.

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) intends to make an award to Syscom Services Inc for the purchase of Snaps flow EAI System with 1 year subscription Lease and License. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is Section 303(c) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended by the Competition in Contracting Act [41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1)], implemented under FAR 6.302-1(a), which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The IRS is currently using Syscoms RightFax hardware and software in its e-Fax environment.   The requested barcoding software is an additional module to our already existing platform, which is proprietary to Syscom Services.   The e-Fax barcoding software will allow the Workforce of Tomorrow hiring initiative to receive and sort applications by barcode in an electronic format.   This software must be procured and installed in order to meet the aggressive hiring schedule.  

 This is not a solicitation for proposals or an invitation for bids. The Government does not anticipate receiving responses to this notice of a non-competitive action. If parties choose to respond, responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency however, any cost associated with the preparation and submission of data or any other costs incurred in response to this announcement are the sole responsibility of the respondent and will not be reimbursed by the Government.

<ARCHDATE>08302009
<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Roseburg Healthcare System, has amended a sole source purchase order to  provide patient transportation services and the full range of paramedic and ambulance services in the local community for beneficiaries of the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMC) in VA ROSEBURG HEALTHCARE SYSTEM to Douglas County Fire District 2.  The awarded purchase order was for a firm fixed price and covered a three month period from April 1, 2009 through June 30, 2009.  It is the Government's belief that only Douglas County Fire District 2 possessed the required capabilities to successfully meet this requirement. Please refer to the Sole Source Justification. This is not a solicitation or a request for information; it is notice of an amendment to a sole source contract award.JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVALVA653-C94149, Modification 002PARAMEDIC AND AMBULANCE SERVICESSOLE SOURCE AWARD1.  Identification of the agency and the contracting activity, and specific identification of the document as a "Justification for other than full and open competition.""	Roseburg VA Healthcare System 913 NW Garden Valley Blvd, Roseburg, OR  974702.  Nature and/or description of the action being approved."	Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition for Ambulance Services.  Modification to the purchase order awarded to Douglas County Fire District 2 for the period of 4/1/09 to 6/30/09, extending services to 9/30/09 and increasing the award.3.  A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value)."	Paramedic and Ambulance Services 4/1/09 to 9/30/09, estimated total value of $205,570.98.4.  An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition."	FAR  6.302-1(b)(1)(i) Services are available from only one source5.  A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited."	Douglas County Fire District 2 is on the only licensed provider in Roseburg and the only one in Douglas County with an extensive fleet of ground transport vehicles.  The other providers in the county have an insufficient number of vehicles to fill the requirements of the Roseburg VA .  6.  A description of the efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies."	Search on GSA eLibrary using search criteria of "Schedule 48 - TRANSPORTATION, DELIVERY AND RELOCATION SOLUTIONS" revealed no contractors in Oregon."	Search on www.abilityone.org revealed that Ability One does not provide these type of services."	Search on vip.vetbiz.gov using NACIS 621910 (Internet Publishing and Broadcasting and Web Search Portals) revealed no vendors in Oregon."	Yellow page listings were reviewed by the Contracting Officer.  "	State of Oregon Department of Licenses, Permits and Registrations was contacted by the Contracting Officer for a listing of licensed providers."	A notification of intent to make a sole source award was publicized in FedBizOpps.  No responses were received.7.  A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable."	The Contracting Officer determined that the price proposed of $205,570.98 was fair and reasonable.8.  A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted."	Market research included checking the yellow pages and contacting the State of Oregon to determine if there were other licensed contractors in the Roseburg area.  As stated in #5, Douglas County Fire District 2 is on the only licensed provider in Roseburg and the only one in Douglas County with an extensive fleet of ground transport vehicles.  The other providers in the county have an insufficient number of vehicles to fill the requirements of the Roseburg VA.9.  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as:	i.  Explanation of why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available.	?   The contracting activity seeks to maximize competition whenever possible.  However, paramedic and ambulance service requirements are very specific and regulated and there is only one responsible source available to meet the Government's needs.  Seeking further competition under these circumstances would serve no useful purpose.	ii.  When 6.302-1 is cited for follow-on acquisitions as described in 6.302-(1)(a)(2)(ii), an estimate of the cost to the Government that would be duplicated and how the estimate was derived.	?  N/A10.  A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.?  None to date11.  A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.?  This acquisition is truly a sole source requirement and there were no barriers to competition to remove.
