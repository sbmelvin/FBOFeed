<SUBJECT>Purchase of Biotage Extrahera
<SOLNBR>RFQ75D301-18-Q-68796
<RESPDATE>072918
<CONTACT>Timothy Williams, Contracting Officer, Phone 7704882791, Email TLWilliams3@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health, Division of Laboratory Sciences (DLS) intends to award a sole source firm-fixed price purchase order to the Biotage, LLC. The address is 10430 Harris Oak Blvd, Suite C, Charlotte, NC 28269-7518. The purpose of this acquisition is to purchase the Biotage Extrahera.
<p>The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is in accordance with FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1).</p>
<p>The NAICS Code for this procurement is 334516 (Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing). The size standard is 1000 employees.</p>
<p>The Government intends to purchase the Biotage Extrahera needed by the Division of Laboratory Sciences (DLS). The Biotage Extrahera will be used in the laboratory to rapidly prepare fentanyl for analysis. <br />The Biotage Extrahera is the only bench-top liquid handling system designed specifically to process Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) in multiple formats (96 well and standalone cartridge) by using positive pressure. It is unique in several different ways. The Biotage Extrahera has the ability to carry out SPE on samples either in 96-well format or cartridge based format. It performs all SPE using positive pressure to move solvent through the extraction bed. Due to the proximity of the SPE outlet to the receiving vessel in a positive pressure system, the chance of cross well/cartridge contamination is greatly reduced when compared to a vacuum style elution. Furthermore, the user has greater control over the positive pressure applied. Resulting in a more uniform extraction. The Biotage Extrahera has the ability to extract defined wells on a 96-well plate (eg partial plate extraction). This feature allows the use of 96-well consumables to be spread out over several analytical runs without compromise. The Biotage Extrahera is fully enclosed and has a ventilated system for safety. The Biotage Extrahera has the ability to utilize five different solvents during an extraction an store bulk quantities of solvent safely on the instrument.</p>
<p>Only Biotage LLC makes the Biotage Extrahera. Biotage LLC specially makes the Biotage Extrahera upon demand to the CDC's exact specifications. The Biotage Extrahera automates sample processing and does it with engineered precision. It is the only liquid handling system on the market that is compatible with the other Biotage Extrahera equipment currently utilized in the Division of Laboratory Sciences.</p>
<p>No solicitation will be posted to FedBizOpps. We will only issue a solicitation to the Biotage LLC. The Biotage LLC is the only source available to provide this service that meets mission critical requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for proposal. A determination to compete this procurement based on response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Interested parties who believe they possess the capability to satisfy this requirement should submit a capability statement demonstrating their ability to meet this requirement. All responses must be sent in writing to Mr. Tim Williams via email to TLWilliams3@cdc.gov using solicitation number 75D301-18-Q-68796 in the subject line, no later than 8:00am Eastern Time, July 29, 2018.</p>

NAVSUP WSS does not possess the necessary engineering drawing masters, developmental specifications, engineering change data, interface specifications, etc. required to source these parts to another vendor other than Lockheed Martin. NAVSUP WSS does not have required Navy technical support activity (TSA) or in-service engineering support approval to parts procured or repaired by sources other than Lockheed Martin. Data is not currently available for competition. Lockheed Martin provided detailed analysis and justification for value-added parts which was reviewed by the AN/UYQ-70(V) host ISEA community. This review was performed to see if parts could be properly broken out without negatively impacting host weapon system certification, configuration management and operating systems. The review revealed that the Government does not possess the in-depth technical knowledge; or the required technical documentation; or it is not up-to-date; or it is incomplete in content for full and open competition. Configuration control of commercial parts is insufficient when purchase from sources other than the Q-70 system integrator. The integrator has the necessary operational, design, configuration management, integration and engineering knowledge when purchasing, building and repairing Q-70 parts for hosted systems. ***SOURCE APPROVAL*** LOCKHEED MARTIN IS CURRENTLY THE ONLY APPROVED SOURCE OF SUPPLY FOR THESE ITEMS.

<DESC>Description:
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes. No award will be made as a result of this notice. The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice. This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>Immune cells are highly dynamic in nature, for example, depending on milieu a CD4 T helper can secrete many cytokines as IFN-g, TNF-a, IL-9 and IL2 after activation. During activation the specific signaling cascades occur and dictate the functional outcome of a cell. With age it has being shown that human accumulate pro-inflammatory signatures. In current study our goal is to characterize the functional capabilities (cytokines) and signaling cascades at single cell levels in human PBMC. To achieve this, high dimension multicolor flowcytometry providing information of 25-26 parameters at single cell level is very instrumental. Staining with antibodies specific for cell specific surface markers will provide identity of cell from mixture of PBMCs, while intracellular cytokines and signaling phospho-protein staining provides a high-resolution information. Also, it has the capacity for rapid analysis of large numbers of cells required.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives:<br /><br />The high parameter flow cytometer is a powerful analytical tool to identify and analyze distinctive phenotypes in heterogeneous populations. These HPS Panel Design Starter kits will allow us to design a high parameter panel and acquire small quantity samples of the corresponding reagents to evaluate the effectiveness of the initial panel design and optimize the panel design through iteration. These panels will allow us to differentiate cells in the PBMC using surface staining. Further, doing intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) and phospho-flow staining for phosphoproteins will achieve functional dynamics of immune cells.</p>
<p>Anticipated period of performance: <br />The period of performance shall be as follows: July 2018 - May 2019</p>
<p>Place of Performance:</p>
<p>The place of performance shall be the National Institute on Aging location at 251 Bayview Boulevard, Baltimore, MD 21224.<br />Salient Characteristics: <br />a. Untouched, viable cells.<br />b. Up to 97% purity.<br />c. Column-free<br />d. Fast and easy to use.<br />e. Unwanted cells are targeted for removal.<br />f. Magnet-base use</p>
<p>Anticipated Contract Type:<br />A Firm Fixed Price Purchase Order is contemplated. The order shall be sourced via the Open Market on a single-source basis and is not expected to exceed $150,000.<br />Capability Statement:</p>
<p>Contractors that believe they possess the ability to provide the required services should submit documentation of their ability to meet each of the project requirements to the Contract Specialist.</p>

<SUBJECT>R--Airborne Magnetic Total-Field Survey Covering South Carolina 
<SOLNBR>140G0218R0043
<CONTACT>Valdez, Robert
<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT: This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE. The U.S. Geological Survey is conducting a MARKET SURVEY to determine the interest and capability of any firm eligible to compete under NAICS code 541360 with a Small Business Size Standard $15.0M for an upcoming requirement for airborne magnetic total-field survey covering South Carolina to provide digitally recorded and processed airborne data. 

THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. ALL COST ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION AS REQUESTED BY THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE SHALL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CONTRACTOR. Submission is voluntary. 

Project Description: The USGS requests airborne radiometric and total-field magnetic data covering parts of South Carolina. Nearby cities include Charleston and Columbia, South Carolina.

A magnetic and radiometric system is required that can image basement structure and lithologic variations, and surface radioelements. The magnetic data are intended for rigorous interpretation of structural trends and 3-D geometry and lithology of basement rocks. It is expected that subtle anomalies will be critical to the ultimate interpretation, requiring low noise data and high resolution. The nominal terrain clearance shall be 80-150 meters, although it is understood that greater terrain clearances may be required in several places.

The goal is to provide high quality airborne magnetic and radiometric data that will be used for geological framework studies, with application to scientific questions regarding earthquake hazards and mineral resources.

The Contractor shall furnish all travel, mobilization, labor, materials, aircraft and aircraft facilities, and demobilization, except as otherwise specified herein, required for conducting a magnetic survey. The contractor shall provide digitally recorded and processed airborne data in accordance with the terms, conditions and specifications set forth in this contract.

The government has a definite requirement for and plans to award a minimum of 4,200 line kilometers (km) with an up to 24,000 optional “add-on” line km pending availability of funds.    

A scope of work will be provided with any solicitation that may be issued. 

Responses to this announcement are requested from (1) SBA certified Small Business HubZone firms; (2) Small Business firms certified by a Small Business Administration (SBA) district or regional office for participation in the 8(a) program; (3) Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned small Business firms; (4) Small Businesses. 

In response to this announcement, please indicate your firm's socioeconomic status (e.g. small business, service-disabled veteran-owned, women owned, HUBZone, etc.)  This information will assist the Government in determining how small businesses can fit into the acquisition strategy.



A firm is considered small under NAICS code 541360 if their AVERAGE annual receipts for the preceding three (3) years were less than or equal to $15.0 million. Any information submitted is voluntary. If sufficient interest and capability is not received from firms in categories (1) through (4) above, any solicitation may be issued as unrestricted without further consideration.

Interested small business firms shall submit (1) NAME, ADDRESS, and PHONE NUMBER OF THE FIRM (including DUNS NUMBER); (2) a CAPABILITY STATEMENT including (a) RECENT (within the last three fiscal years) RELEVANT (similar projects to this requirement) performance history (identify the name of the owner and their point(s) of contact with telephone and fax numbers, e-mail addresses; and (b) in what capacity (e.g., prime, subcontractor etc.) they performed the work; and (3) their SIZE STATUS. 

Your company must have a DUNs number and be registered on-line at the System for Award Management (SAM). You will also be required to provide your small business status information either via the RFP or the On-line Representations and Certifications (ORCA) also located at the SAM website before an award to your company can be made. Your on-line ORCA registration will cover any/all of your offers to the Federal Government, and only needs updated annually.

All responses must be submitted NLT July 19, 2018 at 3:00pm MST via e-mail to: rvaldez@usgs.gov.

This is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP) or Invitation for Bid (IFB) and does not constitute any commitment by the Government. Responses to this sources sought notice will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. All interested sources must respond to future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this market survey. Any solicitation that may be issued will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website and no paper copies will be provided.

Functional/Performance/Specification

The Sterile Processing staff and leadership have determined that the Medline Ergosmart Prep and Pack Tables are the preferred choice because they are the latest ergonomic technology for preparation room workstations. These tables are also electrically height adjustable to accommodate staff standing at workstations for extended periods. Use of non-ergonomic workstations can contribute to work-related employee health issues due to incorrect height placement for individuals. This purchase would allow for more compliance for the health and safety of our employees.

<DESC>1. General Information <br /><br />There is no risk to you for participating in this survey. Participation in this effort is strictly voluntary with no obligation incurred by the United States Government (USG). The USG will in no way be bound to this information if any solicitation is issued. However, this presents an important opportunity for Industry to receive initial requirements information linked to the Robotics and Autonomous Systems (RAS) efforts. Participation in this Industry Day is strictly voluntary and the U.S. Government will not reimburse contractors for any cost incurred for its participation in this event. There is no requirement for any information to be submitted to the Government based on this FBO announcement before Industry Day.<br /><br />2. Purpose<br />Robotics and Autonomous Systems Division, Capabilities Development and Integration Directorate, U.S. Army Maneuver Center of Excellence, herein after referred to as the United States Government (USG), is providing Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) to industry. CUI includes a redacted version of the approved RAS Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) and draft RAS requirements matrix. This information could support the potential acquisition of RAS systems. Given this approach, the USG is providing early access to requirements information to Industry to facilitate possible internal research and development efforts and to gain feedback from industry for system capability refinement. System capabilities include wearable robotics, Artificial Intelligence and machine learning. This notice does not constitute an Invitation to Bid or Request for Proposal, is not to be construed as a solicitation, and no award shall be made on the basis of this notice. There is no formal solicitation available at this time, nor will a solicitation be issued against this notice. This is not a request for information and does not obligate the Government to issue a solicitation. The U.S. Army Maneuver Center of Excellence will host a RAS Industry Day on 30 August 2018 in room W101 at McGinnis Wickam Hall, 1 Karker Street, Fort Benning Georgia 31905. At the RAS Industry Day, the RAS Division will describe the operational context and RAS high level capability needs; Product Director Autonomous Systems will brief the current program plan; and other USG representatives may provide additional information and guidance. In order for your company to attend Industry Day, you must provide an approved and current DD Form 2345 Military Critical Technical Data Agreement along with a by name list of the attendees. Industry will be able to ask general questions during open session 0900-1200, 30 Aug. There will also be one-on-one sessions available 1300-1600, 30 Aug, to discuss specific technologies. If industry wishes to be considered for the limited one-on-one sessions, submit a one page white paper on the proprietary technology to be discussed as part of the registration process - priority will be given to non-traditional industries that do not have a continuing presence at MCoE. Companies will be informed of their selection and if appropriate their time slot by 29 Aug 18. The RAS Industry Day may be followed by a Product/Platform Performance Demonstration (PPD) at a date to be determined. Announcements and invitations to the RAS PPD will also use the FBO process for notification. There may also be Industry days in the future focused on other RAS capabilities.
<p><br />3. Background<br />The RAS ICD was presented to senior Army leaders for approval in early July; final approval is anticipated prior to 30 August.</p>
<p>4. Requesting Controlled Unclassified Information <br />The CUI in the RAS ICD and draft RAS requirements matrix is available to properly vetted, interested domestic and foreign industry participants who want to gain an early understanding of RAS requirements. US and Canadian Companies must have an approved and current DD 2345 Military Critical Technical Data Agreement to receive the RAS ICD and draft RAS requirements matrix. The United States - Canada Joint Certification Program Office is the approver of these forms. For more information, please visit their website https://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/Default.aspx. We will only be providing the CUI to the custodian listed on the DD 2345 form. If your company would like to receive a copy of the RAS ICD and draft RAS requirements matrix, please have the custodian listed on your DD 2345 form send an email request to Mr. Johnny Baker, johnny.l.baker.civ@mail.mil. Your request must contain the following:<br /><br />&bull; Your Company's name and address<br />&bull; Your Name, Title, Office phone number and email address<br />&bull; Copy of the valid/current DD 2345<br /><br />After verification, the RAS ICD and draft RAS requirements matrix will be sent to the Custodian listed on the DD 2345. Also, a RAS Industry Day registration form will be emailed to the Custodian to be completed for the proposed attendees. The USG will respond to requests, normally within five (5) business days. The RAS ICD and draft RAS requirements matrix is currently available for distribution. Please be advised, once your request has been approved, you will automatically receive any updated or additional CUI that becomes available during the duration of this special announcement. We will only be sending registration information to the custodian listed on the DD 2345 form.</p>
<p>Foreign companies must submit their requests via a letter through their Embassy in the United States. Disclosure of the RAS controlled unclassified information will be made on a country by country basis, partially based on the ability of the foreign company to properly safeguard USG CUI. The letter is no more than two pages but should include:<br /><br />A) A request for documentary records and who is requesting.<br />B) The Solicitation number.<br />C) What it is they are requesting and why.<br />D) Embassy Point of Contact with signature/stamp.<br />E) Statement of Sponsorship describing the company's ability to secure the information and the Government's assumption of responsibility.</p>
<p>5. Proprietary Information <br />There is no requirement to submit any information to the USG based on this announcement. However, if comments or concerns are voluntarily submitted, the USG acknowledges its obligations under the Federal Acquisition Regulation 3.104-4 to protect proprietary information provided to the Government (18 U.S.C. &sect;1905). Pursuant to this statute, the USG is willing to accept any trade secrets or proprietary restrictions placed upon qualifying data voluntarily submitted and to protect such information from unauthorized disclosure, subject to the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Qualifying data must be clearly marked PROPRIETARY and be accompanied by an explanatory text so that the Government is clearly notified as to exactly what data so qualifies. <br />&bull; Mark only data that is truly proprietary. <br />&bull; Proprietary data transmitted electronically must have the PROPRIETARY legend on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail as well as at the beginning of the file. Proprietary information contained within the correspondence shall use the legends: "PROPRIETARY PORTION BEGINS" and "PROPRIETARY PORTION ENDS."</p>
<p>Disclaimer. The USG is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Nor is the Government obligated for like data in possession of third parties or for data which is afterwards placed in the public domain by the contractor or by third parties through no fault of the USG. Should the USG need to reproduce the protected data for distribution purposes between Government offices, all such data will be reproduced with restrictive legends in place.</p>
<p>Support Contractors:<br /><br />The Government sometimes uses support contractors in reviewing responses. Consequently, voluntary responses that contain proprietary information may receive only limited or no consideration since the Respondent's marking of data as "PROPRIETARY" will preclude disclosure of same outside the Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort. The USG will use its best efforts to review those voluntary responses that contain proprietary information without using support contractors consistent with the resources available.</p>
<p>6. Submission Schedule<br />There is not a formal submission schedule. There is not a requirement for a formal submission of information to the USG. If a company desires to provide informal submissions, comments, or concerns after receiving the RAS ICD and draft RAS requirements matrix provided based on request to this announcement please contact:</p>
<p>Johnny baker<br />Email Address: johnny.l.baker.civ@mail.mil <br />Or<br />Andrew Vincent<br />Email Address: Andrew.a.vincent.civ@mail.mil</p>
<p>7. Instructions for Responding to this Announcement<br />There is not any requirement for a formal submission of information to the USG.</p>
<p>A. Classified Response: N/A</p>
<p>B. UNCLASS Response: If a company is allowed to submit informal comments or concerns, please send Johnny Baker (johnny.l.baker.civ@mail.mil), and Andrew Vincent (andrew.a.vincent.civ@mail.mil).</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

<DESC>Description:<br />This constitutes a Request for Proposal (RFP), for a new indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) multiple award contract for construction, repair, and alteration, with design-build and incidental abatement services. The General Services Administration (GSA), Public Buildings Service (PBS), Greater Southwest Region 7, Acquisition Management Division is the office soliciting and will administer the resulting contracts.
<p>In accordance with FAR 52.219-6, this procurement is set aside exclusively for Small Business concerns.</p>
<p>Performance Location:<br />Counties and parishes within the states of Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas (Region 7).</p>
<p>General Description of Scope of Services:<br />This contract is to provide general construction, repair, and alteration, with design-build and incidental abatement services. The NAICS code for this procurement is 236220 with a size standard of $36.5 million.</p>
<p>This will be a firm fixed price multiple award contract. This PBS Region has been organized into thirteen geographic zones. Awards will be staggered by zone, potentially two zones at a time. All work to be acquired under the contracts will be accomplished by the issuance of individual task orders. The individual task orders to be placed under the contracts will range in dollar value from approximately $2,000 to $3,500,000; however, project values will NOT be equally spread over this range. The Maximum Order Limitation (MOL) for a contract which is primary in only the Small Projects Pool shall be $1,000,000 aggregate for all task orders for each annual period of performance, for each contract, for each zone. The Maximum Order Limitation (MOL) for a contract which is primary in only the Large Projects Pool shall be $4,000,000 aggregate for all task orders for each annual period of performance, for each contract, for each zone. A contract which is primary in both project pools will have a MOL of $5,000,000 aggregate for all task orders for each annual period of performance, for each contract, for each zone. These contract vehicles may be used by both GSA Regional and Field Office personnel. These contracts will be solicited as one (1) year contracts, with four (4) separate one (1) year option periods, for a total potential contract period not to exceed five (5) years. Facilities covered under the scope of this contract include Government owned and leased facilities in counties or parishes within the states of Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas.</p>
<p>Services will be required under these contracts on an as-needed basis up to a single task order limit of $3,500,000. Task orders will be prepared based on defined scopes of work for specific projects and issued as firm-fixed price tasks orders.</p>
<p>The base IDIQ contracts will be acquired using Source Selection procedures as identified in FAR 15.3 with a firm-fixed price award to the offerors who provide the best value to the Government. Offerors will be evaluated based on technical merit and price proposals. For this procurement, technical evaluation factors, when combined, are significantly more important than total evaluated price. The trade-off process under the best value approach will be used. The technical evaluation factors in descending order of importance are: 1. Past Performance and 2. Hypothetical Projects.</p>
<p>The Government's intent is to award up to six (6) IDIQ contracts per zone, to offerors who submit a proposal which will provide the best value to the Government in terms of technical qualifications and price; however, the Government reserves the right to award more or fewer contracts per zone as determined to be necessary.</p>
<p>The Government intends to make award without discussion. Therefore, offerors are requested to submit their initial proposals to the Government on the most favorable terms based on technical and price factors. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.</p>
<p>The solicitation package (offer forms, attachments, clauses, and provisions) is available only electronically on fbo.gov. Potential offerors are responsible for downloading the solicitation and attachments, and for monitoring the website for possible amendments and/or additional information. A pre-proposal conference will be conducted at the date and time identified in the solicitation package.

All inquiries must be in writing. All answers will be provided in writing and will be available on the aforementioned FBO posting.</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command
