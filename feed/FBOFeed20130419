<DESC>The Air Force Lifecycle Management Center (AFLCMC/LPKPB) at Tinker Air Force Base Oklahoma plan to negotiate a requirements type contract for the acquisition of Interactive Electronic Technical Manuals (IETMs) for USAF engines (F101-102, F110-100, F110-129, F118-100 and TF39).  The requirement will be to provide Block Cycle Updates (BCU's) and sustainment support of IETM technical orders and Portable Document Format (PDF) support for distribution and/or printing along with IETM system improvements and functionalities and future enhancements to the system.  Contract intended to be ONE BASE year with FOUR one year options.  In the event the government has sufficient data at the end of any one year to make future actions competitive, the option years will not be utilized.  This is a sole source acquisition and award will be conducted and evaluated under the provisions of FAR Part 15.  The responsible offeror must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications (ORCA)database (available at http?//orca.bpn.gov/) and submit a completed copy with their quote.  The offeror must also be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) Database (available at www.sam.gov).  Lack of registration in SAM will qualify contractor as ineligible for award.  Authority:  10 U.S.C. 2304(C)(1), Justification:  Services required are available from only one responsible source and no other type of services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contraction action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit a proposal.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within 45 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The Government does NOT own the data or the rights to the data needed to purchase this requirement.

Courtade, (586) 282.9748 or e-mail at brendon.m.courtade.civ@mail.mil. <br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Additionally, the Government seeks to collect data from companies interested in this requirement.  If your company is interested in this procurement, please provide a response to the contract specialist, Mr. Brendon Courtade at Brendon.m.courtade.civ@mail.mil no later than 20 Sep 2012.  NOTE: These responses are voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to the sources survey and any follow-on information requests.  Responses are NOT required to bid on any future solicitation.  See below:<br><br>GENERAL INFORMATION: The U.S. Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this survey. The U.S. Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C.  1905 to protect information qualifying as "confidential" under this statute. [To avoid possible confusion with the meaning of the term "confidential" in the context of Classified Information," we will use the term "PROPRIETARY."] Pursuant to this statute, the U.S. Government is willing to accept any trade secret or PROPRIETARY restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following: <br><br>1. Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data with the restrictive legend (all caps) "PROPRIETARY" with any explanatory text, so that the U.S. Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected. <br><br>2.   In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly confidential (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as "PROPRIETARY" may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected. <br><br>3.  The U.S. Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the U.S. Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the U.S. Government will not be protected once in the public domain. Data already in the possession of the U.S. Government will be protected in accordance with the U.S. Government's rights in the data. <br><br>4.  Confidential data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the U.S. Government, shall contain the "PROPRIETARY" legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself. Where appropriate for only portions of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends 'PROPRIETARY PORTION BEGINS:" and "PROPRIETARY PORTION ENDS." <br><br>5.  In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the U.S. Government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text. <br><br>6. The U.S. Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses that contain confidential information may receive only limited or no consideration since the Respondent's marking of data as "PROPRIETARY" will preclude disclosure of same outside the U.S. Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort. The U.S. Government will use its best efforts to evaluate those responses that contain confidential information without using support contractors consistent with the resources available. <br><br>INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THE QUESTIONNAIRE:<br> <br>1.  Number each response with the appropriate question number.<br><br>2. You do not have to repeat the question in your response. <br><br>3. If you cannot answer the question, please indicate "No Response."<br><br>4. If a response will satisfy another question, state: "See response to question XX." <br><br>5. Include relevant sales media and product manuals. If providing an ACROBAT formatted manual, annotate the manual to indicate which material is applicable to the questions. If preferred, include Internet Web links to locations where animations/videos may be viewed. <br><br>6. If your sales media and/or manuals contain a restricted distribution statement, issue a release statement indicating that the restricted material may be distributed to Army personnel involved with this Sources Survey. <br><br>7. Spell out any acronyms in their first instance. <br><br>8. Clearly mark any confidential information. If applicable the front page of your response package should state "Confidential Information Contained." <br><br>Provide a release statement indicating that the confidential information may distributed to Army personnel involved with this Market Survey. <br><br>A.

<CONTACT>Leslie D. Jones, Contract Specialist, Phone 7704882042, Email jxy6@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), intends to award a sole source Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to the National Environmental Health Association (NEHA) located at 720 S. Colorado Boulevard, Suite 1000N, Denver, CO 80246-1904 for the acquisition of National Environmental Health Training Services. The period of performance for this procurement is 60 months with a contract ceiling amount of $12M. Task orders issued under the contract shall be issued on a firm-fixed price basis. <br /><br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1(a) - only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 611710, Educational Support Services, with a size standard of $14M.<br /><br />The purpose of this acquisition is to train current environmental public health professionals and prepare them for accreditation in the area of environmental health. The accreditation of local health departments is a key objective for CDC in improving public health practice in the United States. Environmental health is an important component of public health. In order to meet the goals established by CDC in the "Healthy People 2020" document and the "Public Health Workforce 21st Century Agenda", CDC must establish certification standards to ensure that the environmental health practitioners have the technical competencies and skill sets necessary to do their jobs. Therefore, CDC is required to have an environmental health training curriculum in place to teach the core competencies necessary for successful environmental health practice. <br /><br />NEHA is only known organization capable of providing the nationally recognized professional credentials needed to train environmental health practitioners. The environmental health educational and certification services required for this acquisition are highly complex and diverse. The contractor is required to have the capability to do professional credentialing and/or certification for environmental health professionals in the following programs: Registered Environmental Health Specialist/Registered Sanitarian (REHS/RS); Certified Installer of Onsite Wastewater Treatment Systems (CIOWTS); Healthy Homes Specialist Credential (HHS); Certified Professional - Food Safety (CP-FS); Certified Environmental Health Technician (CEHT); Registered Environmental Technician (RET); Registered Hazardous Substances Professional (RHSP); Registered Hazardous Substances Specialist (RHSS) and NEHA's National Radon Proficiency Program. NEHA solely has nationally recognized credentials and certifications to meet the requirements of this acquisition. Additionally, NEHA is widely recognized within the profession among environmental health practitioners as the benchmark standard for training environmental health personnel.<br /><br />Environmental health is a diverse multi-disciplinary field. NEHA can provide these unique services in a timely and efficient manner. In order to have a viable mechanism that meets CDC's need to test for and certify environmental health workforce skills, the contractor must have the immediate capacity to offer certification through a professional credential that can furthermore link all the skills and knowledge necessary for that credential specifically to the training curriculum. NEHA has a fully developed program that can be immediately utilized in support of the Government's requirements.<br />&nbsp;
<p>The REHS/RS credential is unique. It is the only environmental health credential in the United States that tests for and certifies competence in the vast array of disciplines that comprise environmental health. The practice of environmental health requires a knowledge base involving a large range of possible adverse environmental exposures that occur in air, land, and water. Moreover, the detection and prevention of these adverse effects in a human population can vary depending on the type of exposure and the environmental media that carries the contaminate. This makes having the REHS/RS credential essential when training and testing environmental health professionals and certifying the knowledge, skills and competencies they possess to insure quality programs and practice. NEHA is the only organization that can provide the REHS/RS credential.</p>
<p>A credential signifies that an environmental health practitioner has mastered a body of knowledge and has acquired sufficient skills and experience to competently perform work in the environmental health field. NEHA's extensive environmental health training program and credentialing program has as its cornerstone this nationally recognized REHS/RS credential. The process of developing, validating, and maintaining this type of credential is very complex and time consuming. There is no other professional organization that could develop or provide a comparable credential within the time frame that it is needed to meet CDC's requirements. NEHA has a fully developed program that can be immediately utilized in support of this program.</p>
<p>NEHA's ability to immediately provide this credentialing capability in all of the education and training services required for this acquisition will assure CDC of its ability to meet its workforce training goals. Meeting these workforce training goals is critical in assuring the timely implementation of the larger local health department accreditation effort. The continuity NEHA provides with their credentialing programs to the practitioners in the field of environmental health will substantially increase their capacity to respond to intentional and unintentional outbreaks of environmental public health related illness and disease. It is through the device of a credential that a community gains assurance that the workforce handling this responsibility is competent, properly trained, and equipped to carry out their responsibilities. Nationally recognized in scope, NEHA's credential program validates their understanding of this as well as their specialized knowledge and skill related to environmental public health and prevention.<br /><br />As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to the National Environmental Health Association (NEHA). However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide the services to Leslie Jones via email ONLY at jxy6@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 2013-N-15035 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN May 4, 2013.<br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC><p>1. Federal Student Aid (FSA), a component of the Department of Education (DoED), continues to advance its Enterprise Identity Management Solution (EIMS) initiative, under which it has been engaged in systematically upgrading legacy capabilities external users' interface with to access FSA data and evolving its security approach to ensure all of its security capabilities interoperate and function as a unified enterprise asset. Collectively, these actions are designed to better protect external users, along with FSA systems and data.</p>
<p>2. The next phase of the EIMS initiative involves replacing the PIN application, which non-privileged users interface with to register and access their data, with an enhanced solution that either gets integrated into the existing FSA Access Identity Management System (AIMS) or an AIMS equivalent alternative capability that can effectively interoperate with AIMS. Except for Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) software usage rights and related maintenance services, which FSA acquires directly, and hosting which FSA currently buys as a service, the provider of the next phase will provide all other solution components. However, in terms of hosting, the solution provider may optionally propose an alternative hosting source. During subsequent EIMS phases, FSA anticipates acquiring enhancements to its PM application, which privileged users interface with to access FSA data and deploying added factors, using soft tokens or other technologies, to all FSA external users. Refer to the attached SOO for added details regarding the upcoming procurement for the ongoing EIMS initiative.</p>
<p>3. This ADVANCE NOTICE is being made to advise INTERESTED SMALL BUSINESS (SB) SOURCES, that FSA currently INTENDS to procure the next phase of the EIMS initiative, i.e., the PIN system replacement solution integrated into AIMS or an alternate AIMS equivalent capability, as a SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE ACTION. Also, to give interested SBs and other entities added time to reflect on this upcoming business opportunity, provide comments and submit any clarifying questions deemed relevant. The goal is to ensure the follow-on requests for proposal (RFP) is high quality and problem-free.</p>
<p>4. As indicated, FSA intends to compete this requirement, as an SB set-aside action and to conduct a TWO-STEP PROCUREMENT PROCESS. Phase 1 will involve FSA releasing, on or before 3 May 2013, an RFP to obtain proposal inputs from interested SB entities about organizational and managerial capabilities, characteristics and approach. Also, a proposed technical solution, presented in a clear and concise format; and reference contact information for clients, preferably governmental, that the provider has successful developed and deployed solutions similar in scope, magnitude and complexity. After evaluating these submissions, against evaluation criteria stated in the RFP, FSA will select those providers it determines are most qualified to continue into Phase 2, during which another RFP will be released requiring more detailed proposal inputs in technical solution, pricing and possibly other areas. Also, the RFP will contain different evaluation criteria and selection will be the result of an FSA &lsquo;best value' determination based on it conducting a tradeoff analysis. Please note, recognizing proposals require resources, this two-step approach is intended as a form of acquisition streamlining, so only those entities deemed most qualified may have to incur greater proposal investment.</p>
<p>5. FSA intends to execute this procurement action using FAR Part 12, commercial contracting methods, combined with FAR Par 15, competitive negotiation procedures. FSA recognizes interested SBs may choose to subcontract portions of this work to other business entities, which is acceptable, however any work subcontracted to other than a small businesses must, in total, be less than 50% of total costs. Also, interested SBs may choose to propose an AIMS equivalent alternative, which as stated, if such a solution was selected, at minimum, the COTS and related maintenance components would be acquired directly by FSA.</p>
<p>6. The Phase 1 RFP will most likely require a rough order of magnitude (ROM) price estimated for the proposed solution. The Phase 2 RFP will require sufficiently detailed pricing information consistent with and within the ROM submitted in Phase 1.</p>
<p>7. Feedback, clarification questions and other types of queries about this advance notice or related requirement shall be submitted, via email, to Tracy Pope at tracy.pope@ed.gov through 12:00 pm (noon) on 23 April 2013 and include Richard Segich at Richard.Segich@ed.gov and Carolyn Dickens at Carolyn.Dickens@ed.gov as a &lsquo;cc'. Please note, this input should NOT be about seeking more specific details, that would otherwise be included in the Phase 1 RFP, but instead focused on helping FSA ensure the Phase 1 RFP is high quality and problem-free.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&amp;D) NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.<br /><br />The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) will be competing a contract for a qualified source for an Asthma Cohort Support Contract. The proposed research study aims to increase understanding of factors that predict poor asthma control during pregnancy as well as add knowledge of the basic immunology as it relates to pregnancy. Asthma is a common chronic disease and some women experience exacerbation and worsening of their asthma during pregnancy while others improve.
<p>This study will be an observational cohort study to evaluate predictors of asthma control variability during pregnancy, including accounting for changes in lung function and markers of inflammation associated with pregnancy in non-asthmatics.</p>
<p>This RFP (NIH-NICHD-DESPR-2013-14) will be electronically available on or about May 7, 2013. Proposals will be due by 3:00 P.M. EST on June 12, 2013. The RFP may be accessed through the FedBizOpps website, https://www.fbo.gov. All responsible sources may submit proposals. This is not a request for proposals. This requirement is defined as code 541712 under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).</p>

<DESC><p>The National Eye Institute (NEI) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to solicit a contract with The Emmes Corporation of Rockville, Maryland. This contract is a follow-on to The Age Related Eye Study II (AREDS II or AREDS 2) contract (N01-EY-5-0007). The purpose of this follow-on contract is to: 1) assist the NEI to use the AREDS II cohort to examine the effects of long-term supplementation with the AREDS II supplements (lutein/zeaxanthin and omega-3 fatty acids) on general and ocular health for 5.5 years after the termination of the AREDS II Clinical trial; and 2) examine the molecular genetics of age-related eye diseases (with possible associations of study nutrients). This is a unique scientific opportunity to take advantage of an established epidemiologic cohort on which extensive data has been obtained. This opportunity also takes advantage of the research study management infrastructure, such as specialized data entry, quality control, and data management systems developed to support the data collected in the study, already developed in the existing contract (N01-EY-5-0007).</p>
<p>The anticipated period of performance is July 1, 2013 through June 30, 2014. The anticipated contract will comprise one (1), one-year base period and four (4), one-year option periods each of which may be exercised unilaterally by the Government for a potential period of performance of 60 months.</p>
<p>Authority: 41 U.S.C. 2539(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1. Inherent duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition makes competition unfeasible for this solicitation.</p>
<p>This is not a request for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations and does not commit the Government to any contractual agreement. A Sources Sought Notice, including a draft Statement of Work, had been posted as HHSNIHODSBSS13005 on April 2, 2013.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.</p>

<DESC>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Research Triangle Park, NC is responsible for procuring, testing, and distributing filters of high purity to the State and Local air pollution control agencies.  The agency has a requirement for glass fiber and quartz filters.  The quartz filters are used with a Size Selective Sampler (SSI) to collect PM-10 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers) samples.  The glass fiber filters are used with a Total Suspended Particulate (TSP) sampler.  Upon receipt of the filters from the contractor, they undergo an acceptance testing process.  This process assures filters with uniform characteristics and known quality assurance testing for the national particulate networks.
The filters for a specific year must be made from the same lot of raw materials for distribution.  It is important that all filters of the same type from the same delivery contain a uniform level of impurities.  Therefore, the contractor shall manufacture all filters for a delivery from the same sheet material using a single production line and one production run.

<DESC>Development of circuitry for improved LED turn-on and turn-off <br>  <br>  <br> Need:  A driver for LEDs is sought that significantly improves the turn-on (rise time) and turn-off (fall time) of a pulsed illumination system. The initial intent is to determine if significant improvements over an existing system are possible. A scalable system where multiple LEDs can be combined into an LED module (luminaire) and/or multiple LED modules operated by a driver circuit and/or multiple driver circuitss controlled by a single external system is of ultimate interest. <br>  <br> The goal of this RFI is to identify candidate sources for a driver circuit that can provide turn-on and turn-off times significantly faster than 200 nanoseconds when operated under load conditions associated with driving LEDs with a forward voltage of 3.5 volts or greater.  <br>  <br> Key parameter: <br> The key parameter is the turn-off time of the driver. Using a definition for turn-off time as the time for output signal to decay from 90% to 10% of the  quote mark on quote mark  state (or a similar definition), a turn-off time of substantially less than 200 nanoseconds must be demonstrated. <br>  <br> Specifications of system: <br>  	LED turn-on and turn-off are to be controlled by 5 volt TTL pulses which will be supplied externally. The hardware and software for generating and supplying the TTL signal are not part of this RFI. <br>  	The driver circuitry must provide synchronized pulsing of multiple LEDs. <br>  	Operational environment is conditioned indoor (18  to 27 C; 5% to 60% RH). <br>  	Adequate heat dissipation for operation under the performance specifications must be considered. <br>  	When considering the physical size and configuration, the design must allow for scalability through the arrangement of multiple (possibly a dozen or more) LED modules assembled in a 2-D or 3-D array which can be several feet in each dimension and simultaneously driven by one or multiple synchronized drivers. As such, driver performance must be consistent and repeatable within a tight tolerance. <br>  <br> Performance Specifications: <br> 	Parameter	Threshold	Objective	Relative Importance <br> 1	Turn-off time	  40 ns	  20 ns	Critical factor <br> 2	Turn-on time	  40 ns	  20 ns	Critical factor <br> 3	Frequency range	10 Hz to 100 kHza	10 Hz up to 2 MHza	Important factor <br> 4	Pulse Width	200ns to .05 S	50 ns to .05 S	Important factor <br> 5	Pulse Width	Continuously on at reduced power level	Continuously on at full power level	 <br> 5	LED Forward voltage 	3.5 V	3.5 V	Important factor <br> 6	Max current output of driver	700 mA per LED	1200 mA per LED	Important factor <br> Notes: <br> a TTL signal supplied externally by existing system <br>  <br>  <br> Interested parties must provide oscillographs demonstrating the accomplishment of the critical factors of having designed a circuit which provides the necessary switching speeds as identified in the Performance Specification rows 1 and 2.  The amount of current being controlled by the circuit, as well as the type of load to include part type and part number and manufacturer must be provided.  Responders must also include the circuit diagram, and are encouraged to submit any other information that supports their accomplishment of having fabricated an electronic system that could meet components of the specification <br>

<DESC>The vendor is to provide a new monitoring system to the insisting system that will allow for equipment standardization in Cardiology.. EnSite Velocity: Cardiac  Mapping System advanced electrophysiology mapping system creates non fluoroscopic 3D images of the heart chambers through the use of either EnSite NavX Visulization and Navigation Technology or the non-contact EnSite Array catheter. System provides diagnostic and interventional capabilities which represent the anatomy of the cardiac chamber and electro anatomical information (e.g. activation maps, voltage maps) as well as tracks the real time location of electrophysiology catheters within the cardiac structure. System also assists in recording the location of ablation lesions as applied by an ablation generator. 

Displays workstation with quad dual core processors running most current version of operating system software. Includes high definition, 24" widescreen monitor for physician viewing, mobile cart, printer, monitor stand, fiber optic cables, amplifier subsystem, 128 channel amplifier, interface module, medical ablation generator, interface module, Navlink module, Arraylink module, Cathlink module, mobile cart, rail clamps, and cables Standardization between units increases the effectiveness of clinical training and reduces use errors leading to increased  patient safety.

Limitations imposed by the present Ensite Velocity Cardiac Mapping System equipment will inevitably result in the inability to schedule an expanded case load and result in case cancellations, when the appropriate system is not available for a scheduled case. Non-availability of the equipment would result in a backlog of patients, cancellation of cases, and much greater cost to the facility to fee basis services.

Acquisition will include the purchase of software, hardware, and implementation services required for the installation of the EnSite Velocity Cardiac Mapping System in the Cardiac Cath Lab. For additional details, reference provided vendor quote.

<DESC>STATISTICAL PROCESSES INVOLVING DEPLOYMENT-RELATED EPIDEMIOLOGICAL RESEARCH (SPIDER)

THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND DOES NOT COMMIT NAVAL MEDICAL LOGISTICS COMMAND TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE.

This is a Sources Sought Notice to determine the availability of Small Businesses capable in providing research support services for conducting and coordinating epidemiological studies to investigate the (a) longitudinal health outcomes of military personnel and their families and (b) the impact of military experiences including deployments. This notice is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, Request for Proposals or Request for Quotation, or an indication the Government will contract for the services described herein.
 This notice is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this notice. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541712, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology), and the size standard is 500 employees. The Naval Medical Logistics Command (NMLC) is seeking to identify sources that can provide the services as described in this notice.

Background

The Naval Health Research Center (NHRC) was designated as the United States Department of Defense (DoD) Center for Deployment Health Research, 30 September 1999, by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs (ASD(HA)).
  To assist in this mission, NHRC established the Deployment Health Research Department (Code 164).  The mission of Department 164 includes conducting epidemiological studies on the health of service members and their families.  An experienced department staff and flexible framework provide the ability to quickly adapt and confront novel health concerns of military, veteran, and DoD beneficiary populations and, where applicable, the general public.  Department 164 has varied expertise in biostatistics, epidemiology, medicine, psychology, reproductive health, complex data management, large mail and telephone surveys, and occupational health.  Currently, Department 164 has several major research studies in progress including its core program, the Millennium Cohort Study, the largest prospective health project in military history, which will evaluate the long-term health effects of military service and deployments among approximately 200,000 US military personnel for up to 75 years.
  

Scope of Work

The contractor will provide research support services for conducting and coordinating epidemiological studies to investigate the (a) longitudinal health outcomes of military personnel and their families and (b) the impact of military experiences including deployments.  Research includes studies of symptoms, hospitalization, reproductive outcomes, mortality, vaccinations, and other health related outcomes among DoD beneficiary populations, both military and civilian.  Research activities will have a large emphasis on statistical analysis, data handling and storage; the creation and maintenance of large DoD health databases and survey-based methodologies.  

Project Objectives

The Deployment Health Research Department (Department 164) at NHRC conducts epidemiological studies to investigate the longitudinal health outcomes of military personnel and their families, and the impact of military experiences including deployments.
  Included among the Department 164 core programs are the Millennium Cohort Study, Millennium Cohort Family Study, the Birth and Infant Health Registry, the Recruit Assessment Program, and other deployment and vaccine related studies within the department.  
  
Other Pertinent Information

The expectation is that this would be an single-award, incrementally-funded, Cost-Plus Fixed-Fee (CPFF), Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract because the service is directed toward objectives for which the work cannot be precisely described in advance.  This requirement addresses an indeterminate amount of data to be processed and analyzed.  The Offeror shall already be approved for performance on a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee contract.
  

A security clearance is not required; however, on-site contractor personnel would be expected to have a favorable adjudication of the results of a background investigation and to comply with any on-site security requirements that may be needed for base access and/or Common Access Card (CAC) processing.

This effort is not considered a new requirement; therefore non-management incumbent employees right of first refusal of positions with the successful offeror is relevant to this contract.

The expectation is that this will be an 80,000-hour (more or less) effort for a 12 month base period of performance.  It is also anticipated that an 80,000 hour (more or less) effort is required for each of the four, 12 month optional periods proceeding execution.
  Before contractor burdens, Other Direct Costs are estimated at $400,000 per year and travel at $50,000 per year, with a negotiated escalation applied annually to direct labor.  

The vast majority of the effort under this contract will be performed on a Government installation, the Naval Health Research Center (NHRC) in San Diego, CA. 

Capability Statement Submission

Parties submitting capability statements shall be advised that generic capability statements are not sufficient for effective evaluation of respondents' capacity and capability of providing the required services. Respondents should limit their capability statements to no more than ten (10) pages in length, excluding standard brochures, technical literature and any other information that demonstrates the capabilities of the contractor to meet the Government's requirement.
 Provide two contact names, email and phone numbers for similar projects that may be contacted by the Government. Potential contractors must indicate business size, proof of any set-aside certification and company's DUNS number and provide a contact name with the mailing address, phone number, email address of that contact. Identification of any applicable GSA contract number, schedule number, SIN number that may be applicable to this potential requirement are also requested.

Interested parties must respond by submitting capability statements to NMLC-Research@med.navy.mil, with the subject titled SPIDER Sources Sought Response on or before April 29, 2013 by 1:00 PM Eastern Time.

<p>Description of Services/Supplies: Therapeutic Equivalence of Generic Iron Complex Product</p>
<p>CONTRACTING OFFICE<br />U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Food and Drug Administration Agency (FDA) / Office of Acquisitions and Grants Services (OAGS)</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION <br />This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of small businesses (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, and HUBZone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses) to evaluate the therapeutic equivalence of generic sodium ferric gluconate iron complex Nulecit<sup>TM</sup> and its RLD Ferrlecit&reg;.</p>
<p>The Contractor's capability statement shall demonstrate the company's ability to meet the following requirements. Please provide a detailed description of your company's (including its teammates, if applicable) experience and demonstrated abilities to deliver the following: <br />Background:<br /><br />Parenteral iron injection products are used to treat anemia, particularly in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). There are four types of parenteral iron complex products available in North America: iron sucrose, sodium ferric gluconate, iron dextran, and ferumoxytol. All parenteral iron products are colloids comprising a continuous aqueous medium and particles of carbohydrate protected iron oxyhydroxide. <br /><br />After intravenous administration, iron colloid particles are processed by phagocytes and iron ions are delivered to the lysosomes within the cell as part of the intracellular labile iron pool. The phagocyte uptake and biodistribution of iron complex particles depend upon their physicochemical properties. If iron is not needed immediately, it is stored in the form of ferritin or hemosiderin. When the iron is needed in the body, iron is released from the cell and transferrin binds iron ions and delivers them to their destination. If transferrin is oversaturated or if the iron complex product is so unstable that iron is spontaneously released at a rate that exceeds transferrin binding capacity, non-transferrin bound iron (NTBI) is formed in the plasma. NTBI can be toxic to cells as it acts as a catalyst in the formation of free radicals from reactive oxygen species. <br /><br />In 2011, FDA approved the first generic sodium ferric gluconate iron complex Nulecit<sup>TM</sup>, an alternative to Ferrlecit&reg; for the treatment of iron deficiency in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. The approval standards for generic iron complex products have been controversial. FDA approved sodium ferric gluconate iron complex based on comprehensive physicochemical characterization and clinical plasma pharmacokinetics data whereas European Medicine Agency (EMA) required additional comparative data from non-clinical studies on the time-dependent iron content in the major target to support the sameness of generic and reference iron complex products. Furthermore, since NTBI is not required for measurement in bioequivalence study in US, concerns have been raised regarding generic iron formulations which may have different levels of labile iron, leading to the formation of different amount of NTBI in vivo from those of reference listed drug (RLD). These NTBIs will potentiate oxidative stress and inflammation, then resulting in direct cellular damage and possibly increasing the risk of atherosclerotic disease.</p>
<p>The Agency believes that a battery of physicochemical characterization tests including in-vitro labile iron determination would ensure comparable tissue distribution and no more in vivo labile iron leakage from generic formulations than that from RLD. Well controlled, prospective studies that investigate iron tissue distribution in preclinical species and compare NTBI levels between brand and generic in hemodialysis patients may confirm the agency's approved criteria and help address the public concerns.<br />Statement of Work (SOW) or Objectives:</p>
<p>The objectives of this requirement is to evaluate the therapeutic equivalence of generic sodium ferric gluconate iron complex Nulecit<sup>TM</sup> and its RLD Ferrlecit&reg;. Specific aims are: 1) compare reticuloendothelial system (RES) uptake of RLD and generic; 2) compare biodistribution of the RLD and generic in animal models; 3) conduct in-vivo study to compare plasma NTBI levels and oxidative stress after i.v. administration of RLD and generic in healthy subjects or patients. This study is part of post-market surveillance that can help address potential concerns regarding the quality of generic iron complex products and support the Agency's review standards.</p>
<p>Below are the detailed descriptions:</p>
<p>1) Conduct in-vitro phagocytosis assays to compare RES uptake of RLD and generic. Since a battery of in vitro characterization tests have proved physicochemical equivalence between Nulecit<sup>TM</sup> and its RLD Ferrlecit&reg;, the rate and extent of phagocyte uptake of generic and RLD should be similar.<br />2) Determine the time-dependent iron content in the major target organ (e.g., plasma, RES, target tissues) and compare biodistribution of RLD and generic in appropriate animal models. Time points for sampling of target tissues should be selected to cover the main time-concentration profiles. <br />3) Conduct a prospective, randomized, 2-way crossover study to compare plasma NTBI levels in hemodialysis patients treated with generic and RLD (healthy control can be used). Utilize in vitro and in vivo biomarkers such as malondialdehyde, heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1) RNA or others to evaluate the oxidative stress and toxicity caused by generic and RLD.</p>
<p>Statistical analyses will be conducted to determine whether there are any significant differences between generic and RLD in the above tests.</p>
<p>This is a 3-year project. Due to the sequential nature of in vivo pharmacokinetic studies, this project is non-severable.</p>
<p>Interested small business potential offerors are encouraged to respond to this notice.

<SUBJECT>Sources Sought for a Study to Investigate the Sensitivity of Pharmacokinetics in Detecting Differences Physicochemical Properties
<SOLNBR>FDA-SS-1116092
<RESPDATE>042913
<CONTACT>Tomeka Evans, Contract Specialist, Phone 3018277168, Email Tomeka.Evans@fda.hhs.gov - Gina Jackson, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-827-7181, Email gina.jackson@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC><p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of small businesses (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, and HUBZone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses) to investigate the sensitivity of pharmacokinetics in detecting differences in physicochemical properties of the active in suspension nasal products for local action.</p>
<p>The Contractor's capability statement shall demonstrate the company's ability to meet the following requirements. Please provide a detailed description of your company's (including its teammates, if applicable) experience and demonstrated abilities to deliver the following:</p>
<p>3.1. Background</p>
<p>At this time, for nasal suspension products intended for local action, the agency recommends that the bioequivalence (BE) be established based on a battery of in-vitro tests to establish equivalent drug delivery to nasal sites of action, pharmacokinetic (PK) studies to establish equivalent systemic exposure, and clinical endpoint studies to establish equivalent efficacy; whereas BE for nasal solution products for local action relies on establishing equivalence in in-vitro tests only. These additional in-vivo study requirements for nasal suspension products stems from the assumption that drug delivery to nasal site of action is dependent on several factors including, but not limited, drug particle size distribution (PSD). Unfortunately, at this time, there is no method that can adequately characterize drug PSD in nasal suspension products. Therefore, to establish equivalent efficacy of nasal suspension products, the agency has to rely on clinical endpoint studies, which are inherently highly variable and insensitive to dose differences.</p>
<p>Drug PSD has the potential to influence both the rate as well as extent of drug availability to nasal sites of action and hence systemic circulation; assuming bioavailability through the gut is very low to negligible (Daley-Yates and Baker, 2001). Therefore, if systemic levels of the drug can be shown to be directly related to drug PSD; systemic PK studies could potentially be used to replace the clinical endpoint study as a surrogate indicator for equivalent drug delivery for nasal suspension products.</p>
<p>3.2. Objectives</p>
<p>The project will investigate the effect of physicochemical properties of the drug in suspension nasal drug product for local action including, but not limited to, particle size, morphic form and solvation state on the pharmacokinetic behavior of the drug product.</p>
<p>3.3. Detailed Description</p>
<p>Nasal suspension spray(s), containing poorly soluble drug intended for local acting in the nose, e.g., fluticasone furoate or mometasone furoate, will be developed and manufactured for this research, under cGMP.</p>
<p>This study will comprise of two phases:</p>
<p>1. Nasal suspension products will be formulated using different batches of the active with different PSDs, morphic form and solvation states, and characterized for their in-vitro performance (e.g., spray pattern, plume geometry) as recommended in the Nasal BA BE guidance.<br /><br />2. A comparative in-vivo PK study will be conducted using a crossover study design to assess the differences in the plasma concentration vs. time profile of the selected nasal suspension products.</p>
<p>Duration of Project</p>
<p>This is a 2-year project. Due to the sequential nature of the in-vitro and pharmacokinetic studies, this project is non-severable.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice shall be limited to 5 pages, and must include:<br /><br />1. Company name, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone and FAX numbers, website address (if available), and the name, telephone number, and e-mail address of a point of contact having the authority and knowledge to clarify responses with Government representatives.<br /><br />2. Name, title, telephone number, and e-mail addresses of individuals who can verify the demonstrated capabilities identified in the responses.<br /><br />3. Business size for NAICS 541712 (size standard $ or number of employees) and status, if qualified as an 8(a) firm (must be certified by SBA), Small Disadvantaged Business (must be certified by SBA), Woman-Owned Small Business, HUBZone firm (must be certified by SBA), and/or Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (must be listed in the VetBiz Vendor Information Pages).<br /><br />4. DUNS number, CAGE Code, Tax Identification Number, and company structure (Corporation, LLC, partnership, joint venture, etc.). Companies also must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) to be considered as potential sources.<br /><br />5. If applicable, identification of the firm's GSA Schedule contract(s) by Schedule number and contract number and SINs that are applicable to this potential requirement are also requested.<br /><br />6. If the company has a Government approved accounting system, please identify the agency that approved the system.<br />Please submit copies of any documentation such as letters or certificates to indicate the firm's status (see item #3, above).</p>
<p>Teaming arrangements are acceptable, and the information required above on the company responding to this announcement, should also be provided for each entity expected to be teammates of the respondent for performance of this work.</p>
<p>To the maximum extent possible, please submit non-proprietary information. Any proprietary information submitted should be identified as such and will be properly protected from disclosure.</p>

<a href="mailto:Cynthia.l.white@nasa.gov">Cynthia L White</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI-2). NASA/GSFC is soliciting information in preparation for the competition of the Rapid Spacecraft Acquisition (RSA) follow-on. Previously known as Rapid III (Rapid 3), the new procurement will be referred to as Rapid IV (Rapid 4). The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) is seeking capability statements from all interested parties, including Small, Small Disadvantaged (SDB), 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Veteran Owned (VOSB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned (SD-VOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) businesses, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)/Minority Institutes (MI) for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small business subcontracting goals for the Rapid IV catalog contract to procure spacecraft designs that comply with mission requirements.	The Government reserves the right to consider a Small, 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Service Disabled Veteran (SD-VOSB), or HUBZone business set-aside based responses hereto. The GSFC requirements include the following: The Rapid IV acquisition will be procured under Far Part 15 and will include the NASA/GSFC Mission Assurance Requirements (MAR) at the Master contract level. The Rapid IV acquisition is intended to result in the award of multiple fixed-priced, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for spacecraft bus core systems that would be used to meet the Governments science and technology needs. Under the RSA process, contracts are awarded to vendors based on their ability to meet specific criteria (for example: the ability to carry out the Statement of Work (SOW); and a heritage spacecraft which has successfully completed on-orbit checkout and acceptance). Vendors would submit core spacecraft designs that could be successfully modified as carriers for one or more flight instrument payloads. Each core spacecraft system would need to supply all necessary design, fabrication, assembly, test, flight payload instrument integration and test, final observatory (spacecraft plus payload) integration and test, shipping, launch support, on-orbit check-out and operations support. Operations support would include all required ground support equipment as well as associated flight and ground based software and software maintenance for the spacecraft offered. Purpose of this RFI: The primary purpose of this RFI is to gather information, comments and suggestions from spacecraft manufacturers regarding: a. Potential offerors. b. Estimated number and type of potential spacecraft offerings. c. Vendors having the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements are invited to submit appropriate documentation, literature, brochures, and references.  The information provided to the Government in response to this RFI will be used to develop the terms and conditions of the upcoming solicitation. GSFC welcomes any information submitted by interested parties in response to this request. Background: The RSA contract serves as a fast and flexible Government-wide, firm fixed priced (FFP), IDIQ procurement tool for flight proven spacecraft or spacecraft components. The RSA contract is managed by the Rapid Spacecraft Development Office (RSDO). The RSDO also facilitates mission-specific spacecraft procurements for government customers via the RSA contract. The purpose of the RSA concept is to reduce overall procurement time, as well as reduce mission implementation cost and risk by leveraging flight proven spacecraft designs. The spacecraft under contract are placed in the RSA catalog for possible procurement via IDIQ delivery orders for mission customers. These mission-specific delivery orders are competed amongst the RSA contractors and awarded based on the contractors ability to satisfy the customers mission requirements. Modifications to the core spacecraft to meet the specific requirements of future missions are normal and expected. The RSA contract includes an On Ramp feature, which allows for the original solicitation to be periodically re-opened in order to give new vendors the opportunity to propose flight proven spacecraft designs. On Ramps also give vendors already awarded an RSA contract the opportunity to propose additional flight proven spacecraft designs and/or update their existing catalog designs. It is anticipated that the Rapid IV contract will be similar to the previous Rapid III contract and that it will remain a noncommercial FAR Part 15 contract. Those companies not familiar with Rapid III are welcome to visit the RSDO website: http://rsdo.gsfc.nasa.gov    for background information. Specifically, review material under Mission Statement and Rapid III menu tabs. The range of possible NASA missions is broad in scope, type and size. Therefore, the RSA contract would seek heritage spacecraft buses of various sizes, capabilities, lifetimes, orbit use and mission suitability, in order to be ready to support a variety of mission needs quickly. This RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for any information submitted in response to this RFI. The anticipated release date for the Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) for Rapid IV is January 2014. The anticipated release date for the final RFP is June 2014 with proposals due approximately 45 days after the solicitation release date. Award of contracts is contemplated for March 2015. Responses may be submitted via mail to NASA/GSFC, ATTN: Cynthia White, Code 401.1, Building 16W, Room N115D, Greenbelt, MD 20771; or via electronic transmission to Cynthia.l.white@nasa.gov. For further information please contact Cynthia White at 301-286-8772 or Cynthia.l.white@nasa.gov; or Diane Scheuerman at 301-286-4661 or diane.scheuerman-1@nasa.gov. Information submitted separate and apart from commercial brochures will be treated as proprietary, if so marked. All responses shall be submitted by May 3, 2013. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service. It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.

<p style="mso-hyphenate: none"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin">In the past, although the CMS (formally the Health Care Financing Administration) maintained a data collection system, gathering information on Medicare beneficiary&#8209;specific entitlement, demographic, cost, and utilization data, and Medicare facility&#8209;specific certification data, a comprehensive ESRD database was not originally available.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Specifically, detailed information, including both clinical and laboratory information on the etiology of the underlying renal disease, method of treatment, and overall outcomes for the ESRD&#8209;Medicare patient population was not available.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, the USRDS was created in May 1988 to collect and analyze information on the incidence, prevalence, morbidity, and mortality of ESRD in the U.S.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In the second phase of the USRDS project, the contract for the Coordinating Center was awarded.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin">The third phase of the USRDS project represented a change in structure for the USRDS.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The work of the USRDS was decentralized and spread across five separate contracts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The contracts were for the Coordinating Center, for data management of the data base and the production of the Annual Data Reports (ADRs); Cardiovascular Special Studies Center; Economic Special Studies Center; Quality of Life/Rehabilitation Special Studies Center; and the Nutrition Special Studies Center.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The fourth phase was a continuation of the structure put in place during the third phase; however, there was no Economic Special Studies Center.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All of the economic analyses were incorporated into the Coordinating Center and Special Study Center scopes of work.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin">Since the inception of the USRDS the CC, with the approval of the NIDDK, has undertaken several studies, including existing data analyses, and special studies; has provided data to several hundred investigators; and has produced yearly annual data reports (ADR) since 1989. By using the CMS Medicare files, it is estimated that the USRDS database contains information on nearly 100 percent of the ESRD population since the early 1980s.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Data from the 2012 ADR indicates that the 2010 incidence of ESRD was 116,946, with a December 31, 2010 point prevalence of 594,374.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Detailed information on patients undergoing various modalities of therapy, including disease categories, morbidity and mortality are available in the data base and presented in the annual ADRs and the internet at </span><a href="http://www.usrds.org"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin">http://www.usrds.org</span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin">.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin">During the history of USRDS, it has provided significant benefits to the U.S. nephrology and renal transplant communities, and the ESRD population at large.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Some of the accomplishments include the following: Construction of Database, Existing Data Studies, Data Provision to the Community, Annual Data Reports, In-Depth Analyses, Special Studies, and analyses of the Chronic Kidney Disease Population. </span></p>

<a href="mailto:bjorn.t.hale@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Louisville</a>
<DESC>The Corps of Engineers Louisville District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) from large scale construction projects (exceeding $25 million) for the following project:  <br>  <br> This project will provide an additional hangar to the National Museum of the USAF (NMUSAF), located at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH. The project scope adds 224,000 SF of space in a new metal barrel vaulted exhibition hangar with concrete foundation, structural frame and prefinished metal skin, providing proper display space for three distinct areas: the Space Gallery, the Presidential Gallery and the Global Reach Gallery. This additional Hangar will be located south of Hangar 3 and the Hall of Missiles and will be the same size and appearance as Hangar 3, which was constructed in 2003. The Hall of Missiles was constructed in 2004. This new Hangar will be designed to support exhibits on a concrete slab as well as from ceiling supports. The design will also include a new access corridor from the Hall of Missiles. The RFP and subsequent design will incorporate the most current seismic, AT/FP, ADA and federal and local design requirements. The project will be designed and required to achieve LEED 3.0 Silver certification. The existing NMUSAF is located just outside Area B of Wright-Patterson AFB (WPAFB). WPAFB is located less than one mile from the City of Fairborn, Ohio in Greene and Montgomery Counties, approximately 5 miles northeast of Dayton, Ohio. The Hangar 4 addition will be located to the southeast of Hangar 3, just beyond and connected to the existing Hall of Missiles silo structure. The site is located outside of the Base's controlled perimeter and is open to the general public. <br>  <br> A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:  <br>  <br> (a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.  <br>  <br> (b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will  <br>  <br> (1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and  <br> (2) Be consistent with law.  <br>  <br> Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.  <br>  <br> In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:  <br>  <br> a. Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts within the above referenced location by the Louisville District? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Louisville District contract? What type of project should or should not be considered for PLA?  <br>  <br> b. Is the use of PLAs effective in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement? What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using PLAs? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?  <br>  <br> c. Is the use of PLAs effective in producing labor-management stability? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area?  <br>  <br> d. Is the use of PLAs conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLAs used for those specific contracts?  <br>  <br> e. Projects will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on projects that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade?  <br>  <br> f. Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Information may reference current apprenticeship statistics and workforce age demographics.  <br>  <br> g. Completion of anticipated projects will require an extensive performance periods. Will a PLA impact the completion time? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?  <br>  <br> h. Where have PLAs been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project?  <br>  <br> i. Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential Offerors and subcontractors to meet small-business utilization goals? <br>  <br> Please provide your comments via e-mail to bjorn.t.hale@usace.army.mil no later than by 1000 hrs EST on 29 April 2013.  <br>

The USCG HC-144A aircraft is equipped with a Mission System Pallet (MSP). The MSP is a roll-on, roll-off suite of electronic equipment that enables the aircrew to compile data from the aircraft's multiple integrated sensors to transmit and receive both classified and unclassified information from other assets including other aircraft, surface vessels and shore facilities. With multiple voice and data communications capabilities, as well as satellite communications, the HC-144A will contribute, via a networked Command and Control system, to the Common Tactical Picture and Common Operating Picture.

The USCG requires that distributors or other potential sources be ASA-100 certified, or in compliance with other quality systems listed in FAA Advisory Circular 00-56A.These requirements are necessary in order for the USCG to maintain the capability to adequately support all USCG missions.<br /><br />REPLIES:<br />Responses to this notice should include company name, address, and telephone number, point of contact (POC), and complete product details, brochures, etc. which will allow the USCG to understand your product, configurations, auxiliary equipment, and options. Please state the approximate lead-time for acquiring your product and the details and terms of any standard warranty included with the product. Responses can be for all or for a few of the part numbers listed.</p>
<p>The applicable NAICS code is 336413- Aircraft assemblies, subassemblies, and parts (except engines) manufacturing. Please respond to the following questions (1) Is your business a large or small business and how many employees? (2) If small, does your firm qualify as a small, emergent business, or a small, disadvantaged business?

<p>The contractor is the sole publisher of the comprehensive universe of bond data necessary for the BLS to conduct its escalation procedure which ensures constant quality of service for its Producer Price Indices for the Investment Banking and Securities Dealing industry.

These data are important, objective, and unique measures of price inflation within the financial services sector which are used numerous public and private-sector customers. A vital data user, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which uses the PPI information as a price deflator for Gross Domestic Product (GDP), will be forced to find a substitute for the defunct PPI data series.</p>

<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) intends to expand into adjacent space and to award a renewal option under an existing lease using other than full and open competition, at 7101 College Boulevard in Overland Park, KS.

<p>Firms who are interested in commenting regarding the Government's intention to award this lease option under Other Than Full and Open Competition or in obtaining additional information regarding the above procurement should provide their written comments to Amy Fuller at Amy.Fuller@occ.treas.gov or to her attention at The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Real Estate Services, 400 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC 20219.

The resulting purchase order will be for a period of 24-28 February 2014 for four (4) days.
<p>The National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence has received all the pre-determined benefits as outlined prior to attending the 2013 RSA Conference. Since our entire leadership and management team was able to attend, the NCCoE markedly expanded its public perception and, consequently, cultivated key relationships with peer-to-peer executives at companies and government agencies. We used these initial relationships to foster material strategic partnerships that have evolved into NCEP partnerships and collaboration arrangements. Moreover, our attendance at RSA offered our leadership team to speak on panels that reinforced NIST's position as a technical thought leader and policy advisor.</p>
<p>With the NCCoE's emerging role in cybersecurity, it is imperative that the NCCoE and NIST continue their involvement in the RSA Conference. The Conference stands as the world's premier information security and cryptography conference and grants one of only a few opportunities each year for our technical and leadership teams to engage and collaborate with private, public, and international stakeholders who have a vested interest in improving cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Background Information - NIST has attended the RSA Conference every year since 1995 and made it a strategic priority to integrate the NCCoE into both the 2013 and future events. Each conference has extended NIST, and now NCCoE, an opportunity to broaden and deepen its reputation, contribution, and capabilities.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code is 561920 with a size standard of $7.0 million.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for quotations. However, responses received by 26 August 2013, 12:00pm, EST will be considered by the Government.</p>

<DESC>Solicitation VA69D-13-Q-1100 - Notice of Intent to Sole Source reference FAR 6.302-1. The Great Lakes Acquisition Center is procuring the following:

Custom Sterile Surgical Packs for VAMC Milwaukee & Lovell FHCC

The Great Lakes Acquisition Center intends to award on a sole source basis, IAW 10 USC 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, a contract to Cardinal Health 200, Inc, 1430 Waukegan Rd, Waukegan, IL 60085-6726, as the only responsible source to provide the above items. 

This procurement is to establish a new six month fixed-price, requirements contract for Custom Sterile Surgical Packs. This contract will be utilized by VAMC Milwaukee and Lovell FHCC via EDI. This is a short-term contract to allow uninterrupted receipt of surgical packs while a VISN-wide contract is being implemented.

VAMC Milwaukee and Lovell FHCC currently procure custom packs via EDI through the Medical Surgical Prime Vendor, Cardinal.  Packs are ordered three days a week, with next day delivery, per the terms of the MSPV contract.  Custom packs are made up of individually selected components and are specific to each facility where they are used.  The packs are assembled by a manufacturer, sterilized, and shipped to the MSPV for storage.  The whole process takes 6-8 weeks from pack assembly to VAMC delivery.  

The approximate award value for this procurement is $358,796.90

The approximate award date for this procurement is June 1, 2013 and will last six months after receipt of award

A recent notice from the NAC regarding dropping custom surgical packs from FSS, as of June 1, 2013, has created the need for VISN 12 to expeditiously put a contract in place to ensure continuity of sources. 

Changing pack manufacturers, components, or distributors takes several months to implement.  Cardinal Health is the only vendor which has the ability to distribute any of the several manufacturers currently in use in VISN 12.  The June 1 expiration of the custom pack FSS contracts necessitates the execution of a contract which will continue MSPV distribution of the packs.  Cardinal is the only vendor which will ensure uninterrupted delivery of custom packs to VAMC Milwaukee and Lovell FHCC.

Failure to establish a contract will require individual orders for custom packs to be awarded through Contracting activity, which will not allow for just in time delivery.  Space concerns and current VA inventory metrics do not allow for overstocking of packs.  Packs are generally bulky and Logistics must keep no more than 2-4 weeks of stock on hand to meet performance measures.  Failure to procure packs on a timely basis can affect scheduled surgeries, resulting in delayed or cancelled cases and a decrease in the quality of care.

The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10USC 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement. The applicable NAICS Code is 339112 and the size standard is 500 employees. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit quotes. This notice of intent is not a request for quotation or a solicitation of offers. However, all quotes received within three days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement upon receipt of response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. There will be no solicitation available.

<DESC>SCOPE: The objectives of this program are to transfer the Air Force Research Laboratory Sensors Directorate Aerospace Components and Subsystems Technology Division (AFRL/RYD) developed 0.14&micro;m Aluminum Gallium Nitride (AlGaN)/Gallium Nitride (GaN) on Silicon Carbide (SiC) manufacturing process to industry and establish a domestic open foundry with the capacity to meet the DOD needs. The domestic open foundry needs to be able to fabricate designs from all DOD sources at a competitive price. The ManTech emphasis will be on maturing the 0.14&micro;m AlGaN/GaN on SiC manufacturing process to achieve a Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) of 6. This will include verifying the process transfer by comparing results with AFRL. In addition, the focus will be on increasing yield and reliability, while reducing the cost for RF power amplifiers, low noise amplifiers, and high frequency switches.

Solicitations shall specify that award will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors. If the contracting officer documents the file pursuant to 15.304(c)(3)(iii), past performance need not be an evaluation factor in lowest price technically acceptable source selections.

<DESC>NASA/KSC has a requirement for eighteen (quantity:18), 30-gallon drums of Dibrom 14, manufactured by AMVC Corporation. The only known authorized distributor of this product for the KSC area is Adapco Incorporated of Sanford, Florida. This product will be used to control mosquitoes in outlying areas of KSC, where the use of aerial equipment is necessary to apply chemicals to areas impossible to spray without an aircraft. Dibrom 14 is supplied annually by KSC to the Brevard County Mosquito Control District (BCMCD) in accordance with the Mosquito Control Agreement between KSC, Air Force Eastern Test Range, US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), and Brevard County. There are several areas at the launch pads and Launch Complex 39, where normal chemicals used at KSC cannot be sprayed due to chemical corrosiveness and flight hardware. Moreover, these areas are also very large and impossible to spray without an aircraft, which KSC does not possess. The agreement provides the equipment (aircraft) to spray large areas of water in the KSC area to control mosquitoes without having to spray directly around the launch pads. Dibrom 14 is the only chemical that can be used because it is the only chemical BCMCD is licensed to spray in the KSC and surrounding areas. This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, which is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ); quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Offerors are required to use the On-Line RFQ system to submit their quote.  The On-line RFQ system is linked above or it may be accessed at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=C&pin=.  The information required by FAR Subpart 12.6 is included in the on-line RFQ. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12 and the Simplified Acquisition Procedures set forth in FAR Part 13. Questions regarding this acquisition must be submitted in writing to Nicole.Rivera@nasa.gov no later than 2:00 PM EST on 4/26/2013.	 It is the quoter's responsibility to monitor this site for the release of amendments (if any).

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.

<DESC>Located within the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs (NEA), the Iraq Strategic Partnership Office and the Pakistan and Afghanistan Support office seeks to create vibrant partnerships between America and the citizens of the Middle East and South and Central Asia to empower them to build more pluralistic, participatory, and prosperous societies through the Iraq Strategic Partnership Office and the Pakistan and Afghanistan Support Office. In support of these goals, ISPO and PASO work with non-governmental organizations, the private sector, and academic institutions, as well as governments.
<p>U.S. assistance also continues to help build the capacity of Iraq's civil society organizations and elected representatives, including assistance in the modernization of Iraqi law and seeks to increase participation in the democratic process. U.S. bilateral assistance aims to preserve the strategic, political, and economic importance of the U.S.-Iraq partnership in a changing Middle East region.</p>
<p>The United States has made a long-term commitment to help Afghanistan rebuild itself after years of war. The U.S., along with others in the international community, currently provides resources and expertise to Afghanistan in a variety of areas, including humanitarian relief and assistance, capacity-building, security needs, counter-narcotic programs, and infrastructure projects. The U.S. also supports the Afghan Government in its efforts to establish a framework for a vibrant civil society, one that emphasizes democratic principles through a rule of law and creates accountable and transparent forms of government.<br />The United States and its international partners remain committed to helping Afghans realize their vision for a country that is stable, democratic, and economically successful, and to an Afghan Government. <br /><br />The Iraq Strategic Partnership Office (ISPO) and the Pakistan and Afghanistan Support Office (PASO) seek support in the following areas: monitoring and evaluation, project support and management, conference/training facilitation, and support. These functions are integral to the successful implementation of ISPO/PASO's mission - supporting indigenous efforts to build more pluralistic, participatory, and prosperous societies in Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Hiring and deployment is required to be accomplished under severe time constraints. In order to accomplish the mission, it is necessary to hire contractors to fill any employment gaps.</p>

(b) Offers shall be evaluated in accordance with the criteria contained in the solicitation. Technical capability, Factors B and C below, may be evaluated by how well the proposed services meet the Government requirement. Past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with the procedures in Subpart 15.3. (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. Proposals submitted in response to this request for proposal will be evaluated based upon the following non-price or non-cost factors, which are of equal importance:
Factor (A) Past Performance: sellers shall submit not less than two references for services performed during the past three years.  Each reference shall include: the company or agency name, address, contract or order number, point(s) of contract phone number and email address(es). References provided may be contacted by the Government.  Their statements will be used in the evaluation of the offerors proposal.  In addition, any information obtained by the Government from references outside of the offerors proposal may also be used, in a similar manner, in the technical evaluation of the offerors proposal to the extent appropriate. Past performance information provided by references, from Government records, or from other than the sources identified by the offeror may be used in the evaluation under any or all applicable evaluation factors.  In addition to the foregoing, PIPRS.gov will be used as a source of past performance information in the source selection process, in addition to any other past performance information required under this solicitation.  All past performance information will be used for both the responsibility determination and the best value decision. Factor (B) Quality Control Program:  Proposals must include the offerors proposed Quality Control Program for evaluation.  See the Statement of Work for the Quality Control Program requirements for this award. Factor (C) Operation Management Plan.  Proposals must include the offerors proposed Operation Management Plan for evaluation.  See the Statement of Work for the Operation Management Plan requirements for this award. (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
Award shall be made to the vendor whose proposal, conforming to this RFP, is determined to be the most advantageous to the Government, cost or price and the other non-cost or non-price factors listed above.  In determining which proposal offers the greatest value or advantage to the Government, overall technical merit will be considered less important than price or cost.  The degree of importance of price or cost as an evaluation factor will increase with the degree of equality in the technical merits of the proposals.  Between acceptable proposals with a significant difference in technical merit, a determination will be made as to whether the additional technical merit or benefits reflected by a higher priced proposal warrants payment of the additional price or cost. Offerors must have completed ORCA registration and comply with the provision at 52.212-3.

<p>The Grantee's Energy Department (EED) is responsible for providing electricity distribution services to 393,677 electricity customers (approximately 70 percent of all electricity customers) within the Ekurhuleni metropolitan area. Since 2000, EED has undertaken significant efforts to improve its operational efficiency and to refurbish, modernize, and extend its electricity distribution infrastructure. This Feasibility Study would evaluate the technical, financial, environmental and other critical aspects of implementing advanced metering infrastructure in Ekurhuleni, South Africa. The Feasibility Study would include the development of a smart metering implementation roadmap and the design of a smart metering pilot project.</p>
<p>The primary objective of the Study is to provide the Grantee with analyses and recommendations that will support its decision-making with regard to the implementation of advanced metering infrastructure. The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a US $695,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency ("USTDA").</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:</p>

<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.

<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">10:00 a.m., May 20, 2013</span></strong> at the above address. Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP. Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted. The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals. The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project. The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>
<p>If approved, the FS would include an analysis of EED's existing electricity distribution system, an assessment of EED's performance in key areas, an evaluation of the technical, financial and regulatory feasibility of implementing advanced metering infrastructure in Ekurhuleni, the preparation of a smart metering implementation roadmap, and the preparation of a smart metering pilot project.</p>

This may result in an award to a higher rated, higher priced offeror, where the decision is consistent with the evaluation factors and the Contracting Officer reasonably determines that the technical approach and/or superior past performance of the higher priced offeror outweighs the cost difference. The Contracting Officer will make an integrated assessment based on the evaluation factors described above.</p>

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.  <br>    <br>  	HQ Army Materiel Command	  <br>  	Office of Command Counsel  <br>  	9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401  <br>  	Ft.

The HQAMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an alternative dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum. These procedures apply to the HQAMC-Level Protest Program only. <BR> <BR>?	Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract. 
Federal Government employees, unions or installations are not considered interested parties for the purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest. 
Private-sector offerors on acquisitions subject to OMB Circular No. A-76 are also not considered interested parties for purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest. <BR> <BR>?	Protest decision authority: The AMC command counsel is designated as the HQAMC protest decision authority. In the absence of command counsel the deputy command counsel is designated. ?	Time for filing a protest: A HQAMC protest shall be filed in accordance with the timeframes set out in FAR 33.103(e). HQAMC office hours are 8 AM to 4:30 PM Eastern Standard Time. Time for filing any document expires at 4:30 PM (EST) on the given day. ?	Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the HQAMC-level protest, the HQAMC-level protest will be dismissed.

?	Required information: Protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester. o	Protester?s name o	Address o	Telephone number o	Fax number o	Solicitation or contract number o	Identity of the contracting activity and the contracting officer?s name o	Detailed statement of all legal and factual grounds for protest (mere disagreement with the decisions of contracting officers does not constitute grounds for protest) o	Copies of all relevant documents o	Request for a ruling o	Request for relief <BR> <BR>?	Where to file: An agency protest may be filed with either the contracting officer or to HQAMC. o	Protest to HQAMC shall be filed at: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft. Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 Fax: (703) 806-8866 or 8875 o	Packages sent by FedEx or UPS should be addressed to: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel Room 2-1SE3401 1412 Jackson Loop Fort Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 o	Protest to Contracting Officer shall be filed at: Appropriate installation address or see FAR Clause 52.233-2 in section L for address. ?	Processing of HQAMC-level protests: Within 10 working days after the protest is filed, the contracting officer, with the assistance of legal counsel, shall file with the HQAMC Office of Command Counsel (ATTN: AMCCC-PL) one copy of an administrative report in response to the protest. Reports shall be sent by fax, over-night mail or hand-delivered to ensure timely receipt. 
The HQAMC protest decision authority will issue a written decision within 20 working days of the protest filing. The written decision will be binding on AMC and its contracting activities. 

For good cause shown, the HQAMC protest decision authority may grant extensions of time for filing the administrative report and for the issuance of the written decision. When such an extension is granted, the protester and all interested parties shall be notified within one working day of the decision to grant the extension. ?	Remedies: The HQAMC protest decision authority may grant any one or combination of the following remedies: o	Terminate the contract o	Recompete the requirement o	Issue a new solicitation o	Refrain from exercising options under the contract o	Award a contract consistent with statute and regulation o	Pay appropriate costs as stated in FAR 33.102(b)(2) o	Other remedies as the HQAMC protest decision authority determines necessary to correct a defect. <BR> <BR>?	Protests before award: When a protest is filed with HQAMC prior to award, a contract may not be awarded unless authorized by the HQAMC director of contracting, in accordance with FAR 33.103(f). ?	Protests after award: When a protest is filed with HQ AMC within 10 calendar days after award, or within five calendar days of debriefing for any debriefing that was requested as required by FAR 15.506, the contracting officer shall suspend performance. 
The HQAMC director of contracting may authorize contract performance, notwithstanding the protest, upon a written finding that contract performance will be in the best interests of the United States; or urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect the interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a decision from the HQAMC protest decision authority. 
52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 2 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR PRESSURE BOX FRAME .  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to answer the following technical question: Q1: Does the Buy American Act mean that all raw material (such as the 304 Stainless Steel) must be domestically manufactured in the USA?  Sometimes, the domestic stainless steel supplier has raw material for which the origin might be Russia or Italy.	Is it acceptable to use foreign material purchased from a domestic supplier as long as its not specifically called out on the drawing to use domestically produced material? A1: Its acceptable to use foreign material in accordance with FAR 25.101, For manufactured end products, the Buy American Act uses a two-part test to define a domestic end product. (1) The article must be manufactured in the United States; and (2) The cost of domestic components must exceed 50 percent of the cost of all the components. The due date for receipt of offers is not extended. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on April 16, 2013.

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Authority. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.

<DESC>Questions received in regards to Combined Synopsis/Solicitation HSCG79-13-Q-PCR028 (D17 Remote Site Refueling) and the Government Response:
<p>QUESTION #1:<br />"Does this solicitation call for the air carrier to provide the barge? Or would an air carrier only bid on the segments to provide helicopter services and the barge would be provided by another source?"</p>
<p>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO QUESTION #1:</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the air carrier to provide ALL aspects to get the fuel to the site and into the tanks.</p>
<p>QUESTION #2:<br />I have a question regarding the various Statements of Work. On the 1st page of each SOW, in the 4th paragraph, it states:<br />"...Contractor shall coordinate to have Coast Guard maintenance vendor on site to observe refueling operations at [a specific named site] and at least one other site."<br /><br />CLIN 0001 Juneau AOR Remote Sites names the specific site to be "Naked Island". Naked Island is in the Valdez Repeater Network, not Juneau.<br /><br />CLIN 0002 Kodiak AOR Remote Sites names the specific site to be "Naked Island". Naked Island is in the Valdez Repeater Network, not Kodiak. <br /><br />CLIN 0003 Kodiak AOR Sitkinak Dome names the specific site to be "Naked Island". Naked Island is in the Valdez Repeater Network, not Kodiak, which Sitkinak Dome is a Kodiak Network site. <br /><br />CLIN 0004 Valdez AOR Remote Sites names the specific site to be "Mt. Robert Barron". Mount Robert Barron is in the Juneau Repeater Network, not Valdez. Also, this year, it is specified that Mount Robert Barron will not be refueled under this contract.<br /><br />CLIN 0005 Tuklung AOR Remote Sites names the specific site to be "Mt. Robert Barron". Mount Robert Barron is in the Juneau Repeater Network, not Tuklung, which Tuklung is a stand-alone network site out of Dillingham. This year, it is specified that Mount Robert Barron will not be refueled under this contract.</p>
<p><br />GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO QUESTION #2:</p>
<p>For CLIN's 0001, 0002, 0003, 0004: DELETE the sentence "Contractor shall coordinate to have the Coast Guard maintenance vendor on site to observe refueling operations at Naked Island and at least one other site".</p>
<p>For CLIN 0005: Remove the sentence "Contractor shall coordinate to have the Coast Guard maintenance vendor on site to observe refueling operations at Mt Robert Barron and at least one other site".</p>
<p><br />REPLACE CLIN's 0001, 0002, 0003, 0004 DELETED sentences WITH:<br />"Contractor shall coordinate to have Coast Guard maintenance vendor on site to observe refueling of at least two sites, if applicable."</p>
<p><br />REPLACE CLIN 0005: DELETED Sentence WITH:<br />"Contractor shall coordinate to have Coast Guard maintenance vendor on site to observe refueling of at least two sites, if applicable."</p>
<p>On the observation of refueling, if the D17 Vendor doesn't show up, then the vendor will provide before and after photographs of the fuel gauge, advanced coordination between the vendor and maintenance contractor should be made in good faith.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>QUESTION #3:</p>
<p>Can you tell me who the incumbent is on this project?</p>
<p><br />GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO QUESTION #3</p>
<p>The two vendors from FY12 were:</p>
<p>- Pollux Aviation - Wasilla, AK<br />- Coastal Helicopters - Juneau, AK</p>
<p><br />QUESTION #4:</p>
<p>1. You have a requirement for 24oz of methanol to be put in each 500 gallon tank, is this requirement for each tank we fill or for each tank on site? If we only need to fill 1 or 2 tanks do we have to make sure the ethanol is put in each tank or is it a requirement for only the gallons filled? example: Say the site has a total of 6 each 500 gallon tanks (about 2,400 site capacity) and the fuel requirement is only 1,000 gallons, do we have to add extra methanol to the untouched tanks?</p>
<p>2. Because we contract out the marine services do we need to supply a copy of the vessel Certificate of Inspection for vessels over 15 gross tons?</p>
<p>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO QUESTION #4:</p>
<p>Response to #1: Methanol shall only be provided to each tank filled.</p>
<p>Response to #2: It is the responsibility of the vendor ( prime contractor) , that any subcontractor(s) used meets applicable Federal, State and Local regulations/laws.</p>

Because of this, the Government is under no obligation and is, in fact, unable to maintain a mailing list. The burden is therefore on any interested parties to periodically access the above internet address in order to obtain any amendments which may be issued. Failure to obtain any amendments and to respond to them prior to the date and time set for receipt of proposals may render your proposal nonresponsive and result in the rejection of the proposal. <br /><br />NOTICE TO ALL CONTRACTORS: All contractors who provide goods/services to the Department of Defense (DoD) must be registered in the Central Contractors Register (CCR). You may register via the Internet at https://www.uscontractorregistration.com/. Further information may be obtained through the internet at: http://www.acq.osd.mil/faq.html.<br /><br />If you have any further questions, please call Brendon M. Courtade, (586) 282.9748 or e-mail at brendon.m.courtade.civ@mail.mil. <br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Additionally, the Government seeks to collect data from companies interested in this requirement. If your company is interested in this procurement, please provide a response to the contract specialist, Mr. Brendon Courtade at Brendon.m.courtade.civ@mail.mil no later than 20 Sep 2012. NOTE: These responses are voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to the sources survey and any follow-on information requests. Responses are NOT required to bid on any future solicitation. See below:<br /><br />GENERAL INFORMATION: The U.S. Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this survey. The U.S. Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C. 1905 to protect information qualifying as "confidential" under this statute. [To avoid possible confusion with the meaning of the term "confidential" in the context of Classified Information," we will use the term "PROPRIETARY."] Pursuant to this statute, the U.S. Government is willing to accept any trade secret or PROPRIETARY restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following: <br /><br />1. Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data with the restrictive legend (all caps) "PROPRIETARY" with any explanatory text, so that the U.S. Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected. <br /><br />2. In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly confidential (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as "PROPRIETARY" may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected. <br /><br />3. The U.S. Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the U.S. Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the U.S. Government will not be protected once in the public domain. Data already in the possession of the U.S. Government will be protected in accordance with the U.S. Government's rights in the data. <br /><br />4. Confidential data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the U.S. Government, shall contain the "PROPRIETARY" legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself. Where appropriate for only portions of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends 'PROPRIETARY PORTION BEGINS:" and "PROPRIETARY PORTION ENDS." <br /><br />5. In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the U.S. Government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text. <br /><br />6. The U.S. Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses that contain confidential information may receive only limited or no consideration since the Respondent's marking of data as "PROPRIETARY" will preclude disclosure of same outside the U.S. Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort. The U.S. Government will use its best efforts to evaluate those responses that contain confidential information without using support contractors consistent with the resources available. <br /><br />INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THE QUESTIONNAIRE:<br /><br />1. Number each response with the appropriate question number.<br /><br />2. You do not have to repeat the question in your response. <br /><br />3. If you cannot answer the question, please indicate "No Response."<br /><br />4. If a response will satisfy another question, state: "See response to question XX." <br /><br />5. Include relevant sales media and product manuals. If providing an ACROBAT formatted manual, annotate the manual to indicate which material is applicable to the questions. If preferred, include Internet Web links to locations where animations/videos may be viewed. <br /><br />6. If your sales media and/or manuals contain a restricted distribution statement, issue a release statement indicating that the restricted material may be distributed to Army personnel involved with this Sources Survey. <br /><br />7. Spell out any acronyms in their first instance. <br /><br />8. Clearly mark any confidential information. If applicable the front page of your response package should state "Confidential Information Contained." <br /><br />Provide a release statement indicating that the confidential information may distributed to Army personnel involved with this Market Survey. <br /><br />A. GENERAL <br /><br />1. Manufacturer <br />a. Name <br />b. Mailing Address <br />c. Cage Code (if any) <br />d. Website <br /><br />2. Personnel Responding to Questionnaire <br />a. Name <br />b.

Failure to obtain any amendments and to respond to them prior to the date and time set for receipt of proposals may render your proposal nonresponsive and result in the rejection of the proposal. <br /><br />NOTICE TO ALL CONTRACTORS: All contractors who provide goods/services to the Department of Defense (DoD) must be registered in the Central Contractors Register (CCR). You may register via the Internet at https://www.uscontractorregistration.com/. Further information may be obtained through the internet at: http://www.acq.osd.mil/faq.html.<br /><br />If you have any further questions, please call Brendon M. Courtade, (586) 282.9748 or e-mail at brendon.m.courtade.civ@mail.mil. <br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Additionally, the Government seeks to collect data from companies interested in this requirement. If your company is interested in this procurement, please provide a response to the contract specialist, Mr. Brendon Courtade at Brendon.m.courtade.civ@mail.mil no later than 20 Sep 2012. NOTE: These responses are voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to the sources survey and any follow-on information requests. Responses are NOT required to bid on any future solicitation. See below:<br /><br />GENERAL INFORMATION: The U.S. Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this survey. The U.S. Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C. 1905 to protect information qualifying as "confidential" under this statute. [To avoid possible confusion with the meaning of the term "confidential" in the context of Classified Information," we will use the term "PROPRIETARY."] Pursuant to this statute, the U.S. Government is willing to accept any trade secret or PROPRIETARY restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following: <br /><br />1. Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data with the restrictive legend (all caps) "PROPRIETARY" with any explanatory text, so that the U.S. Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected. <br /><br />2. In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly confidential (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as "PROPRIETARY" may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected. <br /><br />3. The U.S. Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the U.S. Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the U.S. Government will not be protected once in the public domain. Data already in the possession of the U.S. Government will be protected in accordance with the U.S. Government's rights in the data. <br /><br />4. Confidential data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the U.S. Government, shall contain the "PROPRIETARY" legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself. Where appropriate for only portions of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends 'PROPRIETARY PORTION BEGINS:" and "PROPRIETARY PORTION ENDS." <br /><br />5. In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the U.S. Government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text. <br /><br />6. The U.S. Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses that contain confidential information may receive only limited or no consideration since the Respondent's marking of data as "PROPRIETARY" will preclude disclosure of same outside the U.S. Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort. The U.S. Government will use its best efforts to evaluate those responses that contain confidential information without using support contractors consistent with the resources available. <br /><br />INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THE QUESTIONNAIRE:<br /><br />1. Number each response with the appropriate question number.<br /><br />2. You do not have to repeat the question in your response. <br /><br />3. If you cannot answer the question, please indicate "No Response."<br /><br />4. If a response will satisfy another question, state: "See response to question XX." <br /><br />5. Include relevant sales media and product manuals. If providing an ACROBAT formatted manual, annotate the manual to indicate which material is applicable to the questions. If preferred, include Internet Web links to locations where animations/videos may be viewed. <br /><br />6. If your sales media and/or manuals contain a restricted distribution statement, issue a release statement indicating that the restricted material may be distributed to Army personnel involved with this Sources Survey. <br /><br />7. Spell out any acronyms in their first instance. <br /><br />8. Clearly mark any confidential information. If applicable the front page of your response package should state "Confidential Information Contained." <br /><br />Provide a release statement indicating that the confidential information may distributed to Army personnel involved with this Market Survey. <br /><br />A. GENERAL <br /><br />1. Manufacturer <br />a. Name <br />b. Mailing Address <br />c. Cage Code (if any) <br />d. Website <br /><br />2. Personnel Responding to Questionnaire <br />a. Name <br />b.

<p>Description of Services/Supplies: Therapeutic Equivalence of Generic Iron Complex Product</p>
<p>CONTRACTING OFFICE<br />U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Food and Drug Administration Agency (FDA) / Office of Acquisitions and Grants Services (OAGS)</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION <br />This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of small businesses (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, and HUBZone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses) to evaluate the therapeutic equivalence of generic sodium ferric gluconate iron complex Nulecit<sup>TM</sup> and its RLD Ferrlecit&reg;.</p>
<p>The Contractor's capability statement shall demonstrate the company's ability to meet the following requirements. Please provide a detailed description of your company's (including its teammates, if applicable) experience and demonstrated abilities to deliver the following: <br />Background:<br />Parenteral iron injection products are used to treat anemia, particularly in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). There are four types of parenteral iron complex products available in North America: iron sucrose, sodium ferric gluconate, iron dextran, and ferumoxytol. All parenteral iron products are colloids comprising a continuous aqueous medium and particles of carbohydrate protected iron oxyhydroxide. <br /><br />After intravenous administration, iron colloid particles are processed by phagocytes and iron ions are delivered to the lysosomes within the cell as part of the intracellular labile iron pool. The phagocyte uptake and biodistribution of iron complex particles depend upon their physicochemical properties. If iron is not needed immediately, it is stored in the form of ferritin or hemosiderin. When the iron is needed in the body, iron is released from the cell and transferrin binds iron ions and delivers them to their destination. If transferrin is oversaturated or if the iron complex product is so unstable that iron is spontaneously released at a rate that exceeds transferrin binding capacity, non-transferrin bound iron (NTBI) is formed in the plasma. NTBI can be toxic to cells as it acts as a catalyst in the formation of free radicals from reactive oxygen species. <br /><br />In March 2011, FDA approved the first generic sodium ferric gluconate iron complex Nulecit<sup>TM</sup>, an alternative to Ferrlecit&reg;. It has been suggested (in a March 2011 EU guidance) that generic iron formulations could have higher levels of labile iron, leading to the formation of a greater amount of nontransferrin-bound iron (NTBI) in vivo than the RLD that would potentiate oxidative stress and inflammation, then resulting in direct cellular damage and possibly increasing the risk of atherosclerotic disease. FDA's approval of generic iron complex products was based on equivalence in product characteristics supported by equivalence in in vivo pharmacokinetic studies. Products that meet these approval standards should have no significant difference in NTBI. The March 2011 EU guidance reflects the fact that the EU equivalence approach recommends non-clinical studies, unlike the FDA approach, which sets strict standards for product characteristic equivalence.<br />The Agency believes that a battery of physicochemical characterization tests including in-vitro labile iron determination would ensure comparable tissue distribution and no more in vivo labile iron leakage from generic formulations than that from RLD. Well controlled, prospective studies that investigate iron tissue distribution in preclinical species and compare NTBI levels between brand and generic in hemodialysis patients may confirm the agency's approval criteria and help address the public concerns.<br />Statement of Work (SOW) or Objectives:</p>
<p>The objectives of this requirement is to evaluate the therapeutic equivalence of generic sodium ferric gluconate iron complex Nulecit<sup>TM</sup> and its RLD Ferrlecit&reg;. Specific aims are: 1) compare reticuloendothelial system (RES) uptake of RLD and generic; 2) compare biodistribution of the RLD and generic in animal models; 3) conduct in-vivo study to compare plasma NTBI levels and oxidative stress after i.v. administration of RLD and generic in healthy subjects or patients. This study is part of post-market surveillance that can help address potential concerns regarding the quality of generic iron complex products and support the Agency's review standards.</p>
<p>Below are the detailed descriptions:</p>
<p>1) Conduct in-vitro phagocytosis assays to compare RES uptake of RLD and generic. Since a battery of in vitro characterization tests have proved physicochemical equivalence between Nulecit<sup>TM</sup> and its RLD Ferrlecit&reg;, the rate and extent of phagocyte uptake of generic and RLD should be similar.<br />2) Determine the time-dependent iron content in the major target organ (e.g., plasma, RES, target tissues) and compare biodistribution of RLD and generic in appropriate animal models. Time points for sampling of target tissues should be selected to cover the main time-concentration profiles. <br />3) Conduct a prospective, randomized, 2-way crossover study to compare plasma NTBI levels in hemodialysis patients treated with generic and RLD (healthy control can be used). Utilize in vitro and in vivo biomarkers such as malondialdehyde, heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1) RNA or others to evaluate the oxidative stress and toxicity caused by generic and RLD.</p>
<p>Statistical analyses will be conducted to determine whether there are any significant differences between generic and RLD in the above tests.</p>
<p>This is a 3-year project. Due to the sequential nature of in vivo pharmacokinetic studies, this project is non-severable.</p>

<DESC>The project involves floodplain restoration on approximately 9 acres adjacent to Upper Newsome Creek and reconstruction of Haysfork Sediment Pond. The activities will mitigate the environmental impacts of past dredge and placer mining. The work includes the regrading floodplain along with associated dredge pile relocation, earthwork and revegetation. Work at the sediment pond includes removal of existing features and construction of a new spillway. Revegetation of the disturbed sites will consist of erosion control seeding and on-site transplants only.&nbsp; Optional items have been included for additional dredge pile relocation, mulching/seeding/slash placement&nbsp;and soil source stockpiling.&nbsp; Optional items shall be awarded concurrent with the base items as funding allows.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;A contractor will be required to provide a qualified stream restoration specialist to represent them and supervise during the following construction activities: 1) equipment operation required for site access (setting temporary bridges at stream crossings), 2) equipment operation within the active channel or on stream banks, 3) floodplain construction quality control (Government estimates 2 days per week) and 4) sediment pond spillway construction. The representative shall possess a Bachelor's degree in fish biology, hydrology, geomorphology, engineering or a related field, at a minimum, though a Master's degree is preferred. In addition, the representative shall possess a minimum of 10 years related experience and a minimum of 3-5 years of experience performing/overseeing similar stream restoration projects.</p>
<p>The project is located on the Red River Ranger District, Nez Perce National Forest, Idaho County, Idaho. To reach the project site, travel approximately 40 miles east of Grangeville via State Highway 14 to the junction with Newsome Creek Road (Forest Service Road 1858). Proceed up Newsome Creek Road, past the old Newsome Townsite, approximately 7 miles to a gated access road that takes off sharply uphill and to the right. This road can be identified by the large boulders that have been placed by the gate. A similar road takes off just prior to this access road but no boulders are present. Motorized access is prohibited. The project site is located approximately 1 &frac12; miles from the gate. A formal pre-bid tour is not planned at this time. <br /><br />The estimated price range for the project if the base and all optional items are awarded is between $500,000-$1,000,000. Snow, high water, and saturated ground conditions typically restrict equipment access until early July. This project constitutes Phase III of a multi-phase project. Phases I and II, located upstream from the current project area, were completed in 2011 and 2012.<br /><br />Solicitation was issued on 4/19/13.&nbsp; Performance period for the work is July 15-October 31, 2013.&nbsp; In stream work must be completed prior to September 30, 2013.&nbsp; Bid bonds are required.&nbsp; FAXed offers shall not be accepted.&nbsp; <br /><br />This acquisition has been set aside for HUBZone Concerns.&nbsp; Offerors must be certified HUBZone concerns with the U.S. Small Business Administration to be eligible for consideration.&nbsp; For information regarding the on-line application process, go to the following website at <a href="https://eweb1.sba.gov/hubzone/internet/">https://eweb1.sba.gov/hubzone/internet/</a>.&nbsp; The certification&nbsp;process can take more than 90 days to complete.</p>

<DESC><strong>Request for Information (RFI) Number: RFIFY2013<br />&nbsp;<br />Subject: Agents and/or Approaches for Treatment of New and Emerging Infectious Threats.<br /><br />Key Dates:<br />Release date: 18 March 2013<br />Submission of Information date:&nbsp;18 June 2013</strong>&nbsp;
<p><strong><br />Issued by:<br />Biological Advanced Research and Development Authority</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. Government has a responsibility to protect the health and safety of its citizens. The American people continue to face a host of national health security threats from chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) agents and emerging infectious diseases. Under the leadership of HHS, the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasure Enterprise (PHEMCE) is the coordinating body for the federal agencies in charge of protecting the civilian population from potential adverse health impacts through the use of medical countermeasures, which are medicines, devices, or other medical interventions that can lessen the harmful effects of these threats. The first version of the strategy and implementation plan formed by the Government in 2007 provided a framework for product development successes that were made possible through funding authorized under the Project BioShield Act of 2004. An updated (2012) Strategy and Implementation plan accounts for gains made and further expands the efforts needed to improve national capability and capacity to respond to major public health threats.<br /><br />The 2012 HHS PHEMCE Strategy articulates the strategic direction and will guide policies and decisions for the end-to-end mission of the PHEMCE. The companion 2012 HHS PHEMCE Implementation Plan describes the activities and programs that HHS, in collaboration with its interagency partners, is undertaking over the next five years to increase MCM preparedness for national health security threats. This Strategy and the Implementation Plans together provide the blueprints the PHEMCE will follow in the near-, mid-, and long-terms to make the best use of available resources to enhance national health security.</p>
<p>This Notice seeks declarations of technical capabilities and various information, data, and materials from the public on their interest and ability to develop new or currently marketed therapeutics or prophylactics for mitigation of illness caused by new and/ or emerging chemical and/or biological threats (NETs). Of particular interest are agents that modulate the host innate immune or inflammatory response or otherwise target host factors facilitating pathogenesis.</p>
<p><strong>Description<br /><br /></strong>This is a Request for Information (RFI) only. It is not a request for proposals and does not commit the Government to issue a solicitation, make any contract award, nor pay any costs associated with responding to this announcement. All submitted information shall remain with the Government and will not be returned.<br /><br />To date, the focus of the PHEMCE has been on developing, acquiring and stockpiling medical countermeasures (MCMs) to manage potential exposure of the civilian population to specified CBRN threats and pandemic influenza. Key assumptions of this approach are that potential threats will be known or quickly diagnosed, therapeutic agents exist and have been FDA approved for the specific threat, and that it is the function of the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) to maintain such agents for deployment as needed. Truly novel or emerging threats (NETs) would present significant challenges, particularly if currently marketed and stockpiled MCMs lack efficacy in the treatment or prophylaxis of pathogen associated disease and/ or if rapid diagnosis of the threat was unavailable. The development of MCMs based on augmentation or modification of the host response or other novel mechanisms of action could enhance our Nation's preparedness to respond to NETs and potentially help address the increasing problem of antimicrobial resistance while reducing the total cost of maintaining the SNS. <br /><br />Novel therapeutics that augment or modulate the host immune system and/ or specific host inflammatory components may provide benefit in treating a wide array of pathogens. Agents functioning as immunomodulators that reduce the morbidity associated with pathogen-induced inflammation are also of interest. Such treatments or prophylactic agents may have value in treating individuals exposed to a pathogen for which definitive medical countermeasures do not exist. Host-directed therapeutics that lend themselves to empiric treatment in the absence of firm microbiologic diagnosis would offer significant operational advantages.<br /><br />Potential mechanisms may involve approaches focusing on:<br /><br />&bull; Innate defense regulators e.g. defensins and defensin mimetics: host defense polypeptides which are active against fungi, bacteria and many viruses<br />&bull; T-cell control (CTLA-4/ IDO antagonists/ CD28): down regulation of T-cell suppression or up-regulation of T-cell stimulatory factors<br />&bull; Cell surface modification: reducing ability of pathogens to bind to target cells<br />&bull; Vaccine adjuvants: increasing immunogenicity and/ or reducing required antigen levels<br />&bull; Pattern recognition agonists, e.g. TLRs: either as adjuvants or agents up-regulating the immune response<br />&bull; Interferons and other cytokines: as T, B cell stimulatory factors and up-regulation of adaptive immunity and Mx system agonists<br />&bull; Immunomodulators: reduction of cytokines linked to morbidity and extreme inflammation<br />&bull; NK cell agonists that may stimulate innate NK or other null cell activities that result in better and sooner recovery to infectious pathogens in an emergency<br /><br />Compounds that are approved for other indications but which can be repurposed/repositioned as a MCM are of considerable interest as well. <br /><br /><strong>Target Profile<br /></strong><br />The BARDA mission is primarily to focus on supporting advanced stages of MCM development. However, novel treatments and/ or prophylactics at an advanced stage of development for an alternative indication but at an early phase of development as a medical countermeasure will be of considerable interest as well. Agents that can demonstrate a spectrum of use beyond that of the traditional broad spectrum antibiotics and act without overstimulation of cytokine production and are otherwise generally well tolerated are preferred. While the product profile of a drug or biologic in early phases of development may not be known early in the development process, a fully developed, licensable product should:<br /><br />&bull; Have an onset of action within 24 hours of an initial administration<br />&bull; Be indicated for use in adults, pediatrics, geriatrics and in special populations<br />&bull; Have minimal metabolic interactions with commonly prescribed drugs for the general population<br />&bull; Have a stable shelf life of 4-5 years<br /><br />Commercial utility outside of use as a medical countermeasure is also preferred. <br /><br /><strong>Data to be provided:<br /></strong><br />Data from this RFI will assist BARDA in assessing the viability of research and development of antimicrobial agents not focused on specific pathogens and thereby enhancing the nation's biodefense efforts.<br /><br />In Vitro data are acceptable as demonstration of the viability of an approach though results from animal models would be preferred. Data obtained from human clinical trials are welcomed though not required. All in vitro and in vivo data submitted in response to this RFI should be accompanied by a brief summary of findings as well as the description of the model(s) used. Additional data including chemical or immunological characteristics, mechanism of action, proposed formulation and dosage as well as scale of manufacture are welcome. <br /><br />Responders to this RFI may also describe institutional expertise and experience.<br /><br />This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Government. The Government does not intend to make any contract award on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or for the Government's use of such information. Acknowledgment of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the Government's evaluation of the information received. However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to this request for information or the Government's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement. All responses will be treated as confidential. Any proprietary information should be so marked.<br /><br /><strong>Inquiries<br /></strong><br />Information must be received by no later than the close of business <strong>18 June 2013</strong>. Responses should be limited to 10 pages and marked with RFI Number: RFIFY2013. Responses are to be electronic only and shall be emailed to the following Point of Contact:<br /><br />Ethan J. Mueller, Contracting Officer, HHS/OS/ASPR/AMCG<br />Office: 301-696-7289, Cell: 202-450-9878 <br />Email: Ethan.Mueller@HHS.gov<br /><br />In addition, please electronically submit any questions that you have regarding this RFI to the Point of Contact above by no later than 10 calendar days after the posting date of this RFI. If the due date falls on a non-business day then the due date shall be the close of business the next business day.<br /><br />The Government will plan on posting all questions and answers on a non-attribution basis as quickly as possible after the question due date.</p>

<DESC>UPDATE 4/19/2013 UPLOADING AMENDMENT 2<br />UPDATE 4/16/2013 UPLOADING AMENDMENT 1<br />UPDATE 4/5/2013 UPLOADING ATTACHMENT 14 IT WORKSHEETS, WHICH ARE PART OF THE RFP.<br />==<br />The Center for Mental Health Services and Center for Substance Abuse Prevention, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Department of Health and Human Services, has a requirement to award a one year cost reimbursement contract with four option years entitled "Tribal Training and Technical Assistance Center" Reference No. 280-13-0406. This project is competitive under the 8(a) program under NAICS Code 541990. This acquisition is subject to the availability of funds. The purpose of this project is to provide comprehensive broad, focused, and/or intensive training and technical assistance (TTA) to federally-recognized tribes and other American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN/) communities, seeking to address and prevent mental and substance use disorders, suicide, and promote mental health. This contract shall use a culturally relevant, evidence-based, holistic approach to support native communities in their self-determination efforts through infrastructure development, capacity building, as well as program planning and implementation. The TTA contractor shall specifically provide proactive planning/implementation of substance abuse prevention and mental health programming focused on native children, youth, and their families to (1) decrease the impact of risk factors, such as poverty, unemployment, racism and historical trauma that contribute to suicide, family disruption, youth violence including bullying, and high-risk substance use, and (2) increase the protective factors, such as strengthening cultural identity, a sense of family and community connectedness, and communication skills, that are linked to the healthy and safe development of AI/AN children and their families. Through collaboration and coordination with internal and external TTA providers and other native-focused organizations, the contract shall get the best value for limited prevention resources, tailoring the tools necessary to increase community protective factors that can serve to reduce suicide, violence, and substance abuse.<br />The focus of this contract is to address and prevent mental and substance use disorders, suicide, and promote mental health in native communities and families by providing culturally relevant and meaningful TTA that honors tribal culture and ways of life as well as respects and protects government-to-government relations. Native populations have the knowledge, capacity, and strength to address the risk factors that affect their communities. Cultural beliefs and practices provide a foundation for taking action, solving problems, and promoting lasting wellness among tribal communities, families, and youth. By supporting the local vision and solutions, protective factors will be increased. <br />The estimated date for issuance of the RFP is March 20, 2013 with proposal responses due April 22, 2013. The solicitation may be obtained by any of three ways: by mail; picked up in person at 1 Choke Cherry Road, Room 7-1065, Rockville, MD 20857; or electronically by downloading a file from FedBizOpps. If you have a continuing interest in the RFP, notify the individuals identified below that you wish copies of amendments to the RFP (if any) sent to you. Requests for copies of the RFP must be made in writing. Requests will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis until the supply is exhausted; however, there is no assurance that copies requested after the twentieth day will reach the requestor before the due date for receipt of responses. Requests shall be forwarded to the attention of Sophia Janus, Contract Specialist, Division of Contracts Management, OFR, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, DHHS, 1 ChokeCherry Road, Room 7-1065, Rockville, MD 20857. Requests may be sent via Fax to (240)276-1510. Electronic mail and telephone requests will not be honored. <br />

<AWARDEE>AVISCO, INC., 1005 CLARENCE LARSEN DR, OAK RIDGE, TN 37830-0000 US
<DESC>The Nashville District U.S. Army Corps of Engineers awarded a construction contract for the Phase II Construction and Potable Waterline Relocation of Bear Creek Road (BCR) in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. This is the notice of award.
<p>PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The relocation of BCR will tie in to the recently completed roadway on the east in the vicinity of the west end of the Polaris Parking Lot and, on the west, will tie-in to the existing Bear Creek Road just before the intersection with Old Bear Creek Road. The relocated BCR will be an urban-collector type road, compliant with Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT) standards. The road will have 12-foot lanes (one in each direction) with a 10-foot-wide utility shoulder on the south side and an 18-foot-wide utility shoulder on the north.</p>
<p>A precast concrete beam bridge will be erected so BCR will pass over the haul road to prevent traffic into the Y-12 Complex from being interrupted or delayed by trucks on the haul road. The overpass will provide minimum vertical clearance of 20 feet, and the lower road will have a minimum width clearance of 45 feet for the full length.</p>
<p>The BCR relocation scope consists of:<br />Roadway construction, including overpass<br />Tie-in to BCR eastern section<br />Tie-in on the west just before the intersection of existing BCR and Old Bear Creek Road<br />Steel casing for future duct bank crossing<br />Drainage structures (including 3 retention ponds and storm drains)<br />Safety appurtenances (i.e., guardrails, etc.)<br />Signs and pavement marking<br />Spur under the overpass with a base course of asphalt and temporary lane markings and signs<br />Signalization, as determined by a study</p>
<p>Construction of 4,000 feet of a City of Oak Ridge 24-in diameter waterline and ~3,600 feet of a plant 16-in diameter waterline, are part of the road construction. The new reinstalled potable water lines will parallel the relocated Bear Creek Road. The 24-in line will be installed in the 18-foot utility shoulder on the north side of the road, while the 16-in line, which will reduce to 12 inches, will be installed in the 10-foot shoulder on the south side. Installation will include new valve vaults in addition to use of existing valve vaults. Installation also includes electrical service for motor-operated valves and flow event date messaging; duct banks will be installed for lines and cables, and an existing control panel will be relocated and a new control panel installed. Although these waterlines and associated power will be installed in this WBS element, tie-ins to the City of Oak Ridge and Y-12 potable water systems, as well as electrical tie-ins will occur in a following phase of work.</p>
<p>NAICS CODE AND SBA SIZE STANDARD: The NAICS code for this project is 237310 with a size standard of $33,500,000.</p>
<p>PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS: Offerors were invited to submit a proposal subject to Project Labor Agreement (PLA) requirements (a PLA proposal), a proposal not subject to PLA requirements, or both. A PLA proposal was accepted by USACE. The awardee is required to execute a Project Labor Agreement (PLA) with one or more appropriate labor organizations for the term of the Contract.</p>
<p>TYPE OF SET-ASIDE: The solicitation was unrestricted to obtain full and open competition.</p>
<p>SOLICITATION AND CONTRACT TYPE: The Government used Best Value Trade-off Source Selection Procedures to award one Firm-Fixed Price Construction Contract.</p>
<p>SOLICITATION RELEASE DATE: The solicitation was released on 2 November 2012. The plans and technical specifications were made available at that time.</p>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL 
FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

1.  Contracting Activity:	Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
                                         	Office of Acquisition Operations
     	Technology Acquisition Center
     	260 Industrial Way West
     	Eatontown, New Jersey 07724
      		
	
2.  Description of Action: The proposed sole source action is for a six-month, Firm-Fixed Price contract modification, inclusive of options, to Contract VA118-13-C-0007, for Local Exchange Carrier services, henceforth referred to as telephone services, currently installed and used by the VA New York/New Jersey Veterans Healthcare Network including all community based outpatient clinics (CBOC's) and support facilities in Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) 3, which is part of Region 4. This modification will contain six, one-month options to be exercised at the Government's discretion to continue providing seamless coverage in the event the regional contract award is further delayed. The subject contract was awarded to Verizon Business Network Services Inc., 22001 Loudon County Parkway, Ashburn, VA 20147. 

3.  Description of the Supplies or Services: The purpose of this proposed modification is to provide a bridge between the current contract providing VISN 3 telephone services and the follow on effort which shall be solicited on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website under full and open competition.  The telephone services Contractor must provide transmission facilities, equipment, materials, maintenance, test equipment, and design layout needed to perform and provide local access and transport services and functions for the New York/New Jersey VISN 3 Network.  This includes any special items, equipment, wiring or infrastructure to ensure the Contractor's solution is compatible with the Government's infrastructure.  The Contractor is responsible for troubleshooting and maintaining the operation of the circuit up to its termination point.  Access to the local exchange shall include: operator assistance, directory assistance, and emergency 911/E911 services and functions.  REDACTED

4.  Authority: The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C.3304(a)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1 entitled, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."
 
5.  Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above: Telephone services to VISN 3 are currently provided by Verizon Business Network Services Inc.  In May of 2012, VA identified the need to regionalize phone services for economies and efficiencies to reduce recurring costs.  A decision was made to solicit the requirement for all of Region 4 (to include VISN 3) on FBO under full and open competition.  As requirements for the regional contract were developed to further promote competition, delays occurred which extended the possible cutover date for the VISN 3 telephone service.  VA needs to ensure telephone service to all facilities including CBOC's and support facilities in VISN 3 is uninterrupted.  Local telephone exchange service is vital for VISN 3 to allow communications which enhance patient care as well as to facilitate emergency responses.  These facilities throughout VA New York/New Jersey provide direct patient care and cannot lose telecommunication services.  Any lapse in service will have a profoundly negative effect on VISN 3's telecommunication lifeline.  Transition from the existing provider to another vendor would take time and could not be complete by the need date; therefore a contract modification is required. 

6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition: REDACTED

7.  Actions to Increase Competition: All future requirements will be transferred to the regional contract upon its award.

8.  Market Research:  REDACTED

9.  Other Facts: This effort is purely to ensure continuous phone service to VISN 3 between the expiration of the current contract and the award of the fully competed regional contract.

<DESC>The Department of the Interior, Interior Business Center (IBC) - Acquisition Services Directorate (AQD) on behalf of the National Science Foundation (NSF), Office of Inspector General (OIG) plans to contract by means other than full and open competition. This document sets forth the justification and approval for award of a Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) on a limited source basis as required by FAR 8.405-6.
<p>The action being approved is for audit services using data analytics for a firm fixed price task order. The order is a logical follow-on to order / GST1111BJ7023 awarded competitively to Withum Smith + Brown (WSB) on 08/05/2011 against GSA Schedule # GS-23F-0004U.</p>
<p>Under order GS-23F-0004U / GST1111BJ7023, the National Science Foundation Office of Inspector General (NSF OIG) engaged WSB to provide audit services using data analytics to support two NSF OIG audits, the University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB) and the University of California Davis (UC Davis). The objective of these audits was to determine if the costs claimed by these two Universities on their NSF awards for the period January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2010 were allocable, allowable, reasonable, and in conformity<br />with NSF award terms and conditions and applicable Federal award requirements. For these audits, WSB supported the NSF-OIG's audit by providing data analytics services (e.g., for each data set, searching for duplicate entries; utilizing Benford's law; analyzing burn rates for expenses for end of grants periods and grant extension periods; reviewing outliers from stratified expense categories; comparing employee information to payroll, vendor and participant support expenditure entries; comparing University employee and vendor lists to suspension and debarment lists, etc.) in order to discern anomalies, outliers, and aberrant transactions which appeared to represent unallowable, unallocable, and/or unreasonable costs charged to UCAL's NSF awards. WSB also assisted the NSF OIG with testing these<br />aberrant transactions during audit field work to determine if such claimed costs were in fact allowable, allocable, and reasonable. The contractor provided two senior-level auditors for this effort.</p>
