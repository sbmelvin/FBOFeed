This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all interest received on or before May 15, 2019, 8:00 AM, Central Time will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

The Point of Contact for this action is Sandra M. Norton, Sandra.norton@va.gov.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

<p>Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.

Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during any "Open Period".</p>
<p>The Open Period is the 1st through the 7th of each month, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST. Refer to AAAP RLP paragraph 3.02.A for more details on the offer submission process. The Government reserves the right to allow for multiple Open Periods prior to selecting an offer for award to meet this specific space requirement.  Offers cannot be submitted during the Closed Period (8th through the end of each month) and will not be considered for projects executed during that time period.</p>
<p>This FBO advertisement is hereby incorporated into the RLP 19-REG03 by way of reference as an RLP attachment.</p>
<p>Lease award will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the requirements in this FBO advertisement and in the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website.

The Lease and all documents that constitute the Lease package can be found at https://aaap.gsa.gov.</p>
<p>* If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2018, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2019 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually. Please be sure to review FY19 AAAP RLP Package and each page within the AAAP Application prior to submitting your offer as some of the questions have changed. You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP. Your previous offered space will not be copied.</p>
