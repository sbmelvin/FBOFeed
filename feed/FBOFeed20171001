<DESC>NOTICE: The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 9 months before your offer is reviewed.

GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs. In order for your offer to be considered under any of these unique circumstances, you should submit detailed customer correspondence and any other supporting documentation that fully explains all factors involved.



Description:

This is a standing solicitation for Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) 36 Office, Imaging and Document Solutions. This solicitation will be available electronically-only and includes all current applicable clauses. Interested parties may access the solicitation at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov.

Prospective contractors are required to complete and maintain electronic annual representations and certifications in the Online Representations and Certifications Application (SAM) database (http://sam.gov). Contractors are not eligible for an award, if such information is not current.

Resulting Contracts will be effective for a 5-year period beginning Date of Award and include an option to extend for three additional 5-year periods. Certified 8(a) firms can participate in the MAS Program. Submission of products with environmental attributes is encouraged.

You may find more information about this program at various online sites, including GSA Advantage! (www.gsaadvantage.gov), Schedules e-Library (www.gsaelibrary.gsa.gov) and the Vendor Support Center (VSC) http://vsc.gsa.gov.

For more information on FEMA's ADR services, please contact FEMA's ADR office at the following address: 500 C Street SW, Washington, DC 20472.  If concerns cannot be resolved, protesters may use these procedures when a resolution is requested from the agency.  These procedures have been designed to create an avenue for resolving third party grievances in connection with the acquisition process outside of formal processes through the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the United States Court of Federal Claims (CFC). Filing an agency protest is not a prerequisite to filing at the GAO or CFC. If the protester files a protest through the GAO or CFC while their protest is pending at the agency level, FEMA may dismiss the agency protest.  Pursuing an agency protest does not extend the time for obtaining a stay at GAO. These procedures are in addition to the existing protest procedures contained in FAR Subpart 33.103.<BR><BR>B.	Definitions.
(1)	"Agency protest," as used in this SOP, is one that may be filed with either the Contracting Officer or the officer responsible for the resolution of all agency protests filed at the level above the Contracting Officer.
(2)	"Ombudsman," as used in this SOP, is the agency official above the level of the Contracting Officer designated by the Director of the Acquisition Management Division to handle and issue the formal agency decision resolving the protest.	Protesters using these procedures may protest directly to the Ombudsman.
(3)	"Day," as used in this SOP, is a calendar day. In computing a period of time for the purpose of these procedures, the day from which the period begins to run is not counted. When the last day of the period is a Saturday, Sunday or a Federal holiday, the period extends to the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or a Federal holiday.  Similarly, when the Washington, DC offices of FEMA are closed for all or part of the last day, the period extends to the next day on which the Agency is open.

C.	Submission Guidelines.
(1)	Agency protests may be filed through the Contracting Officer or, at the level above the Contracting Officer, through the Ombudsman either by FAX transmission or by "Certified Mail" (Return Receipt Requested) as follows:
a.	Protests filed through the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman must be mailed to FEMA DR-4332-TX
Attn: Mr. Sherwin C. Turner
Contracting Officer 
11000 N. Interstate 35
Austin, TX 78753

-OR-

OCPO
Attn: David Orris Building D, Room 123
16825 South Seton Avenue Emmitsburg, MD 21727
b.	The outside of the envelope or beginning of the FAX transmission must be marked "Agency Protest".
c.	If the protester submits the protest directly through the Ombudsman, the protester must also, within one (1) day of submitting the protest to the Ombudsman, submit a copy of the protest to the responsible Contracting Officer either by FAX transmission or by "Certified Mail" (Return Receipt Requested).
(2)	) To be filed on a given day, protests and any subsequent appeals must be received by 4:30 PM, current-local time. Any protests received after that time will be considered to be filed on the next day.
(3)	Protest submissions will not be considered filed until all of the following information is provided:
a.	the protester's name, address, telephone number and fax number;
b.	the solicitation or contract number;
c.	a detailed statement of all factual and legal grounds for protests, to include an explanation of how the protester was prejudiced;
d.	copies of relevant documents;
e.	a request for ruling by the agency;
f.	a statement detailing the form of relief requested;
g.	all information establishing that the protester is an interested party for the purposes of filing a protest; and
h.	all information establishing the timeliness of the protest.
(4)	All protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester, and must be addressed to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman.<BR><BR>D.	Timeliness/Resolution of Protests.
(1)	Protests based upon alleged improprieties in a solicitation which are apparent prior to bid opening or the time set for receipt of initial proposals shall be filed prior to bid opening or the time set for receipt of initial proposals. In procurements where proposals are requested, alleged improprieties which do not exist in the initial solicitation but which are subsequently incorporated into the solicitation must be protested not later than the next closing time for receipt of proposals following the incorporation.
(2)	Protests other than those covered by paragraph (1) of this section shall be filed not later than 10 days after the basis of protest is known or should have been known (whichever is earlier), with the exception of protests challenging a procurement conducted on the basis of competitive proposals under which a debriefing is requested and, when requested, is required. In such cases, with respect to any protest basis which is known or should have been known either before or as a result of the debriefing, the initial protest shall not be filed before the debriefing date offered to the protester, but shall be filed not later than 10 days after the date on which the debriefing is held.
(3)	Protests filed through the Contracting Officer.
a.	Within twenty (20) days after the protest is filed through the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will send a written ruling and a summary of the reasons supporting the ruling to the protester by "Certified Mail (Return Receipt Requested)".
b.	Appeals
i.	Protesters who filed protests through the Contracting Officer may, within five (5) days of receipt of the Contracting Officer's written ruling, appeal to the Ombudsman.
ii.	Requests for Appellate Review must be submitted to the Ombudsman by FAX transmission or by "Certified Mail" (Return Receipt Requested).
iii.	The Ombudsman will send a written ruling and a summary of the reasons supporting the ruling to the protester by "Certified Mail (Mail Receipt Requested)" within ten (10) days of receipt of the request for appellate review of the Contracting Officer's decision.
iv.	In accordance with FAR 33.103(d) (4) and 4 C.F.R 21.2(a) (3), if there is an agency appellate review of the Contracting Officer's decision on the protest, it will not extend GAO'S timeliness requirements. Therefore, any subsequent protest to the GAO must be filed within ten (10) days of knowledge of initial adverse agency action.
(4)	Protests filed through the Ombudsman:
a.	If the protester protests directly through the Ombudsman, the Ombudsman will send a written ruling and a summary of the reasons supporting the ruling to the protester by "Certified Mail (Mail Receipt Requested)" within thirty-five (35) days after the protest was filed.
b.	Protests filed directly through the Ombudsman cannot be appealed within the agency.<BR><BR>E.	Dismissal of Protests.
The agency may dismiss protests when protesters file protests through the GAO or CFC while their protests are pending at the agency level; and for failure to comply with any of the requirements of these agency protest procedures. For example, the agency may dismiss protests that are procedurally or substantively defective (e.g., the protest is untimely or the protest fails).<BR><BR>

OFOC SOP Revision 05   Page 1 of 2
Original Date: 03/22/11
Revision 05 Date: 05/02/2016
JUSTIFICATION FOR SINGLE SOURCE AWARDS IAW FAR 13.106-1
(OVER MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD($3.5K) BUT NOT EXCEEDING THE SAT ($150K))
IAW FAR13.104, COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. When competition is not practicable, IAW FAR13.106-1(b), COs solicit from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.  COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3),COs are required to include additional statements explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source) or supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier.  This template when completed can be used to document single source awards IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3).  Note: Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.  
1. ACQUISITION PLAN ACTION ID: 
618-18-1-4008-0003
1A. PROJECT/TASK No.
1B. ESTIMATED AMOUNT: $29,980
2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE:

Fixed price sole source purchase order for Full Service Maintenance Agreement on the Provation software, GIGast-L1 Large, MulitCare Gast-L2, DSS Vista Gast-S1, for the clinical department for the period 10/1/2017 through 9/30/2018.  The service contract shall include a base year and four subsequent option years.

SCOPE:  Provation shall provide all support maintenance for the Minneapolis VA for the Provation software, GIGast-L1 Large, MulitCare Gast-L2, DSS Vista Gast-S1.

Services provided under this standard service agreement include:
Correction of reported failures. 
Furnishing new modules and versions, revisions, updates or upgrades.
Provision of telephone support and/or remote access support to assist VA in its use of the ProVation software.

CONTRACT PERIOD:  Contract base period shall begin 10/1/2017 and end on 9/30/2018, with the option of exercising four option years.  The Owner will have the option to end the contract by notifying Provation in writing at least 60 days prior to desired contract termination.  

QUALIFICATIONS:  All support of the Provation software covered by this agreement shall be performed by Provation.


3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:

This service is proprietary to the manufacturer, Provation.   Provation is the only vendor qualified or able to provide service on the Provation software because of proprietary data rights.
4. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
In the future if other vendors are available to provide the required parts and services we will contact them.

5. Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. Note: COs are required to make a determination of price reasonableness IAW FAR 13.106-3.  See the Commercial Supply and Service SOP for Price Reasonableness templates.
