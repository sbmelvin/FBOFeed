<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) for project planning purposes only.  No formal solicitation for this work exists at this time.  The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) is seeking information from industry to be used for the development of specifications and the Statement of Work (SOW) for the repair and replacement of the trash racks at Parker Dam.
The Parker Dam power plant is located near the left abutment of the Dam facing upstream.  Water flows to the power plant and passes through a fore bay inlet trash rack structure into an excavated fore bay channel, and then through the penstock intakes which is equipped with individual trash racks.  None of the existing trash racks have provisions for regular cleaning.  	
The accumulation of current and expected debris will increase alongside with the infestation of quagga mussels and aquatic plant life.  As a result, the need of a trash rake cleaner is required at the forebay inlet structure which will provide the necessary requirements to; execute in cleaning the trash racks bars by removing accumulated quagga mussels/aquatic plants, alleviate low flow velocities, and retrieve collected debris.  Debris removal will be most effective at this location.
The existing trash rack roadway is 236 feet-long, 12 feet 4 inches wide and with a maximum weight load of 10 tons.   The trash rack structure is comprised of 12 bays, each section have two sets of trash racks.  Each section is 61 feet high and 8 feet in width.  A 24 inch concrete wall separates each trash rack section.  There are 16 trash bars for each rack, measuring at 6" x ?" and evenly spaced at 5 inches.  Interested parties may include, but are not limited to, vendors and both commercial and government customers.  A draft sketch, drawings, photographs, and a list of materials for the trash racks will be provided upon request.

<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology (hereinafter referred to as "Technology"). License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research or CRADA program.
<p>The patent-pending Technology relates to methods for treating irradiated nuclear fuel that represent improvements over the conventional PUREX process. It has been demonstrated that irradiated nuclear fuel can be dissolved readily at room temperature in a non-corrosive and low-hazard solution of ammonium carbonate and hydrogen peroxide. The uranium dissolves completely with most of the plutonium and fission products remaining behind as an insoluble heel; this separates the uranium from plutonium and the majority of the radioactivity at the initial dissolution step. Uranium can be easily recovered from solution by any of several means, such as ion exchange, solvent extraction, or direct precipitation. Other useful elements may be extracted from the mixture as well. The ammonium carbonate can be evaporated out of solution and recovered for re-use, leaving an extremely compact volume of fission products mixed with transuranic elements. Stack emissions using the Technology are less toxic, less radioactive, chemically simpler, and simpler to treat than those from the PUREX process.</p>
<p>Note: THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT. Any company interested in licensing the Technology must respond with a Letter of Interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than 45 days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company's business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity. Companies deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the Technology. Such information may require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement. Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a commercial license will be required to submit a business plan for the commercialization of the Technology prior to licensee(s) selection and negotiations. Please send letters of interest to the attention of the POC indentified within this Notice.</p>
<p>Please include the above SOL (Solicitation No.) in your reply</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC><p>AETC CONS/LGCT seeks to identify, and obtain information from, responsible sources in connection with the privatization of the electrical distribution system (NAICS 221122) at Hanscom AFB, MA. Privatization is defined as the conveyance of a utility system to a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or other entity. The conveyance may consist of all right, title, and interest of the United States in the utility system. Utility Privatization (UP) will be accomplished in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2688 Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority.</p>
<p>Contractor will be required to assume ownership of the electrical distribution system at Hanscom AFB, MA and as the new owner, shall operate and maintain the system and provide utility services to the Government. Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, management, supervision, permits, equipment, supplies, materials, transportation, and any other incidental items or services required for the complete ownership of and provision of utility services via these utility systems, including operation, maintenance, repair, upgrades, and improvements to the utility systems.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought Notice (hereinafter "Notice") is an essential step in determining market interest and feasibility. Responses received will be used to develop marketing strategies for the potential privatization of utilities at this installation. Should interest be determined sufficient, a formal solicitation may be forthcoming. Interested parties should provide a statement of interest on company letterhead by no later than 4:00 pm CST on September 15, 2009. Responses are preferred via e-mail, but hard copies and facsimiles will also be accepted.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">At a minimum, the statement of interest shall address:</span></strong> (1) capability and experience in utility privatization or owning and operating utility systems; (2) financial capability to justify potential award of such a contract; (3) a primary point of contact, including phone number and e-mail address; (4) an indication of the size of the business (large, small, or any sub-category of small business), and (5) for large businesses only an opinion on subcontracting possibilities with small and/or small, disadvantaged businesses. The potential opportunity for set-asides for small businesses and small disadvantaged businesses will be considered on the basis of the responses received.</p>
<p>This Notice is solely for the Government's use as a market research tool. As such, the issuance of a competitive solicitation is not guaranteed. If determined appropriate, then both a synopsis and a solicitation may be anticipated in the February-March 2010 timeframe. All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a response to this Notice. All information received will be considered. Failure to respond to this Notice does not preclude a firm from offering on any resultant solicitation; however, a lack of interest in this requirement may keep this effort from moving forward competitively.</p>
<p>This announcement shall not be construed as a commitment or authorization to incur costs in anticipation of an award. The Government is not bound to make any awards under this Notice.</p>
<p>If you are interested in this project, please provide the information requested above to the AETC/LGCT Contracting Office.</p>
<p><strong>Hanscom AFB, MA Electrical Distribution System:</strong> Hanscom AFB electrical service is provided at 14.4-kilovolts (kV) through three sets of 500-thousand-circular-mill (kcmil or MCM) EPR cables to the Base substation. At the Base perimeter, near the Small Business Office (Building 1100) and the former Phillips Laboratory Gate (Gate 3), a manhole is located where responsibility for the electrical system shifts from NSTAR, the transmission and distribution (T&amp;D) provider, and Transcanada, the commodity provider, to Hanscom AFB.</p>
<p>From the manhole at the Base perimeter, the circuits are routed through an underground duct bank to the Base&rsquo;s main substation. This substation serves as the main power distributor for the entire Base. That portion of the substation where the main incoming and feeder breakers are housed is made up of a section of walk in metal enclosed switchgear. This is where the Electric Utility owned revenue meters are located. The switchgear main bus is rated for 2,000 A at 15 kV. The main incoming NSTAR lines and bus tie circuit breakers are rated 2,000 amperes (A) and the feeder breakers are rated 1,200 A, all at 15 kV. The switchgear is arranged in a four bus configuration with an incoming feed serving each of three of the four buses with tie breakers between adjacent buses. Each of the four buses has three feeder breakers for serving load. Spaces for three spare breakers are available on Bus No. 2 and 3 to allow for future expansion. From the main bus, three breakers feed the three 3,750-kV amperes (kVA), 14.4- to 4160/2520-V power transformers located in the substation. One of the transformers feeds the former Phillips Laboratory and part of the former Rome Laboratory area. A second (newest) transformer serves the on-Base steam and chilled water plant. The third transformer is used as a spare transformer and may be used to backup either of the two utilized transformers. Switching arrangements are available to shift loads and services among all three transformers. From the main bus, five distribution circuits feed the remainder of the Base.</p>
<p>All primary feed is contained within concrete encased conduit, 75% of which under pavement.</p>
<p>The Hanscom AFB electric distribution system is currently monitored by fault indicator equipment at 73 total locations throughout the main base. Fault indicator equipment is connected to the EMCS system on the electric distribution wiring. The SCADA system reads the substation. Equipment is monitored at the computer in the Exterior Electric Shop, Building 1817. A SCADA system reads the substation.</p>
<p>NSTAR is the transportation and distribution provider and Transcanada is the commodity provider that supplies power to the Fourth Cliff Family Recreational Area through a single service at the main entrance.</p>
<p>National Grid supplies power to the Sagamore Hill Air Weather Services Facility through a tap from the 4.16-kilovolt (kV) distribution feeder on Sagamore Street. Located at the feeder tap are the metering facilities and riser pole transition down to the government-owned underground circuit that feeds up the hill and into the station. Government ownership of the electric facilities starts at the load side of the air break switch located at the metering facilities along Sagamore Street.</p>
<p>The Town of Hudson&rsquo;s Office of the Light and Power Department supplies power to the Sudbury Geophysics Research Annex through one overhead service to the facility. Government ownership of the electric facilities starts at the load side of the primary metering pole along Hudson Road.</p>

<DESC><p>AETC CONS/LGCT seeks to identify, and obtain information from, responsible sources in connection with the privatization of the water distribution system (NAICS 221310) at Hanscom AFB, MA. Privatization is defined as the conveyance of a utility system to a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or other entity. The conveyance may consist of all right, title, and interest of the United States in the utility system. Utility Privatization (UP) will be accomplished in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2688 Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority.
<p>Contractor will be required to assume ownership of the water distribution system at Hanscom AFB, MA and as the new owner, shall operate and maintain the system and provide utility services to the Government. Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, management, supervision, permits, equipment, supplies, materials, transportation, and any other incidental items or services required for the complete ownership of and provision of utility services via these utility systems, including operation, maintenance, repair, upgrades, and improvements to the utility systems.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought Notice (hereinafter "Notice") is an essential step in determining market interest and feasibility. Responses received will be used to develop marketing strategies for the potential privatization of utilities at this installation. Should interest be determined sufficient, a formal solicitation may be forthcoming. Interested parties should provide a statement of interest on company letterhead by no later than 4:00 pm CST on September 15, 2009. Responses are preferred via e-mail, but hard copies and facsimiles will also be accepted.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>At a minimum, the statement of interest shall address:</strong></span> (1) capability and experience in utility privatization or owning and operating utility systems; (2) financial capability to justify potential award of such a contract; (3) a primary point of contact, including phone number and e-mail address; (4) an indication of the size of the business (large, small, or any sub-category of small business), and (5) for large businesses only an opinion on subcontracting possibilities with small and/or small, disadvantaged businesses. The potential opportunity for set-asides for small businesses and small disadvantaged businesses will be considered on the basis of the responses received.</p>
<p>This Notice is solely for the Government's use as a market research tool. As such, the issuance of a competitive solicitation is not guaranteed. If determined appropriate, then both a synopsis and a solicitation may be anticipated in the February-March 2010 timeframe. All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a response to this Notice. All information received will be considered. Failure to respond to this Notice does not preclude a firm from offering on any resultant solicitation; however, a lack of interest in this requirement may keep this effort from moving forward competitively.</p>
<p>This announcement shall not be construed as a commitment or authorization to incur costs in anticipation of an award. The Government is not bound to make any awards under this Notice.</p>
<p>If you are interested in this project, please provide the information requested above to the AETC/LGCT Contracting Office.</p>
</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Hanscom AFB, MA Water Distribution System:<br /></strong></span>The Hanscom AFB water distribution system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the distribution system from the point in which the distribution system enters the Installation and Government ownership currently starts to the point of demarcation, defined by the Right of Access. The utility system is composed of, without limitation, valves, fire hydrants, water distribution mains, meters, and storage tanks. The actual inventory of items sold will be in the bill of sale at the time the system is transferred. The following description and inventory is included to provide the Contractor with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the distribution system. The Government makes no representation that the inventory is accurate. The Contractor shall base its proposal on site inspections, information in the technical library, other pertinent information, and to a lesser degree the following description and inventory. <br />Specifically excluded from the water distribution system privatization are:<br />&bull; Approximately 6,800 linear feet of cast iron piping owned by the U.S. Navy.<br />&bull; Hanscom AFB Military Family Housing water distribution<br />&bull; Mobile Home Park remaining water distribution system<br />&bull; Ipswich Antenna Test Facility<br />The Town of Lexington provides 95 percent of the potable water supply to Hanscom AFB through three metered connections:<br />&bull; Hartwell Avenue connection - located where the Hanscom AFB 8-inch main connects to the Town of Lexington main at the Town of Lexington-owned meter on Hartwell Avenue. <br />&bull; Wright Street connection - located where the Hanscom AFB 10-inch main, located within a 50-foot wide easement through an off-Base housing development, connects to the Town of Lexington-owned meter near Katahdin Hill on Wright Street. <br />&bull; Wood Street Emergency connection - this connection is made through a normally closed 8-inch main on Wood Street which connects to the Town of Lexington owned meter connection, which is approximately 100 feet southeast of its intersection with Hartwell Avenue. <br />The remaining 5 percent of potable water supplied to the Base serves the trailer park and Family Camp area located north of Massport's L.G. Hanscom Airport. The trailer park is served by the Town of Bedford through a meter owned by the Air Force; the Family Camp area is served by the Town of Lexington through an Air Force-owned meter. <br />Hanscom AFB, as well as both towns, receive their water from the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA). The Town of Lexington and the Town of Bedford provide water at separate locations on the installation which are not connected and are separately metered. Hanscom AFB holds a 1996 Certificate of Registration (PWS ID# 3023002) from the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) Division of Water Supply as a registered public water supplier in Massachusetts. The Towns of Lexington and Bedford, which supply the water, provide water quality monitoring. MWRA provides disinfection. The Base has discontinued the use of its hypochlorite injection disinfection systems this is because of the stability of the disinfection approach where the water system generally contains approximately 2 milligrams per liter (mg/L) of available chlorine. Hanscom AFB currently provides no additional disinfection for the water system.<br />The water supply pressure from the City is too high for standard municipal service and, therefore, is reduced for use on the Base at two pressure reducing valve stations which then provide adequate water pressure on Base. As noted above, the Base can supplement the disinfection provided by the Town of Lexington to the main Base, if necessary, with three onsite chlorination systems, but discontinued their use in January 2001.<br />The average depth of the buried pipe at Hanscom AFB is approximately six to eight feet.<br />The military family housing areas are not a part of the system to be privatized. Military family housing connects to the Hanscom AFB installation main at six locations: <br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Military Family Housing POD #1</span> is at the downstream connection to main water valve (MWV) 46A. This is the connection of the Military Family Housing 8" main with the Hanscom AFB main. This is located at the center of Vandenburg drive, near BLDG 1630.<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Military Family Housing POD #2</span> is at the downstream connection to MWV 146, this is the connection of the 10" Hanscom AFB main from Marrett Road with the Military Family Housing main on Offutt Road. This is located where the system intersects with the Leased Area boundary.<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Military Family Housing POD #3</span> is at the downstream connection of MWV 93E, where the service lateral for Building 2001 leaves the Hanscom AFB main. This is located on Ent Road approximately 150 linear feet northeast of the intersection of Ent Road with Patterson Road.<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Military Family Housing POD #4</span> is at MWV 93B, located at the south east corner of the intersection of Patterson Road and Ent Road. Ownership does not include the valve.<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Military Family Housing POD #5</span> is at MWV 93A, located on Ent Road near the intersection with Patterson Road. Ownership does not include the valve.<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Military Family Housing POD#6</span> is at valve 1145, located near the intersection of Adams Road and Colonial Place. This POD is located to the south of Building 1994. Ownership includes the valve.<br />The City of Marshfield, through a cooperative agreement with the Town of Scituate, supplies potable water to the Fourth Cliff Family Recreation Area from a Town of Scituate main located near the facility gate. A Town of Scituate water meter, located near the connection, meters water consumption. The potable water distribution system serves cabins and other structures, and recreational vehicle (RV) hookups. <br />The Town of Hamilton supplies potable water to the Sagamore Hill Air Weather Services Facility from a Town main located near the gate. A Town water meter located at the main building meters water consumption. Water consumption is estimated to be less than 250 gallons per day (gpd).</p>

<p>The Hanscom AFB wastewater system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the collection system from the point of demarcation defined by the Right of Access. The system may include, but is not limited to, infrastructure identified in Table 1. The actual inventory of items sold will be in the bill of sale at the time the system is transferred. The following description and inventory is included to provide the UP Contractor with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the system. The Government makes no representation that the inventory is accurate. The UP Contractor shall base its proposal on site inspections, information in the technical library, other pertinent information, and to a lesser degree the following description and inventory. <br />Specifically excluded from the wastewater system privatization are:<br />&bull; oil water separators<br />&bull; grease traps<br />&bull; storm sewers<br />&bull; groundwater treatment system<br />&bull; former trailer park site<br />Wastewater generated by Hanscom AFB discharges into Town of Bedford by sanitary sewer main(s) via four (4) Town of Bedford owned manholes along the east side of the Base, after which it travels south to Town of Bedford's wastewater treatment plant. The Wastewater collection system is operated and maintained by Hanscom AFB. <br />The sanitary wastewater system at Hanscom AFB includes collection mains, two main pump stations, and one small pump station, each of which is described below. Wastewater is discharged to the Town of Bedford's sewer system. The Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) provides treatment for wastewater in the region. <br />The collection piping consists of vitrified clay, ductile iron, and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) piping. There are no wastewater treatment facilities on Base. The average depth of buried piping is approximately eight feet.<br />The Upper Main pump station (Building 1306) sewage pumping controls were upgraded in 1999. The pump station includes three pumps located in a below grade concrete dry well. The pumps draw from two wet wells that have a combined capacity of 250,000 gallons. The station is designed for two pumps, with one on stand-by. The Upper Main pump station pumps the Base's total sewage flow to the Town of Bedford's sewer force main through a new ductile iron pipe force main constructed in 1996 along Hartwell Avenue. The point of connection is at Route 2 with Bedford's force main; from there the flow continues on to the regional treatment facility owned by MWRA. There also is a Town of Bedford metered connection at the intersection of Wood Street and Hartwell Ave., which is used for emergency overflow only. <br />The Lower Main pump station (Building 1539) was rebuilt in 1987 and pumps upgraded in 1994. The Lower Main lift station includes three centrifugal pumps (two duty pumps plus a standby) located in a concrete dry well. The pumps draw from a wet well that has a maximum working capacity of approximately 7,500 gallons. One small lift station is also used to provide collection for Building 1101.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command, Joint Munitions & Lethality Contracting Center, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, on behalf of the Office of the Project Manager for Combat Ammunition Systems is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources capable of manufacturing and delivering one million three hundred thousand(1,300,000) M220 Propelling Charges.  Deliveries for the M220 propelling charges would need to begin March 2011 with a minimum required production capability of 160,000 units per month.   The M220 Propelling Charges consist of two (2) components:  a molded felted fiber nitrocellulose case (increment container) and (M38) ball powder propellant.  The propellant is loaded into the increment container and then sealed, which makes up the completed propelling charge.  The propelling charge is placed over the fin.  When the ignition cartridge is ignited, it flashes through the holes in the fin assembly and sets off the propellant charges.  The burning of the increment container and propellant produces the gas pressure to force the mortar cartridge out of the tube and down range.  The M220 propelling charge supports the M889A1/M889A2/M821A2 81mm high explosive cartridges and the M879 81mm full range practice cartridge.  Interested sources should demonstrate that they currently possess the experience and capability, necessary to fabricate, assemble and inspect the referenced quantities of propelling charges and deliver to Load Assembly and Pack facility prior to required date.  Interested sources should also possess the necessary equipment, facilities and tooling required to fabricate and deliver these propelling charges at a high rate of production.  Interested sources should also possess capability to obtain safety clearance to handle up to Hazard Class 1.3 explosives/hazardous components.  Interested firms should provide a summary of their companys capabilities including parent organizations, name/address/point of contact identification, capabilities, a description of facilities/equipment, manufacturing processes, inspection capability, personnel, past experience as a propelling charge manufacturer, proven monthly production capacity and/or potential capacity, possible partnering/teaming arrangements and whether the company is a large or small business.  The market survey is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government.  The Government will utilize information provided for planning purposes only.  All information submitted will be provided at no cost to the Government and will be held in confidential status.  The contractor shall provide all information requested in this notification within 10 days of this publication by electronic mail to Mark Zator at mark.zator@us.army.mil.

<DESC><p>This announcement serves as a <strong>Sources Sought&nbsp;Notice</strong> issued for the purpose of market research in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10. This Sources Sought is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation nor is this notice a Request for Proposals (RFP). The Department is <strong>NO</strong>T requesting a quote or proposal in response to this synopsis. This synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the government for any purpose. The Government does not intend to pay for information furnished pursuant to this RFI. The purpose for this Sources Sought announcement is to conduct market research to identify parties having an interest in, and the resources to support, this requirement. For the purpose of this acquisition, the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 336321 - Vehicular Lighting Equipment Manufacturing and the applicable size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>DLA Troop Support seeks your expression of interest and any suggestion regarding DLA Troop Support's desire to establish supply support of: <strong>7-inch round 12volt LED Headlamps (NSN 6220-01-575-9838).</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Component Information</span>: To retain standardization across all military vehicle systems,<strong> lamps are produced to Military Performance Specification, MIL-PRF-32243, March 12, 2009 (available via http://www.assistdocs.com)</strong>. MIL-PRF-32243 establishes the minimum requirements for engineering acceptance for the operation, performance, and reliability of what is commonly termed as the seven (7) inch round Forward Lighting Driving Headlamp, for military vehicles, with Light Emitting Diodes (LED) as the base of their technology for illumination and compliance with applicable SAE, United States FMVSS, Canadian CMVSS, MIL Standards and Military Performance Specifications. The lamps will be designed to conform to the photometry, mechanical, electrical and special performance requirements referenced within this document where applicable. Each production part need not be tested to the specified validation tests as proof of compliance. The headlamp may be supplied as a replacement part or as a component in a finished assembly.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Requirements</span>: Unless otherwise specified, the design, materials and manufacturing process selection is the prerogative of the contractor as long as all articles submitted to the Government fully meet the operating, interface, support and ownership, and environmental requirements specified.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Design and Construction</span>: Potential suppliers of external LED Military Vehicle Lighting Lamps shall be aware of form, fit and functional parameters so as to produce a part that shall be backwards compatible with previously produced vehicle lamps. Lamp assembly form, the wire leads length and connector types can be found on <strong>Drawing I (page 6 of MIL-PRF-32243).</strong></p>
<p><strong>The LED headlamp shall comply with all of the requirements listed in MIL-PRF-32243, and all referenced documents.</strong> <strong>The 7-inch round white LED headlamps must meet or exceed all applicable Department of Transportation (DOT) requirements and all federal motor vehicle safety standards.</strong> Any loss of function of the lamp or individual LED is considered a failure. Evidence of deformation, loss of seal, cracking or crazing that would prevent compliance to form, fit or function is considered a failure.</p>
<p>Each headlamp uses 10 LEDs as its light source. The color temperature of the assembly is around 5,000 degrees K. The 7-inch round LED headlamps run on 24-volt electrical systems. The Operating Temperature ranges from -50C to 70C, with an overvoltage spike protection of 600v. These solid state headlamps feature potted circuit board assemblies for unrivaled shock and vibration resistance and hard coated polycarbonate lenses that have 30 times more impact strength than glass. They are protected from the elements, thrown stones and debris, and other hazards due to their fully encapsulated design. The design provides moisture and vibration resistance, and the use of anodized aluminum and a hardened silicon-coated polycarbonate lenses enhances product durability. All electronics are fully sealed in epoxy, making lamps less susceptible to shock and vibration. With multiple diodes incorporated into its design, the lamp is also difficult to knock out completely from debris or small-arms fire.</p>
<p>LED lamps covered by this performance specification are intended primarily for the purpose of replacing current incandescent Headlamps. LED technology that is properly designed, is not vulnerable to shock and vibration and therefore performs much better in severe end-use environments. By converting incandescent lamp products to LED, the lamps often last the life of the vehicle thus eliminating maintenance and field service issues.</p>

<DESC>IRM/OPS/CSO (CSO) has a requirement to provide its FTE program management staff, including its division chiefs, branch chiefs, and team leads, with training to better understand today's work environment where performance-based IT service contracts are in use. Under the Department's IT Desktop Support Consolidation program, CSO has become responsible for one of the Department's largest performance-based services contracts that currently has a contractor staff of over 230 individuals. CSO FTE staff has been struggling to understand the new dynamic that places them in a Government oversight role and makes them responsible for the accomplishment of work but leaves them without the capability to individually direct all the work for which they retain responsibility. CSO requires a one-day, instructor led, on-site training course for a minimum of 15 and a maximum of 20 students that presents and discusses the issues, responsibilities, and risks of managing and operating in this type of mixed Government FTE and contractor workplace.

<CONTACT>Patty Matyskiela, Email patricia.matyskiela@darpa.mil
<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Strategic Technology Office (STO) intends to award a Sole Source contract to Materials Modification, Inc. (MMI) for a follow-on effort to the Lightweight Ceramic Armor Program to continue development and scale-up of the Plasma Pressure Compaction (P2C) ceramic consolidation technology and testing of ceramic-based body armor systems produced using this unconventional ceramic processing technique. MMI previously received a DARPA-funded contract for research and development related to their proprietary P2C system. The intended new effort will require MMI to further develop and demonstrate a unique procedure for producing high-density, curved ceramic plates up to 7" x 8" in size. The high-performance ceramic tiles will be integrated into a proprietary hybrid composite armor system and will be tested to meet Army ballistic specifications. The contractor will be required to demonstrate a consistent ceramic consolidation process featuring reduced time and temperature in comparison to conventional consolidation approaches. This scaled P2C system will allow for consolidation of both nano- and submicron-sized powders. MMI is the only source known to the Government with the requisite capabilities, facilities, and experiences to perform the follow-on Lightweight Ceramic Armor effort within the Government's cost and schedule constraints due to the proprietary nature of the novel P2C approach. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is currently available. However, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. Responses/proposals received within forty-five (45) days after date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for or award a contract. Point of contact for this synopsis is Patty Matyskiela, Contracting Officer, patricia.matyskiela@darpa.mil. See Note 22.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY<br />NO SOLICITAION WILL BE ISSUED AGAINST THIS SYNOPSIS</em></strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this Task Order 17 under EP-C-08-002 is funded for $100,000 to provide In-kind support to the United States Virgin Islands under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Modification 1 to the task order extends the anticipated period of performance for this task order. The revised final deliverable date is May 31, 2011. The primary objective of this task order is to assist EPA Region II in providing management tools in the areas of sanitary sewage, watershed planning, and green infrastructure for the US Virgin Islands:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) The sources of fecal coliform pollution are difficult to determine. US Virgin Islands Department of Planning and Natural Resources (DPNR) believes that failing septic systems contribute greatly to fecal coliform pollution. The task order will assist DPNR in investigating this possibility.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Rainfall and observed data statistics would provide insight to longer range watershed planning.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The Green Infrastructure task described in this Task Order is intended to target reduction in urban runoff and pollutant loadings by managing the runoff as close to its sources as possible.<br />The great majority of the work will be performed at the contractor's location in Watertown MA.</p>
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Water (OW) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OW contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OW contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

Medical Center
Description of Action: Procurement of ALICE PDX Device Kit RQ 672-11-1-103-0015
Description of Supplies or Services: Alice PDX Device Kit Portable Sleep Diagnostic Device.
Statutory Authority:  Far 6.302-1 (b) (4)
(x) (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements;
( ) (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency;
() (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability, or Expert Services;
( ) (4) International Agreement
( ) (5) Authorized or required by statute

1	Validity of Use of Statutory Authority:  When the agency head has
determined in accordance with the agency's standardization program that only specified makes and models of technical equipment and parts will satisfy the agency's needs for additional units or replacement items, and only one source is available.
Our diagnostic equipment is the Alice 5 from Respironics. The requested portable monitoring equipment is from Respironics. The idea is not to incur in extra efforts/expenses by not buying another equipment which, by not been from Respironics, may require different settings/procedures/loss of time and/or data.

Actions to Promote Competition: See  above

5 Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price: The anticipated price to the Government is $ 36,075.00. Prices are contract prices
6 Market Survey (FAR 10):
During the time period in which the VACHS Pulmonary/CCM section has led the efforts of its Sleep Laboratory, we have been very well satisfied with the service response whenever needed by Respironics. Due to the island of Puerto Rico geographical location, we have noted that some vendors lack the resources for serving within an effective time period our island. This was a problem years ago when our diagnostic equipment was of the Compumedics namebrand. Since such problems happened frequently, we had to occasionally halt the performance of procedures in this highly demanded Sleep Lab, many times requiring extra Fee basis expenses. Respironics has always offered excellent quality of prompt service, always available to satisfy our needs.

<DESC><p>***FOR A BETTER FORMAT VIEW, PLEASE SEE ATTACHMENT ENTITLED 2011 BAA ANNOUNCEMENT AFCEEBAA-11-001***</p>
<p>Broad Agency Announcement for Innovative Technologies and Methodologies for Reducing Various Environmental Problems<br />General Information<br /><br />Document Type: Re-posting for FY11<br />Solicitation Number: AFCEEBAA-11-001<br />Reference: AFCEEBAA-08-001 original March 27, 2008<br />Posted Date: 02 Nov 10</p>
<p>Notes:<br />This is FY11 BAA announcement based off the previous announcement FY08 AFCEEBAA-08-001 dated March 27, 2008. FY10 BAA (Phase I and II) proposals are expired with the new FY11 BAA announcement. If you would like to be reconsidered under this announcement you will need to re-submit as stated below.</p>
<p>Synopsis/Announcement:<br />This solicitation constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE), Technical Division (TD), Technology Transfer Program under FAR 6.102(d)(2). This announcement seeks out proposals that demonstrate and validate innovative, sustainable, and cost-effective technologies and/or methodologies that will lead to accelerated closure of environmental sites across the Air Force, eliminate or reduce hazardous material use and environmental release, and serve the Air Force's future environmental needs. Validated technologies and methodologies must comply with all applicable regulatory requirements, policies and guidance in the Restoration, Compliance, Pollution Prevention, and Military Munitions Response Programs. This acquisition is not to test theoretical concepts or technologies and methodologies that currently exist solely in a laboratory research and development (R&amp;D) phase or that have already been tested and validated multiple times in the field. The areas of need include:</p>
<p>1. Characterization - Proposals should focus on improved methods for effective detection, quantification, monitoring, fate and transport modeling of NAPLs and innovative methodologies for sampling, data validation, and human health and ecological risk assessments for explosive residuals at Air Force installations.</p>
<p>2. Emerging Contaminants - Proposals should include sampling and analytical methodologies or innovative treatment technologies for contaminants currently on USEPA's Candidate Contaminant List that have potential Air Force implications pending future regulations.</p>
<p>3. Long-Term Monitoring (LTM) - Proposals should describe technologies and/or methodologies that reduce the labor requirements, sampling and analyses of waste generated, energy requirements, or other costs associated with LTM programs. Such technologies could include new sensors, analytical methodologies, or statistical methods.</p>
<p>4. Pollution Prevention - Proposals should identify opportunities to eliminate or reduce the release of hazardous chemicals or minimize the regulatory burden and cost associated with the use and life-cycle management of hazardous materials. Proposals should include some quantifiable measure for either reduced chemical use or release, achievement of Executive Order 13514 goals, and total process operational cost. Proposals involving Air Force Weapon Systems may be considered if compatible with existing technical order and specification requirements for targeted systems/component.</p>
<p>5. Remediation - Proposals should demonstrate/validate innovative and/or sustainable technologies for enhanced recovery of mobile LNAPL, removal of recoverable DNAPL, in-situ treatment of residual LNAPL in vadose zone soils, in-situ treatment of residual DNAPL in unconsolidated soils or fractured bedrock environments, or improved treatment of explosives residuals in soil, runoff, and groundwater.</p>
<p>Proposal submittal is a two-phase process. Phase I requires completion of a 2 page proposal summary form (white paper), which is found along with instructions attached to this solicitation and can also be obtained at http://www.afcee.brooks.af.mil/pkv/baa. Additionally the U.S. Air Force "BAA Guide For Industry March 2008" is attached and on the BAA website. Each electronic form shall address only one area of need and shall be in accordance with this announcement. PHASE I SUBMITTALS ARE DUE NO LATER THAN 4:00 PM CST, 16 DECEMBER 2010. Phase I submittals received after 16 December 2010 per FAR52.215-1(c)(3). Phase I proposals are evaluated by the Air Force's Technical Evaluation Board (TEB) using the selection criteria included with the proposal instructions. It is critical that proposals convey the requested information accurately and concisely to facilitate their review. Offerors whose proposals are judged innovative and that meet Air Force needs are notified electronically via email to submit a Phase II proposal; those not selected are notified accordingly. Offerors invited to submit a Phase II proposal are provided a link in the electronic notification by which the Phase II proposals are to be submitted. Note: To be eligible for an award, submission of Phase I is required. <br /><br />Contracting Office Address:<br />Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment, HQ AFCEE/ACR<br />2261 Hughes Avenue, Suite 155, Lackland AFB, TX, 78236-9853, UNITED STATES</p>

<p><br />CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT</p>
<p><br />52.204-7 CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (APR 2008)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause--</p>
<p>Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database means the primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.</p>
<p>Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>Registered in the CCR database means that--</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and</p>
<p>(2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record ``Active''. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the CCR registration process.</p>
<p>(b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.</p>
<p>(2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation "DUNS" or "DUNS +4" followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database.</p>
<p>(c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.</p>
<p>(1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number--</p>
<p>(i) Via the Internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the offeror does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The offeror should indicate that it is an offeror for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>
<p>(2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information:</p>
<p>(i) Company legal business.</p>
<p>(ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized.</p>
<p>(iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and Zip Code.</p>
<p>(iv) Company Mailing Address, City, State and Zip Code (if separate from physical).</p>
<p>(v) Company Telephone Number.</p>
<p>(vi) Date the company was started.</p>
<p>(vii) Number of employees at your location.</p>
<p>(viii) Chief executive officer/key manager.</p>
<p>(ix) Line of business (industry).</p>
<p>(x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity).</p>
<p>(d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror.</p>
<p>(e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation.</p>
<p>(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(g)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p><br />CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT</p>
<p><br />52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JUN 2008)</p>
<p>(a) North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and small business size standard. The NAICS code and small business size standard for this acquisition appear in Block 10 of the solicitation cover sheet (SF 1449). However, the small business size standard for a concern which submits an offer in its own name, but which proposes to furnish an item which it did not itself manufacture, is 500 employees.</p>
<p>(b) Submission of offers. Submit signed and dated offers to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this solicitation. Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show--</p>
<p>(1) The solicitation number;</p>
<p>(2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers;</p>
<p>(3) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror;</p>
<p>(4) A technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation. This may include product literature, or other documents, if necessary;</p>
<p>(5) Terms of any express warranty;</p>
<p>(6) Price and any discount terms;</p>
<p>(7) "Remit to" address, if different than mailing address;</p>
<p>(8) A completed copy of the representations and certifications at FAR 52.212-3 (see FAR 52.212-3(b) for those representations and certifications that the offeror shall complete electronically);</p>
<p>(9) Acknowledgment of Solicitation Amendments;</p>
<p>(10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information); and</p>
<p>(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.</p>
<p>(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.</p>
<p>(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender's request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.</p>
<p>(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers:</p>
<p>(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.</p>
<p>(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--</p>
<p>(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.</p>
<p>(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.</p>
<p>(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.</p>
<p>(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.</p>
<p>(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.</p>
<p>(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the offer.</p>
<p>(i) Availability of requirements documents cited in the solicitation. (1)(i) The GSA Index of Federal Specifications, Standards and Commercial Item Descriptions, FPMR Part 101-29, and copies of specifications, standards, and commercial item descriptions cited in this solicitation may be obtained for a fee by submitting a request to--GSA Federal Supply Service Specifications Section, Suite 8100, 470 East L'Enfant Plaza, SW, Washington, DC <br />20407, Telephone (202) 619-8925, Facsimile (202) 619-8978.</p>

<p>(j) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number. (Applies to all offers exceeding $3,000, and offers of $3,000 or less if the solicitation requires the Contractor to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation "DUNS" or "DUNS +4" followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address. The DUNS +4 is the DUNS number plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned at the discretion of the offeror to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR Subpart 32.11) for the same concern. If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. An offeror within the United States may contact Dun and Bradstreet by calling 1-866-705-5711 or via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform.

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.</p>
<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum:</p>

<p>Justification: The current support agreement is approaching expiration. The current Netbackup software and support in place is required. Introduction of another manufacturer's software will create a compatibility problem and the required software support is currently only available from the manufacturer and approved resellers. Procurement of alternative backup software and support thereof would require procurement of new client software for every server serviced by the master server and is not cost effective. Further, extensive conversion of all existing backup data to the new software would be required.</p>
<p>Potential offerors shall be Symantec resell partners and shall include documentation verifying their reseller authority to be considered technically acceptable.</p>
<p>The evaluation factor(s) for award is; lowest-price, technically acceptable. Any resulting contract or order will be firm-fixed price. The Government intends to evaluate quotations and make award without conducting discussions.</p>
<p>Please place "SP4707-11-Q-0003" in the subject field of any e-mail correspondence. Questions regarding this RFQ are due by 11/5/2010 at 4:30 p.m. EST. Responses are due by 11/9/2010 4:30 p.m. EST.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>The solicitation number for this notice is SP3300-11-Q-0007. This is an unrestricted acquisition for vendors that can provide the required annual maintenance for EMC Storage Area Network servers. The NAICS code is 541519. The size standard is 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>This notice incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-46 effective 29 September 2010 and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) DCN 20101025 edition and Defense Logistics Acquisition Directive (DLAD) Current to Revision 5 and PROCLTR 2010-39. The complete text of any of the clauses and provisions may be accessed in full text at http://farsite.hill.af.mil.</p>
<p>This procurement is for the purchase of EMC SAN hardware/software maintenance for DLA Distribution Information Operations New Cumberland, PA.</p>
<p>See attached Statement of Work (Attachment 1). The SOW includes a required Bill of Materials.</p>
<p>This is a brand name requirement. Justification to restrict sources is as follows:<br />EMC is the sole manufacturer of the SAN servers which are proprietary in nature. EMC maintains exclusive rights to all products and services. Therefore, maintenance of the brand name servers must be performed by either EMC or an authorized support partner. It is essential that the EMC products utilized to provide for proper maintenance of the systems.</p>
<p>Offerors shall provide the unit price for each component and the total amount, inclusive of shipping costs (FOB Destination). All SAN servers are located at Information Operations at Susquehanna, PA.</p>
<p>Note: The required period of performance for the maintenance is the date of award through October 10, 2011. Prices submitted shall include a reinstatement fee to bring the maintenance current from October 11, 2010 through the date of the award. Estimated date of award is December 1, 2010.</p>
<p>Any award resulting from this solicitation will be issued on a Standard Form (SF) 1449.</p>
<p>The method of payment for supplies under this order is by the Acquisition Operations Office via the Government Purchase Card (VISA).</p>
<p>The following FAR, DFARS, and DLAD clauses and provisions apply to this acquisition. The full text version of these clauses and provisions may be viewed at http://farsite.hill.af.mil/.</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offers-Commercial Items. Addenda to 52.212-1; the following paragraphs are hereby deleted from this provision: (e) multiple offers and (h) multiple awards.</p>
<p>NOTE: To receive an award resulting from this solicitation, offerors MUST be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database IAW FAR 52.212-1(k) and DFARS 204.1104. Registration may be done on line at: www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>DLAD 52.233-9000 AGENCY PROTESTS (SEP 1999)</p>
<p>Companies protesting this procurement may file a protest 1) with the Contracting Officer, 2) with the General Accounting Office, or 3) pursuant to Executive Order No. 12979, with the Agency for a decision by the Activity's Chief of the Contracting Office. Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979." (Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the Contracting Officer; this is not an appellate review of a Contracting Officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the Contracting Officer). Absent a clear indication of the intent to file an agency level protest, protests will be presumed to be protests to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>(End of Provision)</p>
<p>DLAD 52.233-9001 DISPUTES: AGREEMENT TO USE ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (ADR) (JUN 2001)</p>

If unassisted negotiations are unsuccessful, the parties will use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques to try to resolve the dispute. Litigation will only be considered as a last resort when ADR is unsuccessful or has been documented by the party rejecting ADR to be inappropriate for resolving the dispute.</p>
<p>(b) Before either party determines ADR inappropriate, that party must discuss the use of ADR with the other party. The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.233-1, or for the agency, by the Contracting Officer, and approved at a level above the Contracting Officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal counsel (see DLA Directive 5145.1). Contractor personnel are also encouraged to include the ADR Specialist in their discussions with the Contracting Officer before determining ADR to be inappropriate.</p>

<DESC>GSA MULTIPLE AWARD SCHEDULE SOLICITATION FOR TEMPORARY ADMINISTRATIVE AND PROFESSIONAL STAFFING SERVICES (TAPS): The General Products Acquisition Center, Fort Worth, TX, is issuing a refreshed solicitation effective 7/1/09 electronically only. Interested parties may access the solicitation at http://www.fedbizopps.gov. Search using Solicitation Number 7FCM-N6-03-0736-B (include the dashes). Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 4.12 requires prospective contractors to complete electronic annual representations and certifications at http://orca.bpn.gov, in conjunction with required registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.  Prospective contractors are not eligible for an award, if their ORCA information is not current. Additionally, prospective contractors shall update the representations and certifications submitted to the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) as necessary, but at least annually, to ensure they are kept current, accurate, and complete.  This is a standing solicitation with no closing date for receipt of offers. The main changes to the solicitation are the implementation of the Goldstar Initiative. The Goldstar Initiative created the disclosure of current contract clauses in GSA eLibrary under each individual Schedule solicitation. FSS Contractors that have agreed to standard contract clauses without taking exception will receive a 'Goldstar' next to their name in GSA eLibrary. This solicitation will remain in effect until it is replaced by a refreshed solicitation. The Federal Supply Schedule period is continuous, and will contain contracts with periods that commence on the date of award (DOA) and expire five years (exclusive of any options) from the DOA unless further extended pursuant to any option to extend the term of the contract, or cancelled sooner. This solicitation contains an option clause, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Evergreen), which allows the Government to extend the contract three additional five-year periods, not to exceed a total of twenty years. All contracts will be indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contracts with a $2500 guaranteed minimum for the contract period. All contracts to be awarded include Industrial Funding provisions. Per Refresh 14, any paper offer received after March 10, 2010 will be rejected as non-responsive. Paper copies of rejected offers will not be returned to the offeror. The section at the beginning of the Vendor Response Document providing instructions for submitting a paper offer should be disregarded; Schedule 736 is a mandatory eOffer schedule, effective with Refresh 14.

<DESC><strong>ART IN ARCHITECTURE PROJECT<br />GSA Synopsis for Artist Services at the San Ysidro Land Port of <br />Entry in San Diego, CA<br />Artist Services Solicitation Number:  GS-09P-11-KT-C-0008</strong>
<p>FBO Classification:  R499<br />NAICS:  711510</p>
<p>Description:</p>
<p>The General Services Administration (GSA) Art in Architecture Program commissions American artists (citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents or Permanent Workers of the United States) to create publicly scaled and permanently installed artworks for federal buildings nationwide.</p>
<p>GSA announces an opportunity for a federal art commission in conjunction with the modernization and expansion of the San Ysidro Land Port of Entry in San Diego, California.</p>
<p>GSA will modernize and expand the San Ysidro Land Port of Entry to better meet the needs of its tenants:  U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, U.S. Border Patrol, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  The project entails the phased reconfiguration and expansion of the existing facility to improve pedestrian and vehicular processing, increase operational efficiency, provide greater officer and public safety, decrease operational and maintenance costs, and improve the traveler's experience of crossing the border.  The full build-out consists of the demolition and construction of the new port, including primary and secondary inspection areas, administration building, pedestrian building, and other supporting structures.</p>
<p>The project will be implemented in three phases, as follows:  Phase 1 - Northbound Vehicle throughput and associated facilities; Phase 2 - Northbound Pedestrian Facilities and the Historic Customs House; Phase 3 - Southbound Interstate-5 realignment and associated inspection facilities.</p>
<p>GSA allocates one-half of one percent of the estimated construction costs of new or modernized federal buildings for art commissions.  The art budget for all phases of the Land Port of Entry project is currently estimated to be $2,100,000.  One or more artists will be awarded a fixed-price contract for a commission.</p>
<p>Artists who wish to be considered for this and all future GSA art commissions must submit application materials to GSA's National Artists Registry (Registry).  The Registry constitutes the qualified list of artists for this and all GSA commissions.  Instructions on how to join the Registry are available on the following Web site:</p>
<p>www.gsa.gov/artinarchitecture</p>
<p>All artists who wish to be considered as candidates for a commission at the SanYsidro Land Port of Entry in San Diego, California, must have their application materials submitted and received by GSA by 3:00 PM Eastern Time on December 17, 2010.  Artists' submissions received after the deadline will not be considered for this project, but will be eligible for consideration on future GSA commissions alongside the other artists on the Registry.  Artists already on the Registry need not resubmit, but may elect to update their information prior to the deadline.</p>
<p>GSA evaluates artists based on the following criteria: the media, materials, content, style, and scope of the artist's past work, along with the artist's past performance and experience with commissions or projects similar to the one described in this synopsis.  Short-listed artists will be contacted and asked to submit additional information including a statement that he or she can perform the work associated with the GSA commission within the identified budget.  GSA will count the combined weight of all the selection criteria as significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>At a minimum, the scope of services for this commission will require: collaboration with the lead designer selected for the building project; development of preliminary and final concepts; fabrication of the artwork; participation in meetings and conservation reviews as necessary; and the installation of the artwork at the project site.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 FAX: 202.475.3904 The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

Quoters are encouraged to use Standard Form 1449, Solicitation/Contract/ Order for Commercial Items form found at http://www.gsa.gov/forms/pdf_file and submit a proposal. All qualified responsible small business sources may submit a quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES. Quotations received without the completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 may be considered non-compliant. Beginning January 1, 2005, the FAR requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations.
 With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. ORCA also allows Government personnel to access your information online, thus eliminating the need for you to submit representations and certifications with each offer. To register in ORCA you will need an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company's ID and password into ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire.
 The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCA's homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov/help.aspx. Full text of FAR and DFARS provisions and clauses may be accessed at http://www.farsite.hill.af.mil/vffara.htm and http://farsite.hill.af.mil/VFDFARA.HTM, respectively.

Are you set on having a 48V array?  WE ARE SET ON USING 48V.
Are the solar modules required to be made in the USA? YES
Are we required to use a "brand new" cargo trailer or will a lightly used one suffice? NEW TRAILER IS REQUIRED--AS THE SOW IDENTIFIES
What type of fuel would you like the generator to operate on?  PROPANE
Has a feasibility study been performed as to other sources of alternative energy power such as Hydro, geothermal, wind, or fuel cell? YES, NO OTHER OPTIONS ARE FEASIBLE
Would you consider changing the solicitation to a RFP Design Build so that alternative methods can be addressed besides just using a trailer type system? NO 
With other methods, your cost could be significantly less, maintenance could be less of an issue, reliability could be better, and you would show a better green foot print because of not having to tow trailers around. TRAILER SYSTEM IS THE ONLY FEASIBLE OPTION

<p><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</strong> - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Transition Specialist position utilizes the experience and skills gained from working with political transition programs and operations in the field to provide support and guidance for program funded staff and to help ensure successful implementation of program funded transition activities in the field.</p>
<p>The majority of the workload of this position will be in direct support of political transition program implementation. In order to help ensure successful political transitions overseas in rapidly changing environments, the Transition Specialist will ensure that OTI staff, implementing partner staff, and other key players have the information and training they need to start up new programs, seek out and work with appropriate beneficiaries in the field, and manage and close out activities effectively and efficiently. The vast majority of the workload for this position will be in direct support of political transition program implementation</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this solicitation is to provide a full-time Transition Specialist to the Office of Transition Initiatives.</p>

When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its objectives and mandates OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts. These knowledgeable and skilled professionals are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives and must be prepared to work both in Washington and the field, often with little time for preparations.</p>
<p>The OTI Senior Transition Specialist position was developed to allow OTI to take advantage of the accumulated experience of field staff following closure of the country program(s) which they managed. As OTI is evolving to carry out more assessments, provide more experientially based technical advice and analysis, and facilitate earlier consideration of countries that face possible political crises, having access to individuals with hands-on experience in transition programming will enhance our ability to deepen understanding, identify opportunities and constraints, and be more prepared to execute programming when necessary.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>To hire qualified personnel to provide expertise in transition programming.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The Senior Transition Specialist is assigned a range of special projects and provides advice, analysis, guidance and training as a subject matter expert on all aspects of political transition programming for OTI Staff, Implementing Partners, and other key partners and contacts both within and outside of USAID. The Senior Transition Specialist will also be involved in strategic design of various OTI country programs and the development of management products for OTI based on lessons learned.</p>
<p>Duties and Responsibilities</p>
<p>The Senior Transition Specialist priorities are expected to change and evolve in accordance with the requirements of OTI and will be determined in consultation with and under the direct supervision of the Washington-based Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Chief of Field Programs Division or his or her designee. Under the supervision of the DCHA/OTI Chief of Field Programs Division (FPD), the Washington-based Senior Transition Specialist will perform the following duties:</p>
<p>&bull; Fill critical program implementation staffing needs in Washington, D.C. and the field including the provision of ad hoc support to new OTI country program start-ups and on-call technical assistance, including providing supervisory support;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist with the development of information management products and improved business practices for OTI based on research and personal field experience lessons learned;</p>
<p>&bull; Provide training and mentoring on OTI program implementation for OTI staff both in Washington and the field as required;</p>
<p>&bull; Conduct, in collaboration with the relevant OTI regional team, assessments for possible new country programs, and visits to field sites in areas where OTI has projects;</p>
<p>&bull; Execute, if required, closeout activities related to OTI programs, and provide technical assistance to ongoing evaluations of OTI programs in the field;</p>
<p>&bull; When required, negotiate, within the guidelines provided by the OTI Chief, FPD, or his/her designee, program and project agreements with governmental and non-governmental counterparts;</p>
<p>&bull; Analyze and report on current political developments and security concerns as well as other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull; Conceptualize and design country program strategies and objectives in close coordination with OTI staff, USAID and U.S. Department of State personnel, and other governmental and non-governmental actors, based on political analysis and U.S. Government policy. When necessary, assist in refining strategic objectives and advocate on behalf of new programmatic approaches in-country, possibly linked to neighboring country programs if considered appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull; Represent and articulate OTI's mission and global programs to visitors, senior officials from international organizations, bilateral donors and national and local foreign government officials;</p>
<p>&bull; Identify or seek out NGOs, international donors, U.S. Government (USG) agencies and other organizations of importance to OTI programs in Washington and the field, and develop and maintain professional relationships with them;</p>
<p>&bull; Advise and/or assist in drafting documents outlining future planning and vision in the development and implementation of OTI programs, and assist in developing and improving country program monitoring and evaluation systems, providing guidance on designing and managing final evaluations;</p>
<p>&bull; Advise Senior Management and Team Leaders on budget processes and reviews, preparing justification documentation when necessary;</p>
<p>&bull; Update and revise, as needed, program management guides, including strategic planning and field operations materials;</p>
<p>&bull; Serve as a liaison with other DCHA offices, other USAID divisions and the State Department on program and policy direction;</p>
<p>&bull; Help ensure that OTI's programs and their activities are monitored and evaluated and that lessons learned from the activities feed into ongoing or future activities;</p>
<p>&bull; Ensure appropriate resource allocation among OTI field offices and implementing partners;</p>
<p>&bull; Provide other services as required to fulfill OTI's program objectives.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Senior Transition Specialist will take direction from and will report to OTI's Chief of Field Programs Division or his/her designee.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The Supervisor will set overall objectives. The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision.</p>

Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>If you are interested in this project, please provide the information requested above to the AETC/LGCT Contracting Office.</p>
<p><strong>Hanscom AFB, MA Electrical Distribution System:</strong> Hanscom AFB electrical service is provided at 14.4-kilovolts (kV) through three sets of 500-thousand-circular-mill (kcmil or MCM) EPR cables to the Base substation. At the Base perimeter, near the Small Business Office (Building 1100) and the former Phillips Laboratory Gate (Gate 3), a manhole is located where responsibility for the electrical system shifts from NSTAR, the transmission and distribution (T&amp;D) provider, and Transcanada, the commodity provider, to Hanscom AFB.</p>
<p>From the manhole at the Base perimeter, the circuits are routed through an underground duct bank to the Base&rsquo;s main substation. This substation serves as the main power distributor for the entire Base. That portion of the substation where the main incoming and feeder breakers are housed is made up of a section of walk in metal enclosed switchgear. This is where the Electric Utility owned revenue meters are located. The switchgear main bus is rated for 2,000 A at 15 kV. The main incoming NSTAR lines and bus tie circuit breakers are rated 2,000 amperes (A) and the feeder breakers are rated 1,200 A, all at 15 kV. The switchgear is arranged in a four bus configuration with an incoming feed serving each of three of the four buses with tie breakers between adjacent buses. Each of the four buses has three feeder breakers for serving load. Spaces for three spare breakers are available on Bus No. 2 and 3 to allow for future expansion. From the main bus, three breakers feed the three 3,750-kV amperes (kVA), 14.4- to 4160/2520-V power transformers located in the substation. One of the transformers feeds the former Phillips Laboratory and part of the former Rome Laboratory area. A second (newest) transformer serves the on-Base steam and chilled water plant. The third transformer is used as a spare transformer and may be used to backup either of the two utilized transformers. Switching arrangements are available to shift loads and services among all three transformers. From the main bus, five distribution circuits feed the remainder of the Base.</p>
<p>All primary feed is contained within concrete encased conduit, 75% of which under pavement.</p>
<p>The Hanscom AFB electric distribution system is currently monitored by fault indicator equipment at 73 total locations throughout the main base. Fault indicator equipment is connected to the EMCS system on the electric distribution wiring. The SCADA system reads the substation. Equipment is monitored at the computer in the Exterior Electric Shop, Building 1817. A SCADA system reads the substation.</p>
<p>NSTAR is the transportation and distribution provider and Transcanada is the commodity provider that supplies power to the Fourth Cliff Family Recreational Area through a single service at the main entrance.</p>
<p>National Grid supplies power to the Sagamore Hill Air Weather Services Facility through a tap from the 4.16-kilovolt (kV) distribution feeder on Sagamore Street. Located at the feeder tap are the metering facilities and riser pole transition down to the government-owned underground circuit that feeds up the hill and into the station. Government ownership of the electric facilities starts at the load side of the air break switch located at the metering facilities along Sagamore Street.</p>
<p>The Town of Hudson&rsquo;s Office of the Light and Power Department supplies power to the Sudbury Geophysics Research Annex through one overhead service to the facility. Government ownership of the electric facilities starts at the load side of the primary metering pole along Hudson Road.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Hanscom AFB, MA Water Distribution System:<br /></strong></span>The Hanscom AFB water distribution system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the distribution system from the point in which the distribution system enters the Installation and Government ownership currently starts to the point of demarcation, defined by the Right of Access. The utility system is composed of, without limitation, valves, fire hydrants, water distribution mains, meters, and storage tanks. The actual inventory of items sold will be in the bill of sale at the time the system is transferred. The following description and inventory is included to provide the Contractor with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the distribution system. The Government makes no representation that the inventory is accurate. The Contractor shall base its proposal on site inspections, information in the technical library, other pertinent information, and to a lesser degree the following description and inventory. <br />Specifically excluded from the water distribution system privatization are:<br />&bull; Approximately 6,800 linear feet of cast iron piping owned by the U.S. Navy.<br />&bull; Hanscom AFB Military Family Housing water distribution<br />&bull; Mobile Home Park remaining water distribution system<br />&bull; Ipswich Antenna Test Facility<br />The Town of Lexington provides 95 percent of the potable water supply to Hanscom AFB through three metered connections:<br />&bull; Hartwell Avenue connection - located where the Hanscom AFB 8-inch main connects to the Town of Lexington main at the Town of Lexington-owned meter on Hartwell Avenue. <br />&bull; Wright Street connection - located where the Hanscom AFB 10-inch main, located within a 50-foot wide easement through an off-Base housing development, connects to the Town of Lexington-owned meter near Katahdin Hill on Wright Street. <br />&bull; Wood Street Emergency connection - this connection is made through a normally closed 8-inch main on Wood Street which connects to the Town of Lexington owned meter connection, which is approximately 100 feet southeast of its intersection with Hartwell Avenue. <br />The remaining 5 percent of potable water supplied to the Base serves the trailer park and Family Camp area located north of Massport's L.G. Hanscom Airport. The trailer park is served by the Town of Bedford through a meter owned by the Air Force; the Family Camp area is served by the Town of Lexington through an Air Force-owned meter. <br />Hanscom AFB, as well as both towns, receive their water from the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA). The Town of Lexington and the Town of Bedford provide water at separate locations on the installation which are not connected and are separately metered. Hanscom AFB holds a 1996 Certificate of Registration (PWS ID# 3023002) from the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) Division of Water Supply as a registered public water supplier in Massachusetts. The Towns of Lexington and Bedford, which supply the water, provide water quality monitoring. MWRA provides disinfection. The Base has discontinued the use of its hypochlorite injection disinfection systems this is because of the stability of the disinfection approach where the water system generally contains approximately 2 milligrams per liter (mg/L) of available chlorine. Hanscom AFB currently provides no additional disinfection for the water system.<br />The water supply pressure from the City is too high for standard municipal service and, therefore, is reduced for use on the Base at two pressure reducing valve stations which then provide adequate water pressure on Base. As noted above, the Base can supplement the disinfection provided by the Town of Lexington to the main Base, if necessary, with three onsite chlorination systems, but discontinued their use in January 2001.<br />The average depth of the buried pipe at Hanscom AFB is approximately six to eight feet.<br />The military family housing areas are not a part of the system to be privatized. Military family housing connects to the Hanscom AFB installation main at six locations: <br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Military Family Housing POD #1</span> is at the downstream connection to main water valve (MWV) 46A. This is the connection of the Military Family Housing 8" main with the Hanscom AFB main. This is located at the center of Vandenburg drive, near BLDG 1630.<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Military Family Housing POD #2</span> is at the downstream connection to MWV 146, this is the connection of the 10" Hanscom AFB main from Marrett Road with the Military Family Housing main on Offutt Road. This is located where the system intersects with the Leased Area boundary.<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Military Family Housing POD #3</span> is at the downstream connection of MWV 93E, where the service lateral for Building 2001 leaves the Hanscom AFB main. This is located on Ent Road approximately 150 linear feet northeast of the intersection of Ent Road with Patterson Road.<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Military Family Housing POD #4</span> is at MWV 93B, located at the south east corner of the intersection of Patterson Road and Ent Road. Ownership does not include the valve.<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Military Family Housing POD #5</span> is at MWV 93A, located on Ent Road near the intersection with Patterson Road. Ownership does not include the valve.<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Military Family Housing POD#6</span> is at valve 1145, located near the intersection of Adams Road and Colonial Place. This POD is located to the south of Building 1994. Ownership includes the valve.<br />The City of Marshfield, through a cooperative agreement with the Town of Scituate, supplies potable water to the Fourth Cliff Family Recreation Area from a Town of Scituate main located near the facility gate. A Town of Scituate water meter, located near the connection, meters water consumption. The potable water distribution system serves cabins and other structures, and recreational vehicle (RV) hookups. <br />The Town of Hamilton supplies potable water to the Sagamore Hill Air Weather Services Facility from a Town main located near the gate. A Town water meter located at the main building meters water consumption. Water consumption is estimated to be less than 250 gallons per day (gpd).</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Hanscom AFB, MA Wastewater Distribution System:</strong></span></p>
<p>
<p>The Hanscom AFB wastewater system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the collection system from the point of demarcation defined by the Right of Access. The system may include, but is not limited to, infrastructure identified in Table 1. The actual inventory of items sold will be in the bill of sale at the time the system is transferred. The following description and inventory is included to provide the UP Contractor with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the system. The Government makes no representation that the inventory is accurate. The UP Contractor shall base its proposal on site inspections, information in the technical library, other pertinent information, and to a lesser degree the following description and inventory. <br />Specifically excluded from the wastewater system privatization are:<br />&bull; oil water separators<br />&bull; grease traps<br />&bull; storm sewers<br />&bull; groundwater treatment system<br />&bull; former trailer park site<br />Wastewater generated by Hanscom AFB discharges into Town of Bedford by sanitary sewer main(s) via four (4) Town of Bedford owned manholes along the east side of the Base, after which it travels south to Town of Bedford's wastewater treatment plant. The Wastewater collection system is operated and maintained by Hanscom AFB. <br />The sanitary wastewater system at Hanscom AFB includes collection mains, two main pump stations, and one small pump station, each of which is described below. Wastewater is discharged to the Town of Bedford's sewer system. The Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) provides treatment for wastewater in the region. <br />The collection piping consists of vitrified clay, ductile iron, and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) piping. There are no wastewater treatment facilities on Base. The average depth of buried piping is approximately eight feet.<br />The Upper Main pump station (Building 1306) sewage pumping controls were upgraded in 1999. The pump station includes three pumps located in a below grade concrete dry well. The pumps draw from two wet wells that have a combined capacity of 250,000 gallons. The station is designed for two pumps, with one on stand-by. The Upper Main pump station pumps the Base's total sewage flow to the Town of Bedford's sewer force main through a new ductile iron pipe force main constructed in 1996 along Hartwell Avenue. The point of connection is at Route 2 with Bedford's force main; from there the flow continues on to the regional treatment facility owned by MWRA. There also is a Town of Bedford metered connection at the intersection of Wood Street and Hartwell Ave., which is used for emergency overflow only. <br />The Lower Main pump station (Building 1539) was rebuilt in 1987 and pumps upgraded in 1994.

<DESC><p>AETC CONS/LGCT seeks to update this presolicitation notice dated 9 Aug 2009 due to delays in issuing the RFP. You are hereby given an additional 30 days to respond with sources sought information as indicated below if you would like to placed on the RFP source list.<br /><br />AETC CONS/LGCT seeks to identify, and obtain information from, responsible sources in connection with the privatization of the wastewater treatment system (NAICS 221320) at Hanscom AFB, MA. Privatization is defined as the conveyance of a utility system to a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or other entity. The conveyance may consist of all right, title, and interest of the United States in the utility system. Utility Privatization (UP) will be accomplished in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2688 Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority.
<p>Contractor will be required to assume ownership of the wastewater treatment system at Hanscom AFB, MA and as the new owner, shall operate and maintain the system and provide utility services to the Government. Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, management, supervision, permits, equipment, supplies, materials, transportation, and any other incidental items or services required for the complete ownership of and provision of utility services via these utility systems, including operation, maintenance, repair, upgrades, and improvements to the utility systems.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought Notice (hereinafter "Notice") is an essential step in determining market interest and feasibility. Responses received will be used to develop marketing strategies for the potential privatization of utilities at this installation. Should interest be determined sufficient, a formal solicitation may be forthcoming. Interested parties should provide a statement of interest on company letterhead by no later than 4:00 pm CST on September 9, 2009. Responses are preferred via e-mail, but hard copies and facsimiles will also be accepted.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">At a minimum, the statement of interest shall address:</span></strong> (1) capability and experience in utility privatization or owning and operating utility systems; (2) financial capability to justify potential award of such a contract; (3) a primary point of contact, including phone number and e-mail address; (4) an indication of the size of the business (large, small, or any sub-category of small business), and (5) for large businesses only an opinion on subcontracting possibilities with small and/or small, disadvantaged businesses. The potential opportunity for set-asides for small businesses and small disadvantaged businesses will be considered on the basis of the responses received.</p>
<p>This Notice is solely for the Government's use as a market research tool. As such, the issuance of a competitive solicitation is not guaranteed. If determined appropriate, then both a synopsis and a solicitation may be anticipated in the February-March 2010 timeframe. All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a response to this Notice. All information received will be considered. Failure to respond to this Notice does not preclude a firm from offering on any resultant solicitation; however, a lack of interest in this requirement may keep this effort from moving forward competitively.</p>
<p>This announcement shall not be construed as a commitment or authorization to incur costs in anticipation of an award. The Government is not bound to make any awards under this Notice.</p>
<p>If you are interested in this project, please provide the information requested above to the AETC/LGCT Contracting Office.</p>

<p>
<p>The Hanscom AFB wastewater system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the collection system from the point of demarcation defined by the Right of Access. The system may include, but is not limited to, infrastructure identified in Table 1. The actual inventory of items sold will be in the bill of sale at the time the system is transferred. The following description and inventory is included to provide the UP Contractor with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the system. The Government makes no representation that the inventory is accurate. The UP Contractor shall base its proposal on site inspections, information in the technical library, other pertinent information, and to a lesser degree the following description and inventory. <br />Specifically excluded from the wastewater system privatization are:<br />&bull; oil water separators<br />&bull; grease traps<br />&bull; storm sewers<br />&bull; groundwater treatment system<br />&bull; former trailer park site<br />Wastewater generated by Hanscom AFB discharges into Town of Bedford by sanitary sewer main(s) via four (4) Town of Bedford owned manholes along the east side of the Base, after which it travels south to Town of Bedford's wastewater treatment plant. The Wastewater collection system is operated and maintained by Hanscom AFB. <br />The sanitary wastewater system at Hanscom AFB includes collection mains, two main pump stations, and one small pump station, each of which is described below. Wastewater is discharged to the Town of Bedford's sewer system. The Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) provides treatment for wastewater in the region. <br />The collection piping consists of vitrified clay, ductile iron, and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) piping. There are no wastewater treatment facilities on Base. The average depth of buried piping is approximately eight feet.<br />The Upper Main pump station (Building 1306) sewage pumping controls were upgraded in 1999. The pump station includes three pumps located in a below grade concrete dry well. The pumps draw from two wet wells that have a combined capacity of 250,000 gallons. The station is designed for two pumps, with one on stand-by. The Upper Main pump station pumps the Base's total sewage flow to the Town of Bedford's sewer force main through a new ductile iron pipe force main constructed in 1996 along Hartwell Avenue. The point of connection is at Route 2 with Bedford's force main; from there the flow continues on to the regional treatment facility owned by MWRA. There also is a Town of Bedford metered connection at the intersection of Wood Street and Hartwell Ave., which is used for emergency overflow only. <br />The Lower Main pump station (Building 1539) was rebuilt in 1987 and pumps upgraded in 1994.

<DESC>The Forest Service contemplates releasing a solicitation on or about Oct. 28, 2010, for the Spit Point Stewardship project. This acquisition is under the authority of Section 347 of Public Law 105-277 to achieve land management objectives while meeting local community needs. In this acquisition, a combination of appropriated dollars and forest products will be used to obtain land management activities from a contractor. About 520 MBF of merchantable timber (a combination of spruce, hemlock, and alder) is available in three stands near Spit Point, in Carroll Inlet on Revillagigedo Island, near Ketchikan, Alaska. These stands are in the beach buffer, where previous clearcuts have resulted in dense conifer regeneration, elimination of the forage understory, and reduction in structural diversity. Two of the stands are 17 acres in size; one is 12 acres. In these three stands, the contractor will improve the wildlife habitat by removing biomass material and treating remaining slash. There are no roads connecting the project area to Ketchikan, and there are no roads connecting Ketchikan (or Revillagigedo Island) to the North American continent.
<p>The contemplated schedule includes solicitation release on or about Oct. 28, 2010, a pre-proposal conference in Ketchikan is scheduled to be&nbsp;on&nbsp;Nov. 22, 2010, and proposals due on Dec. 6, 2010. The solicitation&nbsp;is now&nbsp;available from this FedBizOpps website. A prospective offeror should visit this FedBizOpps website from time to time to stay up-to-date on this acquisition. A request for proposals (RFP) is contemplated. NAICS Code 113110, Classification Code F, and Product/Service Code F006 are contemplated.&nbsp;The anticipated award date is before Dec. 31, 2010.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered.</p>

<DESC>Request for Information
<p>Project: Next Generation Wireless Broadband Demonstrator</p>
<p>I. Description:</p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for informational and planning purposes and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, Request for Proposal, or Request for Quotes. In accordance with FAR 15.202(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Those who respond to this RFI should not anticipate feedback concerning its submission. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. The Government is not seeking proposals at this time. Additionally, the Government will not provide reimbursement for any information that may be submitted in response to this RFI. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. Note that responses should not take the form of a proposal and will not be understood as such. The information provided in this RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. All submissions become the property of the Federal Government and will not be returned.</p>
<p>II. Purpose:</p>
<p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) within the US Department of Homeland Security is responsible for securing the nation's borders against illegal entry of people and goods while managing legitimate travel and trade. To support this mission, CBP owns, operates, and maintains one of the largest tactical voice communications infrastructures in the Federal government. TACCOM systems are the primary communications lifeline for agents and officers and are critical to their safety, as well as the success of their missions and operations. To continue effectively supporting this mission, the current tactical communications system must be upgraded in a cost-effective and operationally efficient manner.</p>
<p>The Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Directorate is the primary research and development arm of the Department of Homeland Security. The S&amp;T Directorate's mission is to improve homeland security by providing to customers state-of-the-art technology that helps them achieve their missions. S&amp;T customers include the operating components of the Department, and state, local, tribal and territorial emergency responders and officials. S&amp;T is working with CBP to examine what technology is currently available in the marketplace and determine where research is needed to help ensure that they are able to continue operating effectively. This RFI is being released as part of this effort.</p>
<p>CBP must provide agent and officer connectivity and interoperability that allow all users and mission partners to share the information they need, when they need it, in a form they can understand and act on with confidence, and protects information from those who should not have it. This relies on the ability to provide secure voice, data and video communications and will focus on building a network that leverages commercial infrastructure wherever possible and supports current, emerging and future requirements.</p>
<p>As part of this effort, DHS is gathering information on technology that can address one or more of the following objectives:</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE #1: LMR over Broadband. Describe a portable, P25-compliant radio that is able to accept a standardized (e.g., USB or PCMCIA card) broadband wireless modem. Radio modes must permit the transmission of encrypted voice through direct, radio to radio talk around (i.e., no infrastructure), over existing Land Mobile Radio (LMR) network(s) (P25 /Legacy) VHF, UHF and/or 800MHZ trunking or over any broadband wireless network or technology (e.g., 3G/4G, LTE, CDMA, GSM) based on RF environment (e.g., network availability).</p>
<p>Responses to this objective must address the following questions:</p>
<p>1. What is the plan to avoid obsolesce and reconcile the difference between lifecycle and technical refresh rates? (Currently, LMR radios at 7-10 years and commercial broadband technologies at 2 years) How can the proposed technology be built to a common standard interface or upgraded/maintained to ensure that it is functional regardless of what telecommunications infrastructure it operates on.</p>
<p>2. What is the level of maturity of the proposed technology? Fielded? In development? If fielded, provide examples of current usage, including a description of the operational environment in which it is deployed (e.g., user organization, geographic location, number of users, etc.)</p>
<p>3. What is the plan for product evolution? Is this radio a prototype or an existing technology that will be modified as requirements emerge?</p>
<p>4. What is the rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost (per unit) for the proposed technology? If this solution has not yet been fielded, ensure that this ROM cost includes and developmental or test costs.</p>
<p>5. Describe operation of the unit; how does the radio select the operating mode (i.e., direct (talk- around), LMR network or broadband network)</p>
<p>6. Does the radio permit bridging technologies to extend the range of coverage (e.g., mesh scenario; take in-bound broadband voice and transmit via LMR direct)</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE #2: Remote Radio Management. Describe a solution that enables the remote configuration of radios and other devices, to include radio parameters (e.g., channel, RF configurations) and encryption keys using broadband and/or existing LMR networks. This solution should support the ability to manage and establish interoperable dynamic talk groups by centralized operations centers.</p>
<p>Responses to this objective must address the following questions:</p>
<p>1. How will this proposed solution perform over-the-air-rekeying and remote programming (over-the air programming) for LMR radios and commercial devices?</p>
<p>2. How will this proposed solution create and manage dynamic talk groups that connect CBP, federal, state, local and Tribal (FSLT) participants? Note: CBP and FSLT participants may be using different networks and devices.</p>
<p>3. What is the level of maturity of the proposed technology? Fielded, in development? If fielded, provide examples of current usage.</p>
<p>4. Described how your solution enables transmit/receive voice while performing over-the-air rekeying and/or over-the-air programming in parallel, without disruption.</p>
<p>5. Describe the scalability of this solution. Are there any limitations on the number of radios that can use this solution?</p>
<p>6. Describe the number of components required in your solution and the approximate cost.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE #3: Integrate multiple Broadband networks with existing private, commercial and government networks. Describe a solution that integrates multiple networks (e.g., AT&amp;T, Sprint, Verizon, commercial networks) and various technologies (e.g., CDMA, GSM, LTE) to provide seamless coverage with session persistence and adds conditioning to deliver a higher grade of service with regard to security, priority access, and network latency.</p>
<p>Responses to this objective must address the following questions:</p>
<p>1. What type of, if any, roaming agreements are necessary as part of the proposed solution?</p>
<p>2. Describe how coverage could be extended by adding new sites or integrating public/private networks.</p>
<p>3. What, if any, is the concept for priority access including ruthless preemption?</p>
<p>4. How will this solution meet required Law Enforcement Grade of Service (GoS). The GOS must include the following parameters:</p>
<p>a. Latency requirements (e.,g , &lt; 100msec)<br />b. Law enforcement grade PTT (e.g., &lt; 500msec connect times)<br />c. Priority based access <br />d. Security (Encryption- AES)<br />e. High availability- (&gt; 95%)</p>
<p>5. Has this type of solution been used anywhere previously?</p>
<p>6. How will charges be incurred as part of this solution (i.e., what is the cost model?) - minutes per device, number of devices, number of networks linked together, etc.?</p>
<p>III. How to Respond:</p>
<p>Information provided in response to this RFI must be submitted no later than 4:00 PM (Eastern Time) on November 30th, 2010, in the form of an electronic "white paper." Please note that the collection of this data does not obligate the U.S. Government to the incorporation of the provided information nor does it obligate the Government to the procurement of the services. Proprietary information and trade secrets, if any, must be clearly marked on all materials. All information received that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly. Responses to this RFI will not be returned. The white paper document shall be limited to 10 pages.</p>

<DESC>CORRECTED DESCRIPTION
Previous post said Tallahassee, Florida in the first paragraph. The correct location is in the Omaha, Nebraska area. The corrected description is below.

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Office of Construction and Facilities Management is looking for Architect/Engineer (AE) firms certified in the following categories: (1) Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), (2) Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB), (3) 8(a), (4) HubZone, (5) Woman Owned Small Business (WOSB), and/or (6) Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB.) for a new National Cemetery near Omaha, Nebraska. The AE firm must be approved under Landscape Architecture (NAICS 541320) or Civil Engineering (NAICS 541330) firm capable of preparing site acquisition and design documentation including, but not limited to: surveying, soils investigations, master plans, schematic design documents, and design development documents. Prime contractor should have licensed/registered landscape architects as members of the firm, or team, with experience in the planning and design of cemeteries, large institutional campuses, parks and recreational facilities, or similar land development projects.  The following additional licensed/registered specialty disciplines should be members of the firm, or team with demonstrable expertise in their respective fields: Water Management/Irrigation specialist, Cost Estimator, Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing Engineers, and Architect. The contract will include a government option for: design build RFP package or construction document preparation; construction period services, and site visits.

Probable Scope:

Assist DVA in site acquisition due diligence for an approximately 200-600 acre, new Omaha, Nebraska area National Cemetery site, including, but not limited to: surveying, soils investigations, site topography, etc. Following selection of a site, prepare a Master Plan for the entire site, and schematic design and design development documentation for the Phase 1 build-out, approximately 50 acres, of that site. Included, but not limited to as part of the design will be: main entrance area, assembly area, full casket gravesites containing pre-placed crypts, columbarium, cremains sites, roadways, irrigation, utilities, landscaping, signage, committal service shelters, combined public information center and administration building, maintenance building complex, parking, and public restrooms. Also included will be temporary structures necessary to operationally support an early construction turn over, of a limited number of gravesites. Incorporate Green Building Principles and Renewable Energy Initiatives. The completed Phase 1 of the project shall be LEED silver certified and meet all Federal Energy and Sustainability mandates. 

Once a thorough analysis of the user's and the cemetery's needs has been completed, the scope and method of meeting those needs may change and require a different approach.

This project will be accomplished utilizing the VA Program Guide (PG-18-15, Volume D), A/E Submission Instructions for National Cemetery Projects, as well as the National Cemetery Administration (NCA) Facilities Design Guide.  

In addition to design capabilities, estimating capabilities of the applicants will be considered. An estimate of construction cost based on level of design detail will be required at each design phase. The selected firm shall design to the government's estimated cost for construction.

<DESC>This RFI is amended to provide an answer to a question that was posed by an interested party.  

Question:  Is the VA looking for an in depth report that is more of a research project to be completed upon a time line or is this something that is more of a network tool that acts more like a thermometer? Are you looking for a tool that is just available in real time or something that would allow you to craft programs that mitigate the future needs of Veterans? 
Answer:  The homelessness initiative is looking for a software tool that is available that will be fed with numbers such as those parameters in the RFI (unemployment, etc) and what comes out of the tool is the impact of such to veterans homelessness and thus a relationship (to be part of the tool) about the degree of impact (increase/decrease) on homeless programs being managed by the VA.

<DESC>The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) has developed and demonstrated a Juvenile Salmon Acoustic Telemetry System (JSATS) consisting of acoustic micro-transmitters (tags) and autonomous, cabled, and portable/mobile acoustic receivers for evaluating behavior and survival of juvenile salmonids migrating through the Columbia River Federal Power System (FCRPS). Receivers have been deployed at large hydro-electric dams, free flowing sections of the FCRPS as well as the estuary of the Columbia River. Self-contained autonomous receivers that detect, decode, and store decoded messages are typically deployed in areas within the Columbia River basin where a power source is not readily available and cable runs not feasible for a variety of reasons. Cabled receivers detect, decode, and store decoded messages, time of arrival, and message waveforms as received on up to four hydrophones at large hydro-electric dams within the FCRPS. Receiver clocks are synchronized across all receivers with time obtained from GPS receivers. Cabled receivers are used for estimating route and time of passage including 2D and 3D position estimates for tagged fish. Portable receivers detect, decode, store, and display transmitted signals for in laboratory transmitter testing and for displaying and entering transmitter codes at the time of tagging. A mobile receiver consisting of a single-4 hydrophone cluster deployed from a single boat has been used to provide 2D and 3D position estimates on actively migrating tagged fish. In 2010, the USACE intends to award a multi-year (one year with four option years) firm-fixed price single award task order contract for the manufacturing and delivery of the above receiver types. In addition to manufacturing this contract will include line items for the repair or upgrade receivers as well as a line item for technical support. All functional specifications for the JSATS are government owned and will be provided in the solicitation package. Where applicable, the design specifications and drawings for existing JSATS receivers will be provided. Government furnished hydrophone assemblies designed specifically for JSATS receivers will be recommended for use in the cabled, mobile, and portable receivers.<BR><BR>This procurement action shall be conducted in two phases, an evaluation phase and a production phase. In order to be eligible for award, and as part of the evaluation criteria, the offeror must demonstrate that their JSATS receiver meets the functional and design specifications provided in the solicitation. The USACE will use lowest price, technically acceptable protocols for selection of up to two qualified firms. These firms will be awarded contracts to enter into the evaluation phase (Phase I) of this action. The evaluation phase shall consist of the preparation of two fully functional prototype autonomous receivers that will be evaluated for performance by a USACE contractor. Following acceptance testing of prototype receivers the USACE will use Tradeoff/Best Value protocols to select a single company to enter into the production phase (Phase II) of the contract. Evaluation and rating factors will be included in the solicitation when issued. The solicitation (RFQ) outlining receiver specifications will be posted on or around 15 June 2010.<BR><BR>The primary Contracting Point of Contact is Lea Zumwalt. She can be contacted at (503) 808-4608, or by e-mail lea.m.zumwalt@usace.army.mil. <BR><BR>

Justification and Approval
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	Contracting Organization: Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 4, Louis A. Johnson Medical Center (Station 540).

2.	Description of Action: This is a request for other than full and open competition for the procurement of a replacement digital detector for a Toshiba T.Rad diagnostic imaging machine from Torres & Associates (doing business as Sustainment Technologies) a SDVOSB.

3.	Description of Supplies or Services: One 14" X 17" digital detector, part number: CXDI-50G, used in the Diagnostic Service at the Louis A. Johnson VAMC.

4.	Statutory Authority:
	(  )	(1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	(X) (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
	(  )	(3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
		       or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
	(  )	(4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
	(X)	(5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
	(  )	(6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
	(  )	(7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

5.	Validity of Use of Statutory Authority:  This vendor has a current GSA contract for medical equipment maintenance and service; however this particular item is not covered under the schedule, it is an open market item.  Given the urgent nature of this procurement and its specialized application, the CO orally solicited quotes from three known vendors who carry this replacement part, but only received two responses.  Equally, this procurement is authorized by 38 U.S.C.  8127(b) and PL 109-461 Veterans Benefits, Healthcare, and Information Technology Act of 2006. The Imaging Department of Diagnostic Service provides around the clock vital clinical support functions to all patient care activities within the medical center. The goal of Diagnostic Service is to provide accurate and timely diagnostic information to medical center clinicians in direct support of patient care functions. As part of this direct-patient care provided to veterans, our staff utilizes the latest diagnostic imaging technology to perform X-ray studies. In order to fulfill this mission, imaging equipment must be ready to function as much as possible. Acquisition of this digital detector will return the radiography room to service in order to provide treatment to our patients, which is currently idle because of the lack of a properly functioning detector.

6.	Actions to Promote Competition: Given the urgency of this procurement, it is not known to this CO how to avoid future barriers to competition at this time.  It is not feasible to have an inventory of such expensive replacement parts, not knowing if such items will be needed in the future.  Furthermore, given the amount of technological advancements, it is possible that this item, if carried as inventory, could be outdated prior to being used.

7.	Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price:  The anticipated price to the Government is $ 84,030.67.  Of the two responses received, Torres & Associates quote seems fair and reasonable when compared to Toshiba American medical Systems' quote of $153,950.00 for the same item.   

8.	Market Survey (FAR 10): The urgency of this procurement precluded thorough market research.  It is in the best interest of patients at this facility and the government to get this machine restored to proper working condition.  It is also possible that synopsizing and posting this solicitation on FedBizOps wouldn't have resulted in better pricing than what has already been received. The original equipment manufacturer (OEM) Canon Corporation, no longer manufactures the requested item. Torres & Associates can provide a detector that is fully compatible with our equipment. 

9.	Other Considerations: The vendor chosen for this acquisition is a SDVOSB and is the current provider for the Biomedical Combined Maintenance Contract.  

10.	Listing of Sources that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition: Torres & Associates and Toshiba America Medical Systems.

11.	Statement of Actions to Overcome Barriers to Competition: Given the urgency of this procurement, it is not known to this CO how to avoid barriers to competition at this time.  It is not feasible to have an inventory of such expensive replacement parts.

12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a bonafide need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
