<CONTACT>Kevin Ceponis, Email kevin.ceponis@psc.hhs.gov
<DESC>Intent to Sole Source:
<p>Pursuant to the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), the Contracting Officer may solicit from one source if the Contracting Officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source is reasonably available. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Program Support Center (PSC), Acquisition Management Services (AMS) on behalf of PSC, Office of the Chief Information Officer (HHS/OS/OCIO) intends to sole source to:</p>
<p>Iron Bow Technologies, LLC<br />4800 Westfields Blvd, Ste 300<br />Chantilly, VA 20151-2299</p>
<p>This document outlines a comprehensive professional services catalog proposal for the HP Open View Service Center application. Service Center is the incidents and requests tracking ticketing system currently used by the Office of Enterprise Applications Development (OEAD)/CSD and their customers in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), located in Silver Spring, Maryland. The current support agreement with HP Open View is a licensing agreement that provides access to HP support for topics related to standard, out-of-the-box (OOB) objects and configuration records issues. In contrast, the professional services catalog offered by Iron Bow Technologies (IBT) allows OEAD to continuously maintain and enhance software features that are specifically tailored to support the HHS. The Service Center application was first deployed at HHS/OEAD in January 2003.</p>
<p>In late 2002, as part of an initiative to modernize the software supporting several of the helpdesks in Silver Spring, HHS purchased software and licenses for HP Open View Service Center, and then selected Northrop Grumman Information Technology via the National Institutes of Health Electronic Commodities Store III (NIH ECSIII) contract to provide support for installation and development. Service Center interacts with other installed software for network management and asset tracking to further automate the IT support functions of the HHS helpdesks. Service Center also interfaces with Knowlix, Knowledge Management software. By using Service Center as the help desk software, HHS moved toward a single helpdesk solution, which is in keeping with the "One HHS" vision. In addition to Service Center, HHS has begun adding the functionality of HP Open View Web to add a web-based problem solving and tracking solution to the already successful PC-based system. OEAD is currently deploying the web-based version to EHRP POC in the field. This enables customers to enter a trouble ticket without having to contact the helpdesk.</p>
<p>HHS was instructed to transition their payroll system and related functions to the Department of Defense (DOD), Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS), and Defense Civilian Pay System (DCPS). HHS already had a significant investment in HP Open View Service Center's local client and web as its problem ticket resolution tracking system. The project engineer conducted work sessions with HHS and DFAS representatives and collected information on their respective business processes. The project engineer then compiled technical requirements, which lead to an efficient interface design. The central enhancement consisted of bridging and synchronizing the HHS HP Open View Service Center and DFAS ticketing systems. The proposed bridge was successfully implemented in April 2005 and is still in use today.</p>
<p>World Wide Technologies (WWT) Inc. was approved as a sole source vendor based on their knowledge of HHS's implementation of the HP Open View software. In October 2006, WWT Inc. continued to support HHS by upgrading and enhancing the HP Open View Service Center incidents and requests tracking software from version 5.X to 6.X. World Wide Technologies Inc. built and implemented Activity and Trend Reports, on-demand reporting facility, an automated bridging operation for DFAS, and a data storage and archiving system to accommodate the growth in the number of future users, requests and ticket volume</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive proposal. No solicitation document is available. All responsible sources that have determined that they can provide the same services may submit product information and a capabilities statement addressing their specific abilities regarding this requirement. The email subject line must reference OS179954. All responses are due by Sept 4, 2016, 8:00 AM Eastern Time and can be sent to Kevin.Ceponis at kevin.ceponis@psc.hhs.gov . A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract base upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government</p>

BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION:

In accordance with 25 U.S.C. 3201 (P.L. 101-630), Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act; 42 U.S.C. 13041, Crime Control Act of 1990; 441 Departmental Manual, Personnel Security and Suitability Requirements all positions with duties and responsibilities involving regular contact with or control over Indian children are subject to a background investigation and determination of suitability for employment.

Accordingly, all such positions require a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program; and a favorable background investigation determination conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).

A favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of the Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program prior to contract award or made within 60 days of incorporation of this clause into a current/existing contract. Pending completion of a background investigation by OPM, the Contractor who has been granted a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be within the sight and under the supervision of a Government employee who has had a completed background investigation (42 U.S.C 13041 (3)) during contract performance until a final background investigation determination has been made.

Prior employment with the Federal Government, including BIA, OIEP or the Bureau of Indian Affairs, does not assure that the appropriate screening or investigation was conducted nor does it alleviate or guarantee a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination or background investigation.

Prior to an award or during the 60 day period discussed in paragraph two, it is solely the company, individual or contractor's responsibility to contact the BIA, OIEP Personnel Security and Suitability Program at 505-563-5287/5288/5289/5294 in order to obtain a complete security package, which includes but is not limited to appropriate investigative forms and/or inquire about their previous investigation; and, obtain a screening (applicant and suitability) determination, and subsequent final background investigation.

If an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination is made, a purchase order shall not be awarded to the individual who received an unfavorable screening or to the company who has proposed to employ the individual to perform the work. The individual and or the company who proposed to employ this individual may be determined to be non-responsible if an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determinations is made, which will make them ineligible for purchase order award. 

If an unfavorable final background investigation determination is made, the purchase order may be terminated and the employee in question shall not be authorized to provide service to the BIA, OIEP, if the services involve contact with or regular control over Indian children.

Award will be made on a Best Value Basis, whose quotation is conforming to the requirements herein, will be most advantageous to the Government, and is fair and reasonable. 

52.212-2  Evaluation-Commercial Items.
EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2014) 

(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
1.  Familiarity with location

3.  Past Performance
Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more than cost or price. 
(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

(s) Order of precedence. Any inconsistencies in this solicitation or contract shall be resolved by giving precedence in the following order: (1) The schedule of supplies/services; (2) The Assignments, Disputes, Payments, Invoice, Other Compliances, Compliance with Laws Unique to Government Contracts, and Unauthorized Obligations paragraphs of this clause; (3) The clause at 52.212-5; (4) Addenda to this solicitation or contract, including any license agreements for computer software; (5) Solicitation provisions if this is a solicitation; (6) Other paragraphs of this clause; (7) The Standard Form 1449; (8) Other documents, exhibits, and attachments; and (9) The specification. <BR> <BR>(t) System for Award Management (SAM) (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <BR> <BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <BR> <BR>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <BR> <BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. <BR> <BR>(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. <BR> <BR>(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: (1) 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons (FEB 2009) (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)).

<DESC>(i) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>(ii) The solicitation number is HHS-NIH-NIDA-SSSA-CSS-2016-633 and the solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ) on a competitive basis restricted to Small Business concerns.<br /> <br />This acquisition is for a commercial item or service and is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures; FAR Subpart 13.5-Test Program for Certain Commercial Items; and FAR Part 12-Acquisition of Commercial Items, and is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold of $150,000.00.  A fixed-price type contract is contemplated for any resulting contract entered into as a result of this solicitation.</p>
<p>(iii) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC Number/Effective Date:    FAC 2005-89 / 07-14-2016</p>
<p>(iv) The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 339112 Surgical and Medical Instrument Manufacturing with associated business size standard 1000 employees.<br /> <br />(v) Background<br />The Translational Gerontology Branch (TGB) in the Intramural Research Program (IRP) of the National Institute of Aging (NIA) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has a requirement for a Laser Doppler Imaging System for the measurement of hindlimb ischemia in mice. In order to study the mechanisms underlying muscle function and degeneration with age and disease it is important to be able to determine blood flow and level of impairment in a non-invasive in vivo way with studying mice and rats. The TGB does not currently have a capability to do this. A Laser Doppler Imaging System for measurement of hindlimb ischemia in mice will facilitate this need.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objective: The goal of this requirement is to obtain a Laser Doppler Imaging System capable of fulfilling essential features described herein.  One objective of TGB is to understand the basic biology of aging across species and to develop interventions that can improve health and lifespan and be translated to humans. The IRP is studying muscle function with aging and how disease states, such as peripheral artery disease and sarcopenia, affect blood flow and therefore muscle function. By understanding the mechanisms the TGB can develop treatments and interventions to prevent or delay the onset of these debilitating diseases. An essential requirement for the models that we are using is the measurement of blood flow to the affected limbs in our preclinical models (mice and rats).  The purpose of this acquisition is to obtain the Laser Doppler Imaging System for measurement of hindlimb ischemia in mice.</p>
<p>Product Description: Products offered must include those salient physical, functional, or other characteristics hereby identified as the essential government requirements needing to be achieved. Specifically, products offered shall contain the ability to achieve the following essential features: <br />1. Laser Doppler Imaging System to measure hindlimb ischemia in mice in small area, high resolution, single wavelength 2.5mW; <br />2. 1 x V2 785nm scan head with built in CCD camera; <br />3. Fine pixel resolution of at least 100 &micro;m; <br />4. Superior penetration that allows for imaging of collateral vessel formation in a non-invasive measurement.</p>

<DESC>(i) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>(ii) The solicitation number is HHS-NIH-NIDA-SSSA-CSS-2016-626 and the solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ) on a competitive basis restricted to Small Business concerns.<br /> <br />This acquisition is for a commercial item or service and is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures; FAR Subpart 13.5-Test Program for Certain Commercial Items; and FAR Part 12-Acquisition of Commercial Items, and is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold of $150,000.00.  A fixed-price type contract is contemplated for any resulting contract entered into as a result of this solicitation.</p>
<p>(iii) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC Number/Effective Date:    FAC 2005-89 / 07-14-2016</p>
<p>(iv) The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 - Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing with associated business size standard 1000 employees.<br /> <br />(v) Background<br />The RNA Regulation Section (RRS) in the Intramural Research Program (IRP) of the National Institute of Aging (NIA) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is contained within the Laboratory of Genetics (LG) and is driven by the long-term goal to elucidate the mechanisms that regulate gene expression in aging physiology and pathology.  RRS focuses on age-related changes in gene expression controlled at the post-transcriptional level by RNA-binding proteins and noncoding RNAs (both microRNAs and long noncoding RNAs). The central hypothesis of the program is that post-transcriptional gene regulation governs the normal physiologic decline seen with advancing age, as well as the aberrant gene expression patterns that underlie age-associated disease. This hypothesis is investigated by focusing on the following research areas: cellular senescence, age-related changes in energy metabolism, carcinogenesis, and neurodegeneration.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objective: The goal of this requirement is to obtain an instrument for Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM) purposes. LCM is an automated sample preparation technique that enables isolation of specific cells from a mixed population under microscopic visualization. This technique of isolating a pure sample from a heterogeneous mixture allows for more efficient and accurate results with downstream microgenomics applications. The isolation and characterization of specific cells from a heterogeneous cell population is important for the analysis of gene expression because the differences between various cell types present within normal tissues have significant effects on gene expression analysis. LCM allows one to obtain answers in a single cell that may otherwise have been missed in a mixed cell population.  The LCM technique can be used to isolate just a few cells or even a single cell from tissue samples or other heterogenous cellular mixtures, depending on the application. The cells can be chosen on the basis of their morphology, immunohistochemical phenotype, or even their genotype, using in situ hybridization methods. The RNA Regulation Section conducts research interested in RNA subpopulations.  With information resulting from samples, it is often a concern that larger populations are contaminating, or interfering with localized RNA , thus masking the actual role of these important molecules.  The LCM utilizing instrument will more accurately identify these populations without the distractions of outlying cells.</p>
<p>Product Description: Products offered must include those salient physical, functional, or other characteristics hereby identified as the essential government requirements needing to be achieved. Specifically, products offered shall contain the ability to achieve the following essential features:</p>
<p>The Contractor shall deliver and install LCM instrument with hands on training. Specifically, the contractor shall provide the subject instrument meeting the following essential features:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).<br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.
