I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

Background:

The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL)/RI, in conjunction with the Office of Naval Research (ONR), is soliciting white papers for a new research program with the title, the Software Systems Stockroom (S3).

The increased complexity and diversity of computational devices and systems is reflected in a corresponding increase in the difficulty in developing software for these systems.  These difficulties are compounded by the dramatic increases in scale and scope of information processing applications due to the availability of networked heterogeneous distributed systems.  All of these effects have exacerbated the challenges that system engineers face in trying to specify, design, build, verify and test software.  A number of codified approaches are available that utilize a technological framework for defining systems, expressing requirements, classifying components, validating systems and their components, and disseminating the results.  However, these approaches have demonstrated point solutions with a limited ability to mitigate risks with limited success.

Complexity and diversity in computational systems is an issue in information technology in general, but the unique combination of reliability, robustness, security, interoperability, and real-time operation requirements that military systems must satisfy set them sharply apart from non-military applications.  To successfully mitigate risks, approaches require community involvement, and a social framework for participation, discussion and a means for gaining community approval of new technologies.  Solutions to the increased complexity and diversity of computational devices and systems require a sustained commitment by the community to devise technologies that can be used for system design and the development of general use tools.  A software library is such a tool that is used to help develop applications by providing services and offering modularity, portability and efficiency of the code.  Libraries follow the principles of encapsulation and separation of concerns allowing programmers to add functionality.  Such tools strive to reduce complexity by providing a shared common resource, with a shared vocabulary, a shared understanding, and a shared culture of its use.   Furthermore, libraries can become an authoritative and trusted reference for software system development with the right framework and smart dedicated community effort.

Objective:

White papers are being solicited that propose a foundational reference architecture for an open framework environment that enables researchers to develop, analyze, and classify their software components and designs.  Additionally, the open framework environment will facilitate transition of promising technologies into production use.  The framework should include software and systems components and products of various degrees of pedigree residing together with appropriate role-based access controls and mechanisms that allow accounting for resources, the generation of system components, and documented case studies of their application to specific projects.  This open framework environment should: have similar features to an interactive library or repository; facilitate evolutionary change; promote the understanding of the resources available within the repository; and provide mechanisms for applying the resources to system development work. The framework should incorporate technology to evaluate, implement, monitor, verify, and prove components.

The open framework environment will facilitate the adoption and development of new technologies, methodologies, and theories in support of the Software-Intensive Systems Producibility Initiative.  The open framework environment will also facilitate the design and construction of research products and methods across a range of platforms and software systems, provide capability to allow universities and industry to leverage technology development, and will establish a capability for successful technology transition and transfer.

Research Concentration Areas:

CONOPS:  The document that outlines a concept of operations (CONOPS) should be written to communicate overall quantitative and qualitative system characteristics to the user, developer, stakeholders and other organizational elements.  It should describe an open system framework, operational policies, classes of users, interactions among users, and organizational objectives from an integrated systems point of view.  Under another Software-Intensive Systems Producibility Initiative (SISPI) effort, the Systems and Software Producibility Collaboration and Evaluation Environment (SPRUCE) seeks to provide an open collaborative research and development environment to demonstrate, evaluate, and document the ability of novel tools, methods, techniques, and run-time technologies to yield more predictable production of software intensive systems.  SPRUCE should be leveraged where possible.  In particular, the CONOPS should address:

Community and Technical Specialization.  The S3 should focus on a technical area for which there is an active research and applications community, supportive of systematic standardization and codification of tools, techniques and practices at the component level.  A plan to engage and involve a wider community including industry, government, and academia must be provided.  Areas of general interest and their specializations include but are not limited to: verification, signal and image processing, protocols, parallel and distributed algorithms, operating systems, and discrete mathematics.

Classifications and Taxonomies.   Innovative approaches are sought for describing software systems components, their interrelationships, functional and non-functional dependencies, the construction environment, and that address complexity, derivations, invariants, signatures, provenance, traceability, provability, and attestations.  The taxonomies devised should facilitate understanding and classifying behaviors and properties that arise from combining components.  Of particular interest are systematic correct-by-construction derivations of components for classification and taxonomic structure.

Information Provenance and Intellectual Property.  The open framework should support laws and policies governing the use of digital intellectual property of data, software, systems and their derivations as transparently as possible for all stakeholders.

Architecture.  The architecture must include the architectural description as appropriate not only for an open-system architecture but also for the supporting roles and responsibilities affecting the use and construction of that architecture.  The architectural definition should provide the ability to understand and control those elements of system design that capture the system’s utility, cost and risks.  The definition shall provide a rigorous definition of what constitutes the fundamental organization embodying all information regarding elemental relations, interactions, and interfaces.  In addition, an extended architecture should provide a structured framework for such items as accounts of success and failures, benchmarks, quantitative and qualitative results from assessments of usage, and forensic studies of software disasters that help define problems and basic research areas.  Of particular interest are issues concerning the semantics of an “interface” and the information provided at an interface.

User Interface and Usability.  The style of interfaces affects overall usability.  Scenarios that illustrate the salient features and their use should be provided in a storyboard style.

Technology Diffusion and the Developer Community.  A plan to involve the community of developers (especially, compiler developers) must be provided.  The plan should promote principles of interoperability, transparency, and accountability, encourage the use of the open framework and its resources, and engage vendors.

Collaboration.  Teaming, joint projects, and in-kind cooperation are encouraged especially when competing commercial interests find common ground to address DoD and community-wide needs.

Metrics.  The major characteristics of the S3 and its usage are to be assessed and measured among others for accuracy, consistency, completeness, organization, transparency, trustedness, and usability.

International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and export control issues.  These laws are to be enforced in the S3 at all times when sensitive material is involved.

Program Phases:

This program will be competed in two Phases.  Phase I will be the definition phase and will consist of defining, developing, and documenting the Concept of Operations (CONOPS), a user-oriented document that describes system characteristics for a proposed system from the users' viewpoint; and defining, developing and documenting fundamental principles for organizing knowledge, supporting architectures, as embodied in its components, their relationships to each other and the environment, and the principles governing its design and evolution.  Initial concepts along with the final CONOPS and architectures will be presented to representatives from Government, Industry, and Academia; and, the technical data rights proposed need to be consistent with this requirement.   Phase II will be the environmental development and operations phase.  Additional information will be issued around the April 2009 timeframe concerning Phase II and white papers for Phase II will be solicited at that time.

Phase I is the area for which white papers are currently solicited.

Anticipated Schedule for Phase 1 Activities:

The Definition Phase will begin with a kickoff workshop and proceed with a several month CONOPS and Architecture development for the S3.  A review workshop will be held mid-way through the Phase I effort during which the initial concepts will be briefed to representatives from Government, Industry and Academia who have been invited to review the ideas and provide feedback.  The final months should be devoted to completing the initial concepts and incorporating comments from the review workshop.   A final review workshop will be held in the final month, at which time the final CONOPS and Architectures will be presented to representatives from Government, Industry and Academia invited to review the ideas and provide feedback.

Phase 1 awardees will be required to present the full extent of their work at both a mid-term and a final workshop, attendance at which will not be limited to only the Government and awardees.

Phase 1 work will provide the basis for the Phase 2 solicitation, and will be used both by the Government for definition of the Phase 2 addendum, and as a repository available for Phase 2 offerors use.  Therefore, the technical data rights proposed need to be consistent with these requirements.  Additional information will be provided as a modification to this BAA to initiate Phase 2, which will consist of the Development and Operations phase.  This modification is anticipated to be issued around the April 2009 timeframe.

II. AWARD INFORMATION:

Total funding for this BAA is approximately $4.9M.  The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows:  FY 08 - $1M; FY 09 - $1.3M; FY 10 - $1.3M; and FY 11- $1.3M.

White papers will be accepted until 2pm Eastern time on 30 March 2011, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.

4.  FUNDING RESTRICTIONS:  The cost of preparing white papers/proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18. Incurring pre-award costs for ASSISTANCE INSTRUMENTS ONLY, are regulated by the DoD Grant and Agreements Regulations (DODGARS).

5.  OTHER SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:  DO NOT send white papers to the Contracting Officer.  All responses to this announcement must be addressed to:

Steven.Drager@rl.af.mil
Attn: Mr. Steven Drager

V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:

1.  CRITERIA:  The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:

(1)	Overall Scientific and Technical Merit. The technical concepts should be clearly defined and carefully developed.  Emphasis should be placed on the technical excellence, creativity, and innovation of the development and the usability of the proposed technology, which include the architecture, interoperability, and methodology to broaden participation of the technical community. 
(2)	Collaboration and Information Sharing. The offeror must demonstrate a high level of commitment with detailed plans for collaboration among all major relevant parties.  Moreover, the offeror must provide plans for sharing results with the broader community and encouraging participating of team and non-team members alike in evaluations and information dissemination.
(3)	Related Experience.  The white paper will be judged on the extent to which the offeror demonstrates technical knowledge and competency in relevant domains of software technologies, balance of the skills set of the team, excellence of the academic-industry team members, experience with government contracts, and proven capability to conduct innovative practical research.  Of particular importance is acumen in the unique challenges of integration and development, anticipated in the near to far term.
(4)	Openness and Maturity of Solution. - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged, the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and previous demonstration of capability to accomplish the proposed tasks.
(5)	Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).

No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers or proposals.  Individual white papers and proposals will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA.  White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors.  Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals.  Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.

VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission.

2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:

Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a TOP SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to TOP SECRET information at the time of award.  In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA.  Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.

A Phase 1 awardee will have to present the full extent of its work at a mid-term and at a final workshop, attendance at which will not be limited to only the Government and awardees.  Also, the Phase 1 work will provide the basis for the Phase 2 solicitation, and be used both by the Government for definition of the Phase 2 addendum, and as a repository available for Phase 2 offerors to use.  Therefore, the technical data rights proposed need to be consistent with these requirements.

3. REPORTING:  Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS.  Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.

VII.  AGENCY CONTACTS:

Questions of a technical nature shall be directed to the cognizant technical point of contact, as specified below:

      TPOC Name:  Steven Drager

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award on a sole source basis, under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures, FAR Part 13, a firm fixed price award to IMS Health, 660 West Germantown Pike, Plymouth, PA  19462 for data to support the development of U.S. expenditure estimates for prescriptions drugs in the National Health Expenditure Accounts from IMS Health. IMS Health will provide 2006 and 2007 data from the National Prescription Audit for the number of new prescriptions, number of refill prescriptions, pharmaceutical acquisition dollars and total retail dollars.  This data should be provided by all channels of distribution (i.e., data for chain drugs stores, independent stores, mail order, and food stores.  The IMS National Prescription Audit data was determined to be the most comprehensive source of prescription drug information on the market.  No other data set could approach the reliability and consistency of those offered by IMS Health.  The large number of retail pharmacies that report to IMS (a 20,000 pharmacy sample), the innovative computer design used to collect the data, and the use of sophisticated sampling techniques employed makes their database a superior one.

<DESC>The VA Medical Center in Cincinnati Ohio intends to negotiate a sole source contract with FEI Company of Hillsboro, Oregon for Louis Stokes Cleveland VAMC for a Preventative Maintenance Service Agreement for its TECNAI 10 Electron Microscope and Camera System.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 334411 and the Small Business Standard is 1000 employees. The Government believes that FEI Company is the only manufacture that can satisfy these requirements. Therefore, the Government intends to proceed with a sole source procurement for the required services. This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR 6.302 - only one responsible source and no other vendor will satisfy agency requirements. To the best of our knowledge, FEI Company of Hillsboro, Oregon is the only source that provides the above indicated items and features. This is a notice of intent to sole source and is not a request for competitive bids. However, any firm that believes it can meet these requirements may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within ten (10) calendar days from the date of publication of this synopsis.	Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate 	compliance.  Telephone and facsimile requests/inquiries will not be accepted. 		Information may be sent electronically to lonnie.winkler@va.gov, by fax to (513) 	475-6334, or by mail to: Contracting Officer, VA Medical Center, and 3200 Vine 	Street, Cincinnati, Ohio 45220.  Responses received will be evaluated however; a 	determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based 	upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  	Responses must be received by April 21, 2008 specified in this notice to be 	considered. If no responses are received, the 	Cincinnati VA Medical Center will 	precede with the sole source negotiation with FEI Company of Hillsboro, Oregon.

<DESC>The Tactical Technology Office (TTO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting abstracts (white papers) and proposals for advanced research and development of Innovative Systems for Military Missions.  Innovative Systems are integrated systems or critical systems components, which often incorporate emerging advanced technologies, and which enable revolutionary improvements to the efficiency and effectiveness of the military. 

TTO seeks responses relating to five (5) Mission Thrust Areas (“Mission Thrusts”):

- Space Operations
- Land, Air, Sea and Space Platforms
- Unmanned Systems
- Directed Energy
- Precision Strike

Responses to the thrust areas may be submitted at any time during the open period of this solicitation. 

TTO's solicitation focuses on the high risk/high payoff development, integration, demonstration and evaluation of innovative systems or critical systems components enabled by, and incorporating, new or emerging technologies. Proposed efforts must also show significant promise to provide the U.S. military with revolutionary new mission capabilities, and/or enable significant increases in mission effectiveness.

Innovative system concepts of interest to TTO typically address emerging technical opportunities, advanced systems concepts, emergent threats, and/or new technology-enabled concepts of operation. TTO strongly encourages respondents to adopt a complete systems engineering approach to the problems.

This BAA solicits both abstracts (white papers) and proposals for proposed efforts. Offerors are strongly encouraged to initially submit a six page abstract (white paper) describing the offerors proposed concept.  Submission of an abstract (white paper) is not required prior to submitting a full proposal.

In their submitted abstracts (white papers) or proposals, offerors should specifically and clearly address both the innovation of their proposed system or subsystem component development, and its impact on military mission efficiency and/or effectiveness.

Offerors are encouraged to review and monitor TTO’s public web site at http://www.darpa.mil/TTO in order to better understand past and recent TTO mission systems development efforts.

<DESC>LIDAR Services- Furnish aerial photographic services and related supplies in accordance with the requirements, specifications, terms, conditions specified herein. This will be an Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Qauntity contract for three years.  Up to three contractors will be awarded master contracts.  Two task orders will also be awarded at the time of original award. 

The general scope is to procure vertical aerial photography to typically support stream surveys, vegetation management, restoration projects, pre- and post-project monitoring, site design, post fire planning, natural resource inventory, orthophotography, and extraction of data by means of photogrammetric measurements. 

Aerial Camera Specifications: 
Tested and calibrated precision aerial cameras for taking aerial photographs are required. Only camera systems which meet the requirements of these specifications, as determined by a current USGS “Report of Calibration” test report, shall be used.  A camera system “Report of Calibration” will not be acceptable if more than three (3) years old at the scheduled date for receipt of offers.  
Lens Focal Length primarily needed is the 12 inch (305mm) and 8 ¼ inch (210mm).
Filters used should be antivignetting for normal color film or a yellow filter for color infrared (CIR).

Camera Operation:
The camera and its mount shall be checked for proper installation prior to each mission.
Particular attention shall be given to electrical circuits which control fiducial and camera data box lights and to the vacuum supply. In conformance with conventional photogrammetric practice, it is the preference of the Government that the contractor use camera configurations, that when installed in the aircraft, advance film parallel to the line of flight. The camera mount shall be regularly serviced and maintained and shall be insulated against aircraft vibration.

Camera Accessories:
An automatic exposure control device is permitted, but a manual override capability is required for some types of terrain to achieve proper exposure.

Aerial Film: 
Kodak 2444 Aerocolor III Negative or equal. Kodak 1443 infrared film or equal when color infrared is requested. All aerial film used on a project item shall be from one film type and manufacturer and be purchased by the Contractor. Extreme care shall be exercised to insure proper exposure and processing of film to minimize vignetting due to differential exposure. This differential shall not exceed that which would result from a basic ¼ stop difference in exposure.
All aerial film shall be free from chemicals, stains, tears, scratches, abrasions, water marks, finger marks, lint, dirt, and other physical defects. The imagery shall be clear and sharp in detail and uniform in density. It shall be free from light streaks, static marks, and other defects that would interfere with the intended purpose. All film shall be thoroughly fixed and washed to insure freedom from chemicals and shall be of archival quality.
Storage, exposure, and handling of all photographic materials shall be in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendation. The film shall not be rolled tightly on spools or in any way stretched, buckled, distorted, or exposed to excessive heat.

Maximum Film Roll Length:  200 feet.

Approximate Photographic Period: May 1 through September 30

Minimum Sun Angle: 
50 Degrees. Photography shall be undertaken only during that portion of the day when the sun angle exceeds the minimum specified.

Terrain Conditions:
The ground cover is mostly forest and mountainous terrain.

Photographic Conditions:
Photography shall be undertaken when skies are clear, free from smoke, clouds, cloud shadows, excessive haze, and well-defined images can be resolved. The ground shall be free from snow below timberline.

Overlaps:
Endlap: Optimum 62%, Minimum 57%, Maximum 67% 
Sidelap: Optimum 30%, Minimum 20%, Maximum 45%
                                                                                                                                    
Horizontal Deviation: 
Deviation from the plotted position of the flight line in excess of five (5) percent of a full print may cause rejection of any or all of the flight line.

Scale Deviation: 
Deviation from the Official Scale will be no more than 25%.

Crab: 
Any series of two or more photographs crabbed in excess of five degrees (5°) as measured between photographs in line and between adjoining lines may cause rejection of any or all of that particular flight line.

Tilt:
 Exposure made with the optical axis of the camera in a vertical position is desired. Tilt (departure from the vertical) on any exposure exceeding four degrees (4º) or relative tilt between any two successive exposures exceeding six degrees (6°) may be cause for rejection of any or all of the flight line.

Flight Plan Data:
The Contractor will be furnished the Official Flight Plan Data. The Official Flight Plan Data will determine project location, flight direction, datum breaks, and the flight altitude of each line above mean sea level. The Contractor will be furnished the latitude and longitude coordinates, expressed in degrees, minutes, seconds, and decimal seconds, of all beginning and ending terminal points of project flight lines. Data shall be in ASCII text format.  Small locator maps will also be provided.

Film Titling: 
Identifying data shall be placed in line along the most northerly flight edge of the aerial exposures of north-south flights and shall be placed along the western edge of the exposure in east-west flights. Flights along streams or NW, NE, SW, SE lines shall be titled on the upstream edge or the highest terrain edge. Titling shall include Flight Date, Government Agency (USFS), Photo Scale, Project Code, Run Number (no longer use the roll number) and Exposure Number (Number in unbroken series beginning with 1, not 001 or 01.).  In addition, the local standard time of exposure (PST) shall be titled on first and last exposure of each flight line and at each break in flight line, including breaks due to reflights.

Example:
8-8-08          10:14            USFS             1:6000          08026-SIU                1-1
 (Date)          (Time)         (Agency)        (Scale)       ( Project Code)      (Run #-Exposure#)
                     
The characters used in titling shall be standard block lettering 6.35mm (1/4 inch) high. They shall be sharp, legible, and uniformly applied with non-flaking black ink. The titling shall be placed on the non-emulsion side of the film and may be applied by use of an ink drawing pen or stamp. No smears or transfer of marking ink to other parts of the film roll will be permitted.

Prints:
Photographic papers of proper contrast must be used in making suitable prints to bring out all the details of the film image including clear identification of fiducials.  Full size (9”x 9”, 23cm x 23cm) color contacts must be printed for the best detail and color variances in riparian vegetation, stream channel debris, soils, and forest canopy.  Prints must be properly developed and thoroughly fixed and washed. They must be clean and free from stains, blemishes, uneven spots, air bells, fog, and finger marks.

Digital Photo Data File: 
Contractor shall prepare a digital photo-center data file for all aerial photography acquired under this solicitation. The file(s) shall be provided in ASCII comma delimited text format. A comma delimited header line (Project Description) shall precede the data in each file as shown in the example below.

<DESC>*******************Contact Elizabeth Mudler/DFS at elizabeth.e.mudler@nasa.gov orvia fax 256-544-4401*********** NASA/MSFC has a requirement for FABRICATION OF ABLATIVE NOZZEL. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from ATK Launch Systems Inc on a sole sourcebasis. NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) is undertaking an effort to advance the state ofthe art of pressure-fed liquid oxygen (LOX)/Methane (CH4) rocket engines for in-spaceapplications. This work is a part of the Propulsion and Cryogenics Advanced Development(PCAD) Project and supported by the NASA Exploration Technology Development Program(ETDP). The PCAD Project has been chartered to raise the state-of-the-art of LOX/CH4pressure-fed engines to a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) suitable for incorporationinto Constellation spacecraft. The effort requires the contractor to procure necessary materials to tape wrap, bag,cure, and overwrap the forward chamber and nozzle extension, as well as fabricate andinstall attachment rings. The resultant full length ablative nozzle will be used foraltitude testing at White Sands test facility in support of LOx/CH4 injector developmenttesting for the Propulsion and Cryogenics Advance Development (PCAD) project. The purposeof this testing is to support the ongoing LOX/Methane Advanced Development taskssupporting the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV).	The LOX/Methane injector program is aGovernment-led in-house development program.  The proposed effort will be conductedjointly with ATK SEHO personnel and civil servants onsite at MSFC.  Government personnelwill benefit from participating in and observing the proposed effort as part of acritical skills retention/development/training program.  MSFC will provide the necessaryequipment, and facilities to support the proposed effort. This recommendation is made pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, which implements the authority for10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) for acquisition of supplies or services from only one source and noother supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Competition is impracticalfor the following reasons:1.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce (DOC), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) has a requirement to contract a research vessel and operator to conduct two research cruises in the Dry Tortugas region of Southwest, FL (SE Gulf of Mexico) in May and June of 2008.  Cruise operations will be conducted over a total of 20 days and will support scuba-based surveys of reef fish, macroinvertebrates, other benthic fauna, and habitat characteristics.  This research will facilitate the (1) assessment of natural system variability versus change result in from implementation of ?no take? spatial management zones recently implemented in the Dry Tortugas region; (2) assessment of correlations between spatially explicit multispecies abundance and biomass data with relevant biophysical structure; and (3) modeling of linkages between coral reef fishery resources and key environmental ?habitat? features.  The contracted vessels shall support the following activities:  Operations shall be conducted in and around the Dry Tortugas near 24.5 degrees North and 083.0 degrees West.  Biological data will be collected by SCUBA divers using non-destructive, in situ, fishery independent visual monitoring methods.  The scientific investigators are uniquely qualified to conduct this research based on past research and experience in the study area.  The proposed sampling survey will obtain about 1500 visual census point samples over a short period to provide a spatially integrated ?snapshot? of the exploited reef fish community three (3) years after Tortugas marine reserves were impacted by several hurricanes.  This work requires a labor-intensive effort with no shortcuts to ensure that sampling is cost-effective and precise.  At a rate of 4-6 reef fish visual census samples per diver per day (depending on depth) a minimum of 20 field days of ship support are required to provide sufficient spatial coverage.  By sampling both in and out of the marine reserves throughout the Tortugas region, science divers will provide:  (1) spatially explicit estimates of population abundance and biomass by size (age) groups for both exploited species essential for quantitative stock assessments; and (2) statistical characterization reef ?habitats? in terms of nursery and population-productivity value.  The estimated dates of cruises are as follows unless both parties agree to changes: May 11, May 12-21, May 22, May 30, May 31-June 9, 2008.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 488390 and size standard is 6.5 million.

<DESC>This contract is for the purpose of restoring irrigation water to the Hanksville Irrigation Company.     A flood event in October 2006 washed out the existing irrigation dam in the Fremont River leaving the water users without means of diverting water to approximately 800 acres of irrigated fields.
The items of work required include the construction of a new  concrete diversion dam in the corridor of the Fremont River approximately 2 miles upstream of the community of Hanksville.     Additional components of the diversion structure and delivery system include a rock raceway for fish passage at the diversion structure, a concrete sediment sluicing structure, HDPE irrigation pipeline, and a new concrete water control structure at the downstream end of the pipeline for delivering water to the existing irrigation ditches.     The water control structure will also incorporate a suspended pipe bridge over the river providing water to a portion of the irrigated farmland opposite the water control structure.

As the diversion structure is in the river itself and portions of the irrigation pipeline are at the edge of the active river corridor, rock armament will be required in order to protect and sustain the life span of the proposed engineering practices.


THIS IS NOT SET-ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES.
THIS WILL BE COMPETED FULL-OPEN COMPETITION.

<DESC>The Fleet & Industrial Supply Center (FISC) Norfolk, Contracting Department, Philadelphia Office intends to procure on a sole source basis from Spacesavers Systems, Inc. of Kensington, MD the acquisition and installation of high-density mobile shelving units for the Navy Historical Center, Washington, DCs Operational Archives Branch and Navy Department Library which maintain archives of documents, photographs, and books that are invaluable historical assets used to tell the story of naval history and its heritage.
Spacesavers mobile shelving rail system will provide long term performance because they use one-piece solid steel rail sections which prevent delamination and separation of multiple rail components. All other vendors use multiple-piece rails that are butt joined and do not have the anticipated life of the proposed vendors rails. Also, Spacesavers is the only system that drives its carriages from both sides and both ends.  This balanced drive system virtually eliminates the tendency for carriages to twist and bind as with a drive shaft system that drives wheels on only one side of the carriage. No other vendors mobile shelving units provide this precise of a drive system. 
The anticipated award date is on or around 1 Jul 08 with delivery and final installation required 240 days after date of contract. A firm fixed price contract is anticipated. The acquisition shall be processed using the Simplified Acquisition Procedures under the test program for commercial items found at FAR 13.5.
The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 337215.  The solicitation will be made available electronically upon its release, which is anticipated on or about 1 May 08 at the NECO web address: www.neco.navy.mil.
The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, as implemented by FAR 13.501(a). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit a quotation. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, all proposals received within 30 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Interested parties may download the RFQ from the NECO website and are solely responsible for monitoring the above-mentioned website for posting. 
Quoters shall be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to be considered for award. See www.ccr.gov for further information and instructions. In addition, quoters are required to go-online to the Business Partner Network at http://orca.bpn.gov to complete their Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) prior to submittal of a quotation.

This part requires engineering source approval by the design controlactivity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique designcapability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualifiedsource(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). Theapproved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technicaldata that are not economically available to the Government, and the data orknowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternatesource must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures,as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualificationprocedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity havingjurisdiction over the part in the intended application.The subject item requiresGovernment source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flightcritical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate tosupport acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previouslyapproved by the government for this item have been solicited. The time requiredfor approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayedpending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you mustsubmit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the"https://www.neco.navy.mil/sar.cfm" Naval Inventory Control Point PhiladelphiaSource Approval Information Brochure. This brochure identifies technical datarequired to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of thesame or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. If your requestfor source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVICP-P, submit with youroffer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for sourceapproval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the SourceApproval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by theSource Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under thissolicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submittedhereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude theability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, awardof the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs. The NAVICPCommercial Item Identification Brochure is now available at:"https://www.neco.navy.mil/sar.cfm". Drawings not available. -SEE NOTES 9, 22,26

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Joint Munitions & Lethality Life Cycle Management Command (JM&L LCMC) Acquisition Center at Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000 intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the procurement of an XM205 Lightweight Tripod for Heavy Machine Guns.  This system shall be capable of mounting to both the M2/M2A1.50 Caliber Machine Gun and the MK19 Grenade Machine Gun (GMG).  This procurement is a 100% small business set-aside.  An Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) with two (2) Options will be utilized.  Additional information will be provided in the RFP. The lightweight tripod system will reduce the weight and size burden of the M3 tripod yet enable the soldier to deliver a high degree of accurate fire from a stable base.  The XM205 Machine Gun Tripod shall have the following characteristics: 1) Weight no more than 31 lbs (T); 25 lbs (O). 2) The tripod must be capable of mounting both the M2 .50 Caliber and MK19 machine guns without the need for special/unauthorized adapters.  The tripod shall be compatible with the standard, current machine gun mounts and pintles (e.g. MK93 Carriage and Cradle; NSN 1010-01-502-7547, .50 Cal Machine Gun pintle; NSN 1010-01-151-6217.)  The tripod components shall interface with the current mounting locations of the M2 .50 Cal MG or MK19 GMG without permanent modifications to these mounting features.  Non-permanent adaptors made to the weapons are acceptable. 3) A Traverse and Elevation (T&E) mechanism that is integral to the tripod. The T&E mechanism shall permit controlled manipulation in both traverse and elevation by hand force of the User, allow for rapid and bold adjustment throughout the full range of traverse and elevation, and 1 mil fine adjustment capability.  A self-contained unit that provides position (elevation and azimuth) display is desired. 4) A T&E that allows for rapid and bold adjustment.  T&E display provides weapon elevation and azimuth during bold adjustments. 5) The tripod shall collapse to less than 50% of its deployed width and height for ease of transportation.  Overall length and width of the LTHMG shall not exceed 45 inches and 7.75 inches (not including the width across feet on tripod legs) respectively in the collapsed configuration.  The tripod shall capable of being folded, collapsed or otherwise reduced in size, without disassembly, into a compact package for storage and transporting during Airborne operations. 6) Have a geometry that takes advantage of the full range and versatility of the M2 .50 Caliber and MK19 machine guns and allows the weapons to maintain consistent elevation/depression throughout the full range of weapon traverse. The deployed height of the tripod shall have a minimum height to accommodate firing from the sitting and prone positions. This is not an RFP; the release of a RFP is antcipated on or about 3 March 2008.  Questions shall be submitted in writing to the U.S. Army JM&L LCMC, Attn: Yasmine Clanton, Contract Specialist, at yasmine.clanton@us.army.mil. TELEPHONE INQUIRES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. See note 1

10 Dec 07: The purpose of this post is to provide Industry the current status on the JTC TRS Program.  See attached file labeled JTC TRS status 10 Dec 2007.pdf.
*******************************************PROGRAM SCOPE: The Joint Terminal Controller Training and Rehearsal System (JTC TRS) project under the Tactical Airborne Control System funds developments necessary to provide Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) capable high-fidelity Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC), and Combat Control Team (CCT) training and rehearsal system. The JTC TRS will be able to connect to DMO networks to allow geographically separated high-fidelity close air support platforms and JTACs/CCT teams to train together. The JTC TRS will enable operators to conduct Joint Close Air Support (JCAS) training/mission rehearsal using tailored, dynamic scenarios that are relevant to mission tasking. Furthermore, the system will be capable of providing air traffic control training for CCT using tactical application of austere airbase operations. Using a system of systems approach JTC TRS shall have the capability to network in Increment 1 to aircrew full mission trainers and mission training centers, and by Increment 2, to Air Support Operations Centers (ASOCs) for Joint Tactical Air Strike Requests and air-ground coordination of Joint fires. JTC TRS will also allow JTACS/CCT teams to use their actual equipment in the trainer. Its primary focus is to provide a persistent total air-ground virtual training environment for networked air ground training and mission rehearsal capability that will develop both JTAC/CCT skills and train those air crews assigned to accomplish complex JCAS missions in close proximity to ground forces. JTC TRS will be fully interoperable with joint/sister Service air ground simulation using industry standards. SEE BELOW ATTACHMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

Fire suppression is defined as all work and activities connected with fire extinguishing operations beginning with discovery and continuing until the fire is completely extinguished.  Proposal Area: Western Oregon BLM Districts (2.4 million acres).  The State of Oregon, Department of Forestry, has been selected to provided the needed support as they are the only contractor known to possess the following unique qualifications needed to meet the Bureau's requirements: (1) ability to perform fire protection on 2.4 million acres of BLM-managed land interspersed throughout 17 million acres of State, public and private ownership; (2) ability to plan and conduct an effective fire prevention program throughout western Oregon, directed at all age groups, including both public and industrial activities; (3) ability to plan and conduct an effective fire detection program throughout western Oregon, utilizing ground and aerial detection methods, as well as operating a facility to receive calls from the public, screen reports from all sources against allowable incidences of fire, and to report to the Bureau at least 75% of all unwanted fires within 2 hours of origin, or prior to reaching 0.5 acre in size; (4) ability to plan and conduct an effective initial attack and fire suppression program throughout western Oregon to control unwanted fires before they exceed 10 acres in size, and manage all fires under the Incident Command System, and perform rehabilitation of lands damaged by the fire suppression effort; (5) ability to provide personnel that meet the qualifications and operational standards identified in the Wildland Fire Qualifications Guide, National Wildfire Coordinating Group (NWCG) Publication 310-1; (6) ability to investigate the scene of fires and make authoritative determinations regarding cause which lead to successful collection of suppression costs; and (7) ability to assume financial responsibility for fire suppression costs from non-BLM caused fires that exceed initial attack.

We estimate the shipping volume to have been 37,044 cubic feet.<br />The Department of State, Bureau of Diplomatic Security, Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Countermeasures Division is looking for sources to provide logistic services in the Northern Virginia area. The WMD Program includes training and equipping personnel at embassies and consulates overseas and at Department of State (DOS) domestic locations in order to counter the threat of a chemical, biological or radiological attack.

<p>This will be a 100% 8(a) set aside for small business.</p>
<p>The Government has no objections to teaming.</p>

<DESC><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) is conducting a Sources Sought/Market Survey to locate Small Business, Veteran Owned, HUBZone and 8(a) Firms under NAICS Code 541990 &ldquo;All Other Professional, Scientific and Technical Services.&rdquo; Provider(s) must be capable of developing a model infant audiology diagnostic protocol using telemedicine, which could be adopted in other areas to assist professionals and families by providing diagnostic services in rural areas while limiting expenditures.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><font face="Times New Roman">In general, telemedicine is used to bridge service gaps, including specialty provider and equipment shortages, in rural and underserved areas, which can include large metropolitan areas. While audiology as a profession has been slow to adopt telemedicine, this form of service delivery is becoming more feasible and practical as the availability of inexpensive interactive video systems evolves and if there is increased availability of governmental funding to develop programs. In addition, preliminary projects and research suggest that telemedicine models which might be effective for audiologists, expediting patient care, in a cost efficient manner, delivering hearing services to locations where none exists. This is vital because diagnostic audiology needs to occur between the ages of one to three months, after a baby fails to pass a follow-up re-screen. However, only half of the infants referred are generally evaluated, due to the shortage of pediatric audiologists and equipment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Data show that an infant with a significant hearing impairment who receives intervention by six months of age will perform significantly better in language development than the infant who is identified after six months of age.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">The use of tele-audiology has not been demonstrated, although it has been discussed for some time.&nbsp; Proposed is placement of diagnostic equipment in a spoke site of an existing telemedicine network.&nbsp;Typically in telemedicine practice, nurses, physician&rsquo;s assistants or perhaps EEG technicians are taught to use the equipment.&nbsp; Audiologists at the hub site would observe the correct use of the equipment,&nbsp;interpret results and interact with families.&nbsp; The methodology, once demonstrated,&nbsp;could be spread through the National Center for Hearing Assessment and Management (NCHAM), the national technical resource center for the newborn hearing screening and intervention program.&nbsp; NCHAM has a regional network of (pediatric) audiologists throughout the United States who provide technical assistance to the States in implementation of the program.&nbsp; NCHAM also works closely with state program coordinators both individually and collectively.</span></p>

It will not be based upon absolute standards of acceptable performance. If no performance record has been identified, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably and will receive a neutral rating on this factor. Each offeror must provide the past performance information requested or affirmatively state that it possesses no past performance record.<br />B. Management and Staffing<br />The NCPC will evaluate the offeror on its staffing and management approach to determine the degree to which the offeror's approach is best able to meet or exceed the requirements outlined in this SOW. <br />&#61607; Staffing: Significant ranking will be attributed to the offeror's staffing plan; the qualifications of each proposed worker and how each will perform the tasks of this SOW and meet the unique requirements of this small federal agency.<br />&#61607; Management: The offeror will be evaluated on the description of the responsibilities and authorities for operation and management of this contract and all functional activities. <br />C. Price<br />Price reasonableness will be determined through price analysis in accordance with FAR 15.402. The NCPC will utilize a comparison of proposed prices received in response to the solicitation. The proposed price between offers with substantially equal technical and past performance ratings will be a major factor in the selection of a proposal for award. The total cost of this contract shall not exceed $80,000.</p>

The Government currently anticipates awarding multiple contracts to large and small businesses.  Contracts may be awarded on a regional basis to support small business asappropriate.  It is anticipated that a majority of the task orders will be awarded fixed price and thus require payment and performance bonding.  All sub-categories of small businesses are being considered during our market research phase. Based upon approval, it is projected that each contract awarded will have a basic ordering period of two (2) years with one additional option period of three (3) years, for a total of five (5) years of performance. Contractors are required to be registered in Central Contract Registration (CCR) will be mandatory for receiving an award of any of these contracts (see CCR website at www.ccr.gov).<BR><BR>Multiple Geographic Regional contracts are being considered, they include the following states as follows:<BR><BR>1.

<DESC><p>Gain knowledge of the future procurement business practices of our United States Air Force at the CONUS Installation level. The need has been identified for a fundamental shift in the contracting and acquisition processes conducted in support of Air Force installations. Central to this transformation is the introduction of five geographic-based Regional Centers (RCs). The majority of installation contracting will be accomplished at these five RCs utilizing strategic sourcing principles. This should provide uniform acquisition guidance and oversight resulting in considerable annual savings to the Air Force. Wright-Patterson Air Force Base is expected to begin implementation (transitioning workload to the Hampton Roads VA Regional Center) approximately October 2009.
<p>An invitation is extended to Industry operating in Ohio to learn more about Installation Acquisition Transformation (IAT) and specifically how it might affect your business association with Wright-Patterson AFB and the Air Force. Industry partners are encouraged to attend a briefing and ask questions during the forum on 7 May 2008 from 1:00 PM - 3:30 PM at Building 640, AFIT Bane Auditorium on Wright Patterson AFB, Ohio.</p>

<DESC><p>Gain knowledge of the future procurement business practices of our United States Air Force at the CONUS Installation level. The need has been identified for a fundamental shift in the contracting and acquisition processes conducted in support of Air Force installations. Central to this transformation is the introduction of five geographic-based Regional Centers (RCs). The majority of installation contracting will be accomplished at these five RCs utilizing strategic sourcing principles. This should provide uniform acquisition guidance and oversight resulting in considerable annual savings to the Air Force. Wright-Patterson Air Force Base is expected to begin implementation (transitioning workload to the Hampton Roads VA Regional Center) approximately October 2009.
<p>An invitation is extended to Industry operating in Ohio to learn more about Installation Acquisition Transformation (IAT) and specifically how it might affect your business association with Wright-Patterson AFB and the Air Force. Industry partners are encouraged to attend a briefing and ask questions during the forum on 7 May 2008 from 1:00 PM - 3:30 PM at Building 640, AFIT Bane Auditorium on Wright Patterson AFB, Ohio.</p>
<p>To attend the briefing and gain access to WPAFB, you must:</p>
<p>1. Call 937-522-4530 BEFORE Noon on 30 April 2008 and supply the following information for every individual who wishes to attend:</p>

<DESC><p>Gain knowledge of the future procurement business practices of our United States Air Force at the CONUS Installation level. The need has been identified for a fundamental shift in the contracting and acquisition processes conducted in support of Air Force installations. Central to this transformation is the introduction of five geographic-based Regional Centers (RCs). The majority of installation contracting will be accomplished at these five RCs utilizing strategic sourcing principles. This should provide uniform acquisition guidance and oversight resulting in considerable annual savings to the Air Force. Wright-Patterson Air Force Base is expected to begin implementation (transitioning workload to the Hampton Roads VA Regional Center) approximately October 2009.
<p>An invitation is extended to Industry operating in Ohio to learn more about Installation Acquisition Transformation (IAT) and specifically how it might affect your business association with Wright-Patterson AFB and the Air Force. Industry partners are encouraged to attend a briefing and ask questions during the forum on 7 May 2008 from 1:00 PM - 3:30 PM at Building 640, AFIT Bane Auditorium on Wright Patterson AFB, Ohio.</p>
<p>To attend the briefing and gain access to WPAFB, you must:</p>
<p>1. Call 937-522-4530 BEFORE Noon on 30 April 2008 and supply the following information for every individual who wishes to attend:</p>

<DESC>This announcement is not a request for proposals and there is no solicitation available. The Bureau of Reclamation- Pacific Northwest Region, Boise, Idaho, per the authority of FAR 6.001(a) and using FAR Parts 13 procedures, intends to negotiate a non-competitive contract with RD Schmidt and Associates in Isanti, MN 55040  to provide the modeling expertise needed to develop and apply a basin-wide spatial water allocation model for the Boise Valley. Reclamation, the University of Idaho (U of I), and the Idaho Water Resources Research Institute (IWRRI) are collaborating on a study entitled, "Spatial Water Allocation Modeling to evaluate the Cost/Benefit of Conservation Measures for meeting Boise River Flow Augmentation Targets".The primary objective of this study is to provide Reclamation water managers with a modeling tool which will enable them to evaluate both the hydrologic and economic outcomes of various water management alternatives being considered for the Boise Valley, including alternatives for meeting Boise River flow augmentation targets.
RD Schmidt (formerly a Reclamation employee) is a groundwater hydrologist doing research in the area of integrated hydrologic and economic modeling.  While working for Reclamation, RD Schmidt and U of I economist Leroy Stodick developed procedures by which a hydrologic model could be mathematically coupled to a partial equilibrium economic model.  The unique mathematical expressions were then used to convert hydrologic model outputs into economic model inputs (i.e. water supply-cost relationships) for canal diverters, groundwater pumpers, and drain water users in a prototype spatial water allocation model for the Boise Valley.  
This modeling work has not been duplicated elsewhere, and the mathematical expressions developed by RD Schmidt and Leroy Stodick are not standard knowledge for hydrologists or economists working in the field.  RD Schmidt's and Leroy Stodick's research experience in coupling hydrologic and economic models and their unique knowledge of the software used for hydrologic and economic modeling (MODFLOW, GFLOW and GAMS) will be essential for successful development of a basin-wide spatial water allocation model for the Boise Valley. Utilizing a different groundwater specialist and economist would require those specialists to replicate the research accomplished under Reclamation's Boise Valley Water Use Study.  
This acquisition is classified under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541690 Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services. The size standard as defined by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) for this NAICS code is $6.5 M.

<RESPDATE>043008
<CONTACT>Chris Glista, Contracting Officer, Email christopher.glista@darpa.mil
<DESC>INDUSTRY DAY CONFERENCE: 
DARPA/TTO will host a classified (secret-level) industry day conference in support of the Joint DARPA/ONR Long Range Anti-Ship Missile Demonstration (LR-ASM) program (BAA 08-41) on May 6, 2008 at Schafer Corporation, 3811 N. Fairfax Drive, Suite 400, Arlington, Virginia, 22203 from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m..  Registration begins at 8:00 a.m. and the conference will start promptly at 9:00 a.m.  The purpose of this conference is to provide information on the LR-ASM program; promote additional discussion on this topic; address questions from potential proposers; and provide a forum for potential proposers to meet to discuss teaming opportunities.  Any questions related to this announcement should be sent to BAA08-41@darpa.mil.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION:
The Long Range Anti-Ship Missile Demonstration program is a joint DARPA/ONR effort to rapidly develop and demonstrate a ship launched standoff anti-ship strike weapon capable of achieving mission kill against selective surface targets at significant standoff ranges.  The program will develop technologies that enable U.S. surface platforms to engage other surface units from well outside counter-fire ranges, with inherent capability to ensure weapon survivability against advanced defensive systems.  The program should achieve robust integrated flight test of a prototype system no later than three years after contract award.  Proposers will be encouraged to provide best performance solutions based on innovative application of technologies that can realistically achieve flight status within this timeframe.  Consideration should be given to innovative terminal survivability and lethality approaches that are effective against current and projected ship defensive systems.

The Government envisions a two phase development program.  Phase 1 will fully develop system concepts, generate preliminary system designs, estimate procurement and lifecycle costs, and support government analytical evaluation of design effectiveness.  This phase, approximately nine (9) months in duration, will culminate in a preliminary design review (PDR) and independent technical assessment.  Phase 2 will progress through detail design, component maturation and testing, system integration including subsystem verification testing, flight test planning, long lead procurement, and a critical design review (CDR).  Upon successful completion of a CDR, Phase 2 will continue with final system fabrication, integration, and testing as required to achieve a full-scale flight test and integrated demonstration of kinematic performance, guidance, target discrimination and acquisition, terminal survivability techniques, and warhead lethality.  It is strongly desired that the full effort, including the integrated demonstration, be completed within thirty-six (36) months from contract award.

REGISTRATION INFORMATION: 
Participants must register no later than April 30, 2008 at the following website: www.schafertmd.com/conference/LRASM.  Directions to the facility and other materials are also available on the website.  There is no registration fee for attending this conference.  If space limitations are approached, organizations may be asked to limit attendance.

The May 6th industry day conference will be classified at the DoD secret level.  Visitors must check in at Schafer reception in Suite 400.  Visitors will not be admitted without proper photo identification and a current visit request on file.  Please see the security link on the registration website for details.

The latter portion of the industry day will be set aside to allow attendees to present company overviews, discuss their technology expertise, and discuss teaming opportunities with the industry audience.  Upon arrival, the attendees will receive their scheduled time for presenting.  The opportunity to present will be afforded on a first come, first served basis.  It is the presenter’s responsibility to ensure that all proposed material, whether unclassified, classified, or otherwise sensitive, is reviewed prior to being displayed at the conference by the organization that funded the effort.  Presentations will be limited to ten (10) minutes each.

Proposers desiring to present at the industry day conference should send an electronic copy of all unclassified material to be presented to BAA08-41@darpa.mil as soon as possible, but no later than May 2, 2008.  Submissions should identify which functional area is applicable to their presentation (e.g. seeker, guidance, warhead, propulsion, system integration, etc.).  In the case of classified presentations, material handling details are outlined on the registration website under the security link.

<DESC><p>This is a Request for Information for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.
<p>The Training and Information Services Division (TISD), Federal Student Aid, U.S. Department of Education conducts training and outreach activities at Federal Student Aid's ten Regional Training Facilities, at various off-site locations, and in a variety of on-line formats, including asynchronous self-paced training. To ensure that all training efforts are appropriately evaluated by attendees and participants of the training, we currently collect a combination of paper forms and on-line surveys that are approved by the Office of Management and Budget. These surveys are manually collated and analyzed at a high labor cost. This manual collection also creates the possibility of data entry error, loss of paper documents in transit, and calculation errors.</p>
<p>Therefore, TISD is in search of a solution that can collect evaluation data from both on-line and machine-scannable training evaluation forms, automate the data entry process, including the collection of text comments, and integrate the data electronically so that it can be organized, analyzed, and reports generated.</p>
<p>We would also like the capability to port data into standard spreadsheet formats from other sources including on-line survey vendors, such as Zoomerang or Surveymonkey.</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to submit information on product capabilities. An estimate for planning purposes only of the number of training course evaluations and surveys collected annually is approximately 25,000 to 30,000.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) has a sole source requirement to continue support of the Airborne Equipment Demonstration Support for Science and Technology (S&T) sensor development programs at NAVAIR PMA264 under Contract N00421-08-C-0001 with Aviation Systems Engineering Company Inc. (ASEC), Lexington Park, MD in accordance with the statutory authority permitting other than Full and Open Competition in 10 USC 2304 (c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Due to unforeseen delays in obtaining the required approvals and resultant certifications, there is a projected gap in support.  Prior to the award of a new competitive contract, an additional 100 flight hours will be added to cover this projected gap.  Procuring Airborne Demonstration Support from an alternate source would cause the Government to incur substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency’s requirements.   For these reasons, only ASEC’s Airborne Equipment Demonstration support is capable of fulfilling the Government’s requirements.  The associated NAICS code for this procurement is 481219 with a dollar standard of $6.5M.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and submit technical information and a technical capability statement in response to this notice. Responses without a return address, mailing address, and company telephone number will not be recognized. No phone calls will be accepted. Proprietary data in the responses will be protected where so designated. Offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to be eligible for contract award or payment from any DOD activity. A determination not to compete this proposed extension based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All inquiries should be directed to the Contract Specialist, Blake Strickland, via e-mail blake.strickland@navy.mil.  Numbered Note 22 Applies.

The ISA provides the opportunities for attendees to hear world renowned experts and interact one-on-one with industry professionals.  Over the last three years, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, in conjunction with the Heart of America Joint Terrorism Task Force, has initiated the ISA twice. The inaugural ISA was held May 2-5, 2005 in Kansas City, Missouri.  The conference brought together more than 800 individuals from all 50 states and eight countries.  The second ISA, held September 25-29, 2006, built upon the success of the inaugural event, assembling nearly 1000 attendees from 21 countries.  DHS intends to participate in the ISA scheduled for 2008.  Through its participation DHS will engage in outreach activities with the health, medical and veterinary professions and private industry, and be able to identify significant issues relevant to terrorism incidents/threats involving food and agricultural sectors.  No other forum is known to exist which provides comparable opportunities to engage in similar outreach activities.

No solicitation document exists and requests for such will not be considered.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.

<DESC>Under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c) (1); implemented by FAR 6.302 1, the U.S. Army RDECOM Acquisition Center, Natick Contracting Division, Natick, MA intends to award a modification increasing the overall contract ceiling for contract M67004-04-D-0039 to EAI of Abingdon MD.  EAI as the incumbent is the only contractor with the expertise and operational knowledge that can continue this vital support while the solicitation process is prepared for the full and open competition of the follow on contract.  It is unrealistic to expect other offerors to have the fully developed skills necessary to step into this situation and provide immediate, seamless support.  The complexities of the effort, coupled with the need to ensure uninterrupted services, make it impractical to seek anyone other than the incumbent for such a short period of time.  The knowledge and experience necessary for full and successful contract performance is such that a contractor other than the incumbent would need more than six months to assume the full level of support essential to ongoing operations.   To incur such a delay now would create unnecessary risks, both to the mission of the war effort and to those pursuing it.<BR><BR>It is anticipated that the ceiling increase of will allowfor continued contract performance until award of the new contract in December 2008.  <BR><BR>Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.

Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).

(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the USAF Academy Ombudsmen,

AFFARS 5352.223-9001, Health and Safety on Government Installations.

AFFARS 5352.242-9500, Contractor Access to Air Force Installations

(a) Security Requirements.  The Contractor shall adhere to the installation security requirements as provided for in AFI 31-601, Industrial Security Program Management, and the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) Supplement to AFI 31-601. When work under this contract requires unescorted entry to controlled or restricted areas, the Contractor shall comply with AFI 31-101, Volume 1, The Air Force Installation Security Program, and AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management, as applicable.

(b) The Contractor shall submit a letter to the Contracting Officer specifying the personnel authorized to sign a USAFA Form O-111 requesting a Contractor Identification Badge or vehicle pass. The Contractor shall submit a USAFA Form O-111 on each employee requiring access to an installation. [The Contracting Officer or Sponsoring Official will endorse the request and forward a copy to the issuing base pass and registration office or security forces for processing. The individual requiring the badge will hand-carry the original Form O-111 to the issuing base pass and registration office or Security Forces for processing.]  When reporting to the registration office to obtain a vehicle pass, the authorized Contractor individual(s) should also provide a valid driver's license, current vehicle registration, valid vehicle insurance certificate, and any documents required by local Security Forces procedures.

(c) In lieu of USAFA Form O-111, Application For Personnel And Vehicle Passes To Work Under Air Force Contract, or a temporary AF FM 75, Visitor Pass, the Contractor shall obtain Contractor Identification Badges and/or vehicle passes for all Contractor personnel who make frequent visits (i.e., more than 7 visits per calendar year) to perform work on the Air Force installation(s) cited in the contract. Contractor personnel are required to prominently display their Contractor Identification Badges in a visible location above their waist while visiting or performing work on the installation. The Contracting Office may restrict the Contractor’s employees from accessing the installation(s) until Contractor Identification Badges and vehicle passes are obtained.

(d) During performance of the contract, the Contractor shall be responsible for obtaining required identification for newly assigned personnel and for prompt return of credentials and vehicle passes for any employee who no longer requires access to the work site. Credentials and vehicle passes shall be returned to the issuing office within 5 calendar days after the employee no longer requires access to the work site.

(e) Background Checks.  All employees of the Contractor shall comply with USAFA security requirements while on the installation.  Prior to Contractor personnel working on USAFA installation properties, the Contractor and all Contractor personnel shall agree to USAFA conducting a criminal background check. USAFA Security Forces shall conduct the criminal background check accessing the appropriate state crime information center and national crime information center database to include, but not limited to any state listed by the employee as current and past addresses.  
 
(f) Convictions.  Based on the results of the background check, any felony conviction in the past ten (10) years involving violence, weapons, explosives, physical assault, espionage, illegal drugs, theft or any violations of immigration and naturalization laws shall constitute indisputable grounds for the Contracting Officer, with coordination from the 10th Air Base Wing Commander, to immediately require removal of the employee from the effort under this contract.  For convictions more than ten (10) years ago, the Contractor may recommend retaining the employee.  Any misdemeanor conviction in the past five (5) years involving the same offenses as stated above shall constitute indisputable grounds, with coordination from the 10th Air Base Wing Commander, to immediately remove the employee from effort under this contract.  Employees removed by the Contracting Officer may also be subject to barment from entering the USAFA.  The Contractor may appeal the barment through the 10th Security Forces Squadron Commander to the 10th Air Base Wing Commander who may rescind the barment and permit the contractor employee to work on the installation. The Contracting Officer shall be immediately notified of all such cases, and the Contracting Officer may require the Contractor to restrict the employee’s use on this contract until the case is resolved.  This action does not relieve the Contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.

(g) Warrants.  If during the course of Contractor Identification Badge processing, any Contractor personnel are found to have an outstanding warrant, Security Forces may detain the contractor employee and may notify the appropriate law enforcement authorities. The 10th Air Base Wing Commander may issue a barment letter based upon the gravity of the offenses surrounding the warrant. However, the Contractor may appeal the barment through the 10th Security Forces Squadron Commander to the 10th Air Base Wing Commander who may rescind the barment and permit the contractor employee to work on the installation. The Contracting Officer shall be immediately notified by the prime contractor of all such cases, and the Contracting Officer may require the Contractor to restrict the employee’s use on this contract until the case is resolved.

(h) Prior to use of an employee on this contract, the Contractor shall validate that the employee is a United States citizen or holds a valid resident alien status. If the employee is not a United States citizen, the Contractor shall validate the individual’s proof of alien registration with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Service. The Contractor will cooperate in the Security Forces’ processing of its employees for Contractor Identification Badges for access to the USAFA under this contract. 

(i) If this contract requires that any of the Contractor's personnel must submit to a National Agency Check (NAC) background check, the Government shall bear the expense of that background check.  In that event, the Contractor agrees to fully cooperate in the processing of the NAC background check.  Those employees shall also be subject to the background check required for issuing a Contractor Identification Badge, as described above.

(j) Removal of Contractor Employees.  The Government reserves the right to direct the removal of an employee for substantiated misconduct (has the potential to jeopardize the mission, put themselves or others at risk, etc.) or security reasons.  This action does not relieve the Contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.

(k) Upon completion or termination of the contract or expiration of the Contractor Access Identification, the prime Contractor shall ensure that all Contractor Identification Badges and vehicle passes issued to employees and subcontractor employees are returned to the issuing office within 21 calendar days.

(l) Failure to comply with these requirements may result in withholding of payment.

(m) All references to Contractor above include the Contractor and Subcontractors.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Far Subpart 12.6, streamlined procedures for evaluation and solicitation for commercial items, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a written solicitation document will not be issued. This solicitation is being issued using simplified acquisition procedures. This solicitation is a request for quotation (RFQ). The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 811219.

Food and Drug Administration intends to award a competitive purchase order for a positioning track system. The system is needed for is Food and Drug Administration/Center for Devices and Radiological Health/ Office of Science and Engineering Laboratories/ Ionizing Radiation Measurements Laboratory (FDA/CDRH/OSEL/IRML).


A) General Description: A positioning track system is needed for a 320 kV X-ray unit that is used for calibrating radiation monitors for the FDA NVLAP accredited X-ray Calibration Laboratory. 

B) General Requirements 

The following Computer Control System and Hardware is needed to interface with an existing FDA 320 kVp Diagnostic X-ray System: 
	1) Positioning System: (controlled by Computer control system) 
Computer Controlled 3 Axis positioning system used to position a 0.9 x 0.5 meter platform with an accuracy of &#8804; ± 1 mm with a platform load of 100kg. The platform will hold ion chambers, phantoms, or survey meters to insure optimal centering and variability for setup in useful x-ray beam. 
	• X-Axis: ~9 meters long and parallel to X-Ray beam through out the full length  of  travel. 
	(The X-Axis must allow personnel easy access and maneuverability around the track for moving around the room) 
	• Y-Axis: 90 cm meter travel, horizontal and perpendicular to X-Ray beam 
	• Z-Axis: ~30cm travel, vertical and perpendicular to the X-Ray beam 
	2) Collimator (aperture) positioning and Filter positioning systems: 
(Controlled by Computer control system) 

The Collimator and Filter positioning systems are separate components, but because they both need to be located to insure good beam geometry they are listed together. The Collimator positioning system needs to be located to insure good beam geometry for the filter positioning system, the transmission monitor, and the survey meter or ion chamber. The beam must be collimated enough so that it does not interact with the Filter positioning holder by only hitting the filter material pack. The Vendor can manufacture the Collimator and Filter positioning system as a unit, but they must work independently. Components for the control system include, but may not necessarily be limited to the following: 
 
• Computer control Collimator positioning system that position ~6 separate lead collimators with apertures diameters of 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1cm. 
Must be easy for FDA personnel to install different apertures, or an alternative that will allow flexibility of optimizing good beam geometry for 
• Computer controlled Filter positioning system that positions ~10 separate filters, and allows easily switching of groups of filters. 
Vender will need to modify FDA’s existing 100 mm square filters to fit in vendor provided filter positioning system. A filter shelf will also be needed for mounting additional filters 
• Bracket that will allow (FDA provided) transmission monitor to be mounted after the beam has exited the filter. 
3) Laser alignment system that defines the following: 
	a) the source to probe distance for a point that is defined at the center of the platform cart 
	b) additional variable distance laser that defines a point up to 5 cm in front of the platform cart 
	c) reference center of x-ray beam both vertically and horizontally 
	4) Computer control system: 

The control system is focused in the following areas: 
	• Equipment communication and positioning set up 
	• Ion chamber calibration 
	• Exposure rate calculation 
	• kVp, mA, and exposure time control 
	• Reading of the electrometer 
	• Statistical quality control monitoring so that limits of variability for selected or historical parameters are not exceeded 
	• Automated calibration report generation for individual test instruments 
Vendor shall adapt their control system software to FDA’s existing techniques and procedures. FDA has ownership and all rights to access and modify any source code that controls the X-Ray calibration system. Adequate documentation will be provided to verify that all requirements are met. The final product will meet ADA requirements. The control system program must be modular in design, allowing for easy modifications to the system. 

C) Detailed Description 

1) Positioning System 
The 320KV X-Ray beam centerline is 1.65 meter above and parallel to the floor. The Positioning System shall facilitate mounting and positioning instruments and phantoms in a stable, repeatable (±1mm) fashion in the center of the X-Ray beam. The system must be level and sturdy for the entire travel length, to insure positioning reproducibility for all axes. The positioning system needs to hold 100kg without significant deflection and have a minimum of backlash and side-play. The mounting platform needs to be a flat 
 
plate with an alignment grid engraved (1 cm grid). Mounting holes that are ¼”-20 SAE drilled and tapped in the plate in 10 cm intervals (starting 5 cm from the platforms edge) to allow jigs to be bolted to the platform. Platform size needs to be approximately ~ 90 cm x 50 cm. The Platform will need to support the 100kg without deflection. The positioning track shall be configured as a three axis system with a positioning accuracy of ± 1 mm designed primarily for positioning ion chambers for calibration. Each axis shall be operated via computer control from the control console and jog switches on the Positioning System (jog switches will be located on the right side of the Y-Axis assembly). (Note: The right side is from the perspective of the 320 kV X-Ray tube). Each axis will include a metric scale with an applicable axis pointer to manually confirm positioning. The X-Axis scale will need to be referenced to the Focal Spot of the X-Ray tube. 
Because the Positioning Track System will move up to 8.5 meters (X-Axis) and 0.9 meter (Y-Axis), a method for controlling the cables (data/control/signal/power) will be required. The cable management system must allow FDA personnel to easily add and/or remove cables as needed. 
Note: Not required but would be nice: the use of Absolute Encoders in the positioning circuit, so the positioning system would not have to seek a home (reference) switch with the loss of power. 
	• X-Axis: 

The X-Axis needs to allow the travel of the Y-Axis up to 8.5 meters away from the X-Ray source. Because the X-Axis travel utilizes most of the length of the room, the design must allowing easy personnel maneuverability. One Example that would work is tracks/rail that is mounted close to the floor (&#8804;15cm). The system must be level, sturdy, and centered to the useful beam for the entire length of travel, to insure positioning reproducibility and good beam geometry without having to readjust the y or z axis and by only changing collimation. The system will need to be aligned to keep the platform precisely leveled with the beam centerline. Overall track/rail length will be 9 meters; allowing 8.5 meters of Y-Axis (platform) positioning travel. This also allows space for the x-ray cabinet at one end. The Y-axis moves along the X-axis and is controlled via computer control from the control console and jog switches located on the right side of the Y-Axis frame. The X-Axis positioning accuracy needs to be &#8804; ± 1 mm (referenced from the X-Ray tube focal Spot). 
	• Y-Axis: 

The Y-Axis is a framework that moves on the X-Axis and is designed to places the Y-axis system (track/rails) approximately 40cm under the beam centerline. The Z-Axis platform is mounted to the Y-Axis system (tracks/rails). The Y-axis is ~2m long. The platform size shall be 0.9 m x 0.5 m. The Y-axis travel must provide adequate travel so that any part of the (Z-Axis) 0.9 m wide platform can be placed in the beam centerline. The bottom of the Y-Axis framework will have a shelf with minimum of 30cm vertical clearance. Located near the shelf will be 115 VAC 60 Hz 15A outlet or power strip connected to building power/outlet. The right side of the Y-Axis framework will include 
 
a method for mounting alignment Laser(s) to position the laser light horizontal and perpendicular to the X-Ray beam center line (~1.65 meters from the floor). 
(Note: The right side is from the perspective of the 320 kV X-Ray tube). The lasers will need to be able to be positioned up to 5cm in front of the platform and mark the full 40cm depth of the platform. The Y-Axis movement is controlled via computer control from the control console and jog switch located on the right side of the Y-Axis frame. The Y-Axis positioning accuracy needs to be &#8804; ± 1 mm to accurately indicate the distance from the referenced X-Ray source to the reference spot on the platform). 
	• Z-Axis: 

The Z-Axis moves on the Y-Axis rails and is positioned so that with the Z-Axis fully raised, will position the Platform 10cm below the X-Ray beam center line. With the Z-Axis fully lowered, it will position the Platform 40cm below the X-Ray beam center line. The vertical axis provides 30 cm of vertical movement for the Platform. 
Z-axis is controlled via computer control from the control console and jog switch located on the right side of the Y-Axis frame. 
The Z-Axis positioning accuracy needs to be &#8804; ± 1 mm (referenced to the X-Ray beam horizontal center line) 
2) Collimator (aperture) positioning and Filter positioning systems: 
(Controlled by Computer control system) 
Collimator (aperture) positioning system: 
The Collimator (Aperture) assembly must be designed to modify the beam diameter of the X-ray beam to provide good beam geometry for the various beam configurations required for calibrating and testing ion chambers, radiation monitors, survey meters, and phantoms. The computer controlled collimator positioning system positions ~6 separate lead collimators for energies up to 300 kV with apertures diameters of 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1cm with a minimum positioning accuracy of ±1 mm. Individual apertures must be easy for FDA personnel to replace with different apertures. 
Filter positioning system: 
The filer is used to modify the spectral characteristics of the X-ray beam to meet the various beam codes required for calibrating instruments. The Computer controlled Filter positioning system positions the approximate center of the filter material in the center of the X-Ray beam. Filter thickness ranging from 0.1mm to 15mm in thickness. We are looking for a system that will position at least 10 filters and will allow easy switching of all ten 10 filters. Example: disk with 10 filter, remove current disk and insert separate disk with 10 different filters. 
Vender will need to modify FDA’s existing 100 mm square filters to fit in vendor provided filter positioning system. 
Note: After a filter is positioned, only the filter material shall be in the X-Ray beam path. None of the positioning system or material used to secure the filter material can be in the X-Ray beam path. (~7 cm diameter clearance is required) 
 
3) Laser alignment system: (self leveling) 
Allows technicians to determine the following: 
	• Fixed Cross hair laser, assist technician to position instrument on the platform 
	• Movable Cross hair laser that defines a point up to 5 cm in front of the platform 
	• Two line lasers that form a cross hair down the center of the X-Ray beam path. 
(Located on or near the filter positioning system) 
1st line laser to the side of X-Ray beam, mounted so the laser line is horizontal and down the center of the X-Ray beam path, this will indicate the X-Ray beams vertical center (~1.65 meters) 
2nd line laser above or below the X-Ray beam, mounted so the laser line is vertical and down the center of the X-Ray beam path, this will indicate the X-Ray beams horizontal center 

4) Description of Control System 
The vendor shall provide a rack mounted state of the art computer with necessary software and hardware to run the control system and program. Vendor shall interface their software to FDA’s existing techniques and procedures. The control software is powerful yet designed to be simple to use. The core program shall be a PC Windows-based program. It shall be very easy for an operator to use on a routine basis. Only information for routine use shall be presented to the operator, but easily available to the operator upon demand. Selection of options shall be clear and unambiguous. Status of all system components shall be shown in a concise display. The control software shall be designed on a modular approach for functions. The program shall have the ability to generate and print customer calibration reports on demand for calibrated test instrument with logo and letterhead, customer information and identification, and selected parameters relevant to each calibration point.

<CONTACT>Kathleen D Allen, Phone 314-676-0198, Email kathleen.d.allen@nga.mil
<DESC>The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) intends to award a sole source firm fixed price contract to Avenza Systems, Inc. This combined synopsis/solicitation is posted with the intent of awarding to Avenza Systems, Inc., 124 Merton Street, Suite 400, Toronto, Ontario, M4S272 (Canada). These items are the sole proprietary product of the vendor and no other authorized resellers are anticipated. The requirement is for the following Avenza items:

CLIN0001: P/N – MAPublisher Floating Licenses version upgrade from LT Version to Version 7.3. (Qty = 150 each)  Period of Performance:  04/01/2008 through 03/31/2009
 
BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION: MAPublisher is a proprietary software application made by Avenza Systems, Inc. Selection of a different product would not be compatible with our customers needs as this software is used to support the essential functionality of the product that enables Adobe Illustrator in use by the Analytic Production Operations to natively read the data from ESRI ArcGIS used by NGA Analysts.  Due to the fact that this software is already integrated into the NGA enterprise it would be extremely costly for the Agency to switch to a new type of software. A switch at this juncture would cause personnel to have to be trained to use new software and NGA would suffer unacceptable production delays due to the implementation of any new software.

Delivery is FOB Destination to NGA – Washington Navy Yard, Attn: Covert Beach/PZIE, 1200 First Street, MS: N-024, Washington, DC 20303-0001 in the quantities listed above.

Scott Rogers			Contract Specialist, 10 MSG/LGCA
Dr. Brian Mihlbachler		Biologist, NFWS, 10CES/CECN

Christine Alexander		Vegetation Management
Duane Lindmeir		Vegetation Management
Mark Wright			Horizon Lawn and Tree Care
Pat Casey			TP Enterprises
Terry Pickrell			TP Enterprises
Michael Finlay		Open Range Weed Control
Dan Carlisle			Firm Vegetation Management

The following items where discussed during this Conference;

1.	The conference began at 0805 in Conference Room A of Building 8110 and was opened by Scott Rogers. He welcomed the participants and reminded them that nothing in the Conference would qualify the terms and conditions of the solicitation and specifications and that the terms of the solicitation and specifications remain unchanged unless the solicitation is amended in writing.   He then introduced Dr. Brian Mihlbachler.

2.	Dr. Mihlbachler gave a short briefing that included the background of noxious weeds spraying efforts at the USAF Academy (USAFA), a short technical discussion of the types of noxious weeds and their location using the aerial map, the location of no-spray areas due to Prebble’s mouse habitats, external access points to USAFA and to points within USAFA, the location of training areas and secure areas, and identified the pest management coordinator.

3.	The following questions were submitted:

a.	Do you have to exit USAFA to mix herbicides? Yes. The contractor can mix a large tank offsite and fill into smaller tanks within USAFA.
b.	Will USAFA provide a water supply? No.
c.	Will USAFA send an inspector as an escort with the contractor? No, USAFA will conduct spot checks.
d.	Will USAFA provide security escorts? Only in areas that require escorts. The successful Offeror will submit a list of employees that will, upon clearance through a local police check, be issued a badge authorizing them access to the majority of USAFA.
e.	Will USAFA treat 50 Russian Olives every year? No. Russian Olives will be identified on a case by case basis. There may not be any in the years after the base year. There are some near I-25 that are the responsibility of CDOT. The contractor will treat trees more than 50 feet from the road. The contractor may also treat some resprouts.
f.	What types of vehicles are allowed off-road? Most areas are accessible to 4-wheel drive motor vehicles and ATV’s. In a few areas a long hose layout or a backpack may be required.
g.	Are the 350 areas to be covered “treated” or “covered” acres? Treated acres. This will be based on budget, the wheather, and when the limit for active ingredients has been met.
h.	Is pricing data available from the previous contract? No.
i.	How many applications are required in the summer? Due to the continuous nature of the maturing of weeds applications are made on an almost continuous basis during the growing season.

4.	A tour of USAFA rangelands was conducted from 0835 to1035. Along the east boundary Dr. Mihlbachler pointed out areas with Prebble’s Mouse habitat. Near the northwest corner of USAFA Dr. Mihlbachler showed all participants an area where there a group of rare plants (Rocky Mountain Cinquefoil). Near the entrance to Jacks Valley Dr. Mihlbachler pointed out that Buffalo Berry trees (Cherperdis) have been mistaken for Russian Olive and that care needs to be taken to properly identify Russian Olives. The Conference concluded upon return to Building 8110.

5.	If the question you asked at the site visit is not present or properly represented here please contact Scott Rogers, 719-333-6368,  or submit it by e-mail and it will be corrected, answered, and posted.

<DESC>Question 1)  Is there any GPS units that are comparable to the Javad Maxor?

Answer:  Yes, here are some units that are comparable:
                Topcon HiperLite+
                Trimble R8 GNSS
                Javad Triumph--1-G3T

Question 2)  Why do you want a GPS unit which is equivalent to the Javad Maxor GGD?

Answer:  Past performance of previously owned Javad Maxor GPS units met our expections.  
                We want to make sure that whatever we purchase will provide equal or 
                better performance.

Question 3)  Where are these GPS units going to be used and what will the be used for?

Answer:  We will be using these units primarily to establish precise coordinates for forest 
                inventory plots distributed throughout coastal and possibly interior Alaska, so it is 
                very important that these units have the capability to provide accurate, and
                precise positions even under dense forest canopy.

Question 4)  Which type of GPS receiver (satellite or other types) will you require?

Answer:  These are GPS+GLONASS systems and are satellite-based.

Normal color variations, form joint marks, small surface holes caused by air bubbles, and minor chips and spalls will be accepted but no major imperfections, honeycombs or other major defects will be permitted.<BR><BR>6.2.5   Stripping Products from Forms<BR><BR>Do not remove products from the forms until the concrete reaches the compressive strength for stripping required by the design.  If no such requirement exists, products may be removed from the forms after the final set of concrete provided that stripping damage is minimal.<BR><BR>6.2.6   Patching and Repair<BR><BR>No repair is required to formed surfaces that are relatively free of air voids and honeycombed areas, unless the surfaces are required by the design to be finished.<BR><BR>6.2.6.1   Repairing Minor Defects<BR><BR>Defects that will not impair the functional use or expected life of a precast concrete product may be repaired by any method that does not impair the product.<BR><BR>6.2.6.2   Repairing Honeycombed Areas<BR><BR>When honeycombed areas are to be repaired, remove all loose material and cut back the areas into essentially horizontal or vertical planes to a depth at which coarse aggregate particles break under chipping rather than being dislodged.  Use proprietary repair materials in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.  If a proprietary repair material is not used, saturate the area with water.  Immediately prior to repair, the area should be damp, but free of excess water.  Apply a cement-sand grout or an approved bonding agent to the chipped surfaces, followed immediately by consolidating an appropriate repair material into the cavity.<BR><BR>6.2.6.3   Repairing Major Defects<BR><BR>Evaluate, by qualified personnel, defects in precast concrete products which impairthe functional use or the expected life of products to determine if repairs are feasible and, if so, to establish the repair procedure.<BR><BR>6.2.7   Shipping Products<BR><BR>Do not ship products until they are at least 5 days old, unless it can be shownthat the concrete strength has reached at least 75% of the specified 28-day strength, or that damage will not result, impairing the performance of the product.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>

<p>NAICS CODE: 541712</p>
<p>FEDERAL AGENCY NAME: Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, AFRL - Rome Research Site, AFRL/Information Directorate, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY, 13441-4514</p>
<p>TITLE: Information Warfare: Offensive and Defensive Counterinformation</p>
<p>ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial announcement.</p>
<p>FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA 06-12-IFKA</p>
<p>CFDA Number: 12.800</p>
<p>DATES: It is recommended white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 06 by 10 Mar 06; FY 07 by 1 May 06; FY 08 by 1 May 07 and, FY 09 by 1 May 08. White papers will be accepted until 2:00 p.m. Eastern time on 31 December 2009, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited. FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME. See Section IV of this announcement for further details.</p>
<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>INFORMATION WARFARE: AFRL/IF is soliciting white papers to identify and develop technologies to enable a distributed information infrastructure that provides all the mechanisms and services required to allow the warfighters to craft their C4I information environments, including ability to establish distributed virtual staffs, to share a common consistent perception of the battlespace, and construct distributed task teams among sensors, shooters, movers, and command posts. These technologies will be applied across the full spectrum of cyber operations, in support of Air Force mission requirements. Specific technologies include, but are not limited to: network protocols, information adaptation, network management, routing technologies, adaptive interfaces, distributed information environments, multimedia services, adaptive security services, global resource management, architectures, computer and network risk assessment/management, vulnerability assessment, assurance techniques, detection of intrusions and misuse, network security, wireless information assurance, assessment of information damage, cyber forensics, recovery of information systems and computer networks to operational levels, and a full spectrum of active response and computer network attack techniques.</p>
<p>Information superiority is an integral part of air and space superiority, an Air Force doctrine. This gives the commander freedom from attack, the freedom to maneuver and the freedom to attack. Information superiority is that degree of information advantage of one force over another that permits the conduct of operations at a given time and place without prohibitive opposition. Information operations are not focused exclusively on information superiority and information operations alone is not sufficient to achieve information superiority. AFRL/IF has developed a responsive R&amp;D technology program to help the US achieve information superiority. The technology research in this BAA will be focused in the following areas of information operations: influence operations, network warfare operations and electronic warfare operations.</p>
<p>Influence Operations: Focused on affecting the perceptions and behaviors of leaders, groups, or entire populations. Influence operations employ capabilities to affect behaviors, protect operations, communicate commander's intent and project accurate information to achieve desired effects across the cognitive domain. These effects should result in differing objectives. The military capabilities of influence operations are psychological operations, military deception, operations security, counterintelligence operations, counterpropoganda operations and public affairs operations.</p>
<p>Network Warfare Operations: The integrated planning, employment, and assessment of military capabilities to achieve desired effects across the interconnected analog and digital network portion of the battle space. Network warfare operations are conducted in the information domain through the combination of hardware, software, data and human interaction. The operational activities of network warfare operations are network attack, network defense and network warfare support.</p>
<p>Electronic Warfare Operations: The integrated planning, employment, and assessment of military capabilities to achieve desired effects across the electromagnetic domain in support operational objectives.</p>
<p>The objective of this BAA is to address highly innovative R&amp;D areas in information operations. Proposed work should address the innovative and strategic thought of the 21st century adversary, and develop new concepts to counter with innovative information-based capabilities. Further, proposed work should address new concepts for continuously analyzing the information battle space to identify US vulnerabilities and adversary weaknesses, and develop new defensive and offensive strategies and capabilities accordingly.</p>
<p>There are critical technical areas of focus under this BAA which are high leverage areas to be worked in order to address the most difficult Air Force requirements, provide the Air Force with the greatest technology push possible, and surface opportunities for contributing to important national security issues such as defending information systems and countering cyber terrorism.</p>
<p>Network Attack: Employment of network-based capabilities to destroy, disrupt, degrade, deny, delay, corrupt or usurp information resident in or transiting through networks. A primary effect is to influence the adversary commander's decisions.</p>
<p>Network Defense: Employment of network-based capabilities to defend friendly information resident in or transiting through networks against adversary efforts to destroy, disrupt, degrade, deny, delay, corrupt or usurp it. Actions include analyzing network activity to determine the appropriate course of action to protect, detect, and react to internal and external threats to Air Force networks.</p>
<p>Network Warfare Support: The collection and production of network related data for immediate decisions involving network warfare operations. Specifically, network warfare support provides profiling, event analysis, open source review, as well as pattern analysis in support of network defense and countermeasure development.</p>
<p>II. AWARD INFORMATION:</p>
<p>Total funding for this BAA is approximately $49.9M. The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 06 - $13M; FY 07 - $13M; FY 08 - $13M; and FY09 - $10.9M. Individual awards will not normally exceed 24 months with dollar amounts ranging between $100,000 and $1,000,000 per year. Awards of efforts as a result of this announcement will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed.</p>

<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government. Criteria 1 through 3 are of equal importance and of greater importance than criteria 4. <br />(1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- Including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology and its evaluation,<br />(2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge,<br />(3) Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and<br />(4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).</p>
<p>No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a TOP SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to TOP SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data. However, proposals may only be submitted at the unclassified or SECRET level. Proposals submitted above this level will not be accepted or considered.</p>
<p>3. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offeror's will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS. Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.</p>
<p>VII. AGENCY CONTACTS:</p>
<p>Questions of a technical nature shall be directed to the technical points of contact, as specified below:</p>
<p>Frances Rose<br />Telephone: (315) 330-2038 <br />Email: Frances.Rose@rl.af.mil</p>
<p>Questions of a contractual/business nature shall be directed to the cognizant contracting officer, as specified below:</p>
<p>Lori Smith<br />Telephone (315) 330-1955<br />Email: Lori.Smith@rl.af.mil</p>
<p>The email must reference the solicitation (BAA) number and title of the acquisition.</p>
<p>In accordance with AFFARS 5315.90, an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition announcement. Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. AFFARS Clause 5352.201-9101 Ombudsman (Aug 2005) will be incorporated into all contracts awarded under this BAA. The AFRL Ombudsman is as follows:</p>
<p>Susan Hunter<br />AFRL/PK<br />1864 Fourth Street, Suite 1<br />Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-7131<br />(937) 255-7754</p>
<p>All responsible organizations may submit a white paper which shall be considered.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this modification to the announcement is to provide clarification regarding the licensed boat operator requirement.
Depending on the state and river/water system being surveyed by boat there are different requirements on the Federal, State, and sometimes even local levels.  For instance a river like the Columbia may require that all boat operators be licensed with the U.S. Coast Guard.  In the State of New Mexico all boat operators are required to have attended and passed a safety class, conducted by the Parks and Recreation Department, on boat operation prior to operating a vessel on waters in New Mexico.  
Each state and river may have different rules and regulations associated with it.  Because there is a chance that the use of boats may be utilized for underwater surveying it is important that whoever is operating the boat understands the rules and regulations at the Federal, state, and local levels that deal with operating a motorized water craft, and that person has complied with applicable, required regulations.  Unlike the registration for pilots, engineers, or photogrammetrists, a licensed boat operator may consist of just an experienced boat operator if the state and river they are working in has no requirements for certification.
There is no change to the due date of the SF-330s.

<p>The purpose of this modification is to revise the original proposal due date from the May 05, 2008 to May 12, 2008, at 3:00 PM Eastern Time.</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has a requirement for a Performance and Safety Investigation of Emergency Backup Batteries and Battery Charging Systems for Underground Mining Applications.During an underground coal mine emergency, electrical utility power to underground workings may be disrupted by physical damage due to roof falls or explosions, or due to regulatory requirements to turn off power under circumstances such as high methane levels or ventilation interruption. The MINER Act however, requires that mine-wide communications systems vital to the escape, survival, and rescue of workers, must continue to operate in a post-accident environment. Other vital systems such as atmospheric monitoring systems and personnel tracking systems should also continue to provide information vital to informed emergency-conditions decision making. Central to fulfilling the MINER Act requirement to provide continuous emergency mine communications (and other systems), even with a loss of mine electrical power, is the issue of battery backup power. Communications systems components should be hardened to survive the initial event and will be designed to provide readily available two way communications between trapped workers and rescue personnel. Battery power for person-carried radios, leaky feeder system fixed components, fixed wireless mesh nodes, fixed tracking system waypoints, etc. must allow sufficient time for rescue, and be supplied in a manner appropriate for the potentially explosive mine atmosphere. In order to meet the above requirements, existing and potential problems with primary and backup batteries, as well as battery charging systems, must be addressed. Background information and guidance crucial to developing strategies and concepts for effective, safe use of battery power in underground mines will come from a variety of sources, including NIOSH, MSHA, state agencies, mine operators, rescue team personnel, equipment and battery manufacturers, and companies developing new communication and personnel tracking systems in response to the MINER Act. Extensive interaction with NIOSH contractors working on communications and tracking systems is anticipated. This project shall investigate critical aspects of battery selection, use, and charging for the underground coal mining environment, specifically as they relate to communications with, evacuation of, and, if needed, rescue of miners in the event of an emergency. It will ultimately conceptualize potential solutions for primary and/or backup battery systems that offer hazardous area safety (i.e. use in explosive atmospheres), survivability, adequate post-accident operating time, and are practical as well as cost effective. References: Information on NIOSH activities in response to the MINER Act, including complete and ongoing contract work to advance underground mine communications and personnel tracking technology, can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/mining/mineract/mineract.htm This requirement is being solicited on an unrestricted basis as full and open competition. The CDC expects a single award fixed price contract with a period of performance of eleven (11) months. The complete solicitation document, and reference material, if applicable, will be available for downloading at www.fedbizops.gov on or about April 4, 2008 and proposals will be due on or about May 5, 2008. No verbal or written requests for copies will be accepted. It is the responsibility of perspective offerors to stay abreast of additional postings regarding this solicitation at the FedBizOps internet site.</p>

<DESC>Pull floor covering from soft area.  Remove/cut out spongy decking.  Determine and correct the cause of the problem.  Inspect floor joist for saturation and damage.  Flooring, under lament and plywood decking should be replaced throughout the second floor corridor and that intermediate 2 x 4 wood joists should be installed, resulting in joists at eight (8) inches on center.  New plywood decking, 2 x 4  wood joists, carpet  and resilient base should be provided.  There are 26 door openings requiring new threshold / transition strips.
The corridor is approximately 225 feet long by approximately five feet wide.  There is also an approximately three foot by five foot landing at the top of the stair well.

Plywood decking should be one layer of ??? plywood with a second layer of ?? plywood.  The  plywood layers should be glued in addition to being nailed and the joints of the two plywood layers should be staggered, to provide a stronger flooring.


Two layers plywood decking ? Approximately 1,125 square feet each layer
2 x 4 wood joist ? Approximately 1,000 linear feet
Four inch resilent base ? Approximately 450 linear feet
26 Door Openings ? Transition strip / thresholds required

<DESC>Aerial Photography- Furnish aerial photographic services and related supplies in accordance with the requirements, specifications, terms, conditions specified herein. This will be an Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Qauntity contract for three years.  Up to three contractors will be awarded master contracts.  Two task orders will also be awarded at the time of original award. 

The general scope is to procure vertical aerial photography to typically support stream surveys, vegetation management, restoration projects, pre- and post-project monitoring, site design, post fire planning, natural resource inventory, orthophotography, and extraction of data by means of photogrammetric measurements. 

Aerial Camera Specifications: 
Tested and calibrated precision aerial cameras for taking aerial photographs are required. Only camera systems which meet the requirements of these specifications, as determined by a current USGS “Report of Calibration” test report, shall be used.  A camera system “Report of Calibration” will not be acceptable if more than three (3) years old at the scheduled date for receipt of offers.  
Lens Focal Length primarily needed is the 12 inch (305mm) and 8 ¼ inch (210mm).
Filters used should be antivignetting for normal color film or a yellow filter for color infrared (CIR).

Camera Operation:
The camera and its mount shall be checked for proper installation prior to each mission.
Particular attention shall be given to electrical circuits which control fiducial and camera data box lights and to the vacuum supply. In conformance with conventional photogrammetric practice, it is the preference of the Government that the contractor use camera configurations, that when installed in the aircraft, advance film parallel to the line of flight. The camera mount shall be regularly serviced and maintained and shall be insulated against aircraft vibration.

Camera Accessories:
An automatic exposure control device is permitted, but a manual override capability is required for some types of terrain to achieve proper exposure.

Aerial Film: 
Kodak 2444 Aerocolor III Negative or equal. Kodak 1443 infrared film or equal when color infrared is requested. All aerial film used on a project item shall be from one film type and manufacturer and be purchased by the Contractor. Extreme care shall be exercised to insure proper exposure and processing of film to minimize vignetting due to differential exposure. This differential shall not exceed that which would result from a basic ¼ stop difference in exposure.
All aerial film shall be free from chemicals, stains, tears, scratches, abrasions, water marks, finger marks, lint, dirt, and other physical defects. The imagery shall be clear and sharp in detail and uniform in density. It shall be free from light streaks, static marks, and other defects that would interfere with the intended purpose. All film shall be thoroughly fixed and washed to insure freedom from chemicals and shall be of archival quality.
Storage, exposure, and handling of all photographic materials shall be in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendation. The film shall not be rolled tightly on spools or in any way stretched, buckled, distorted, or exposed to excessive heat.

Maximum Film Roll Length:  200 feet.

Approximate Photographic Period: May 1 through September 30

Minimum Sun Angle: 
50 Degrees. Photography shall be undertaken only during that portion of the day when the sun angle exceeds the minimum specified.

Terrain Conditions:
The ground cover is mostly forest and mountainous terrain.

Photographic Conditions:
Photography shall be undertaken when skies are clear, free from smoke, clouds, cloud shadows, excessive haze, and well-defined images can be resolved. The ground shall be free from snow below timberline.

Overlaps:
Endlap: Optimum 62%, Minimum 57%, Maximum 67% 
Sidelap: Optimum 30%, Minimum 20%, Maximum 45%
                                                                                                                                    
Horizontal Deviation: 
Deviation from the plotted position of the flight line in excess of five (5) percent of a full print may cause rejection of any or all of the flight line.

Scale Deviation: 
Deviation from the Official Scale will be no more than 25%.

Crab: 
Any series of two or more photographs crabbed in excess of five degrees (5°) as measured between photographs in line and between adjoining lines may cause rejection of any or all of that particular flight line.

Tilt:
 Exposure made with the optical axis of the camera in a vertical position is desired. Tilt (departure from the vertical) on any exposure exceeding four degrees (4º) or relative tilt between any two successive exposures exceeding six degrees (6°) may be cause for rejection of any or all of the flight line.

Flight Plan Data:
The Contractor will be furnished the Official Flight Plan Data. The Official Flight Plan Data will determine project location, flight direction, datum breaks, and the flight altitude of each line above mean sea level. The Contractor will be furnished the latitude and longitude coordinates, expressed in degrees, minutes, seconds, and decimal seconds, of all beginning and ending terminal points of project flight lines. Data shall be in ASCII text format.  Small locator maps will also be provided.

Film Titling: 
Identifying data shall be placed in line along the most northerly flight edge of the aerial exposures of north-south flights and shall be placed along the western edge of the exposure in east-west flights. Flights along streams or NW, NE, SW, SE lines shall be titled on the upstream edge or the highest terrain edge. Titling shall include Flight Date, Government Agency (USFS), Photo Scale, Project Code, Run Number (no longer use the roll number) and Exposure Number (Number in unbroken series beginning with 1, not 001 or 01.).  In addition, the local standard time of exposure (PST) shall be titled on first and last exposure of each flight line and at each break in flight line, including breaks due to reflights.

Example:
8-8-08          10:14            USFS             1:6000          08026-SIU                1-1
 (Date)          (Time)         (Agency)        (Scale)       ( Project Code)      (Run #-Exposure#)
                     
The characters used in titling shall be standard block lettering 6.35mm (1/4 inch) high. They shall be sharp, legible, and uniformly applied with non-flaking black ink. The titling shall be placed on the non-emulsion side of the film and may be applied by use of an ink drawing pen or stamp. No smears or transfer of marking ink to other parts of the film roll will be permitted.

Prints:
Photographic papers of proper contrast must be used in making suitable prints to bring out all the details of the film image including clear identification of fiducials.  Full size (9”x 9”, 23cm x 23cm) color contacts must be printed for the best detail and color variances in riparian vegetation, stream channel debris, soils, and forest canopy.  Prints must be properly developed and thoroughly fixed and washed. They must be clean and free from stains, blemishes, uneven spots, air bells, fog, and finger marks.

Digital Photo Data File: 
Contractor shall prepare a digital photo-center data file for all aerial photography acquired under this solicitation. The file(s) shall be provided in ASCII comma delimited text format. A comma delimited header line (Project Description) shall precede the data in each file as shown in the example below. The latitude/longitude coordinates shall be expressed in decimal degrees with five (5) decimal places of precision (47.71936, -120.41498), formatted to NAD83 datum, and be accurate within 30 meters (100 feet) of the true photo center location. Longitude must be expressed as negative space for western hemisphere. Higher accuracies obtained through use of GPS technology are desirable but not required. The photo-center data shall include the following attributes:
Project Description: 
This should be the first line of all project exposure data and shall contain, at a minimum, the following:
Project code, Project name, State abbreviation, Photo scale, Film, Number of film rolls, Coordinate system datum, Coordinate collection method, Estimated accuracy of coordinates, Exposure data file creation date (MMDDYYYY)
Example:
07099-DES, Slapdap Fire, OR, 12K, Kodak 2444, 2, NAD83, GPS, 50m, 08152007
Exposure Data: 
This contains coordinates and other data, for each individual exposure for the entire project. The geographic coordinate data shall be expressed in decimal degrees, formatted to NAD83, and be accurate to within 100 feet (30m) of the true photo center location.  The Exposure Data shall contain the following data:   	                            
Flight line number, Exposure number, Exposure date (MMDDYYYY), Latitude (DD.DDDDD), Longitude (-DDD.DDDDD)
Example:
 2, 1, 08142007, 47.71936,-121.41498
Cascading set aside for HUB Zone contractors.  If unable to award to at least three qualified firms at a fair and reasonable price, then Small Businesses not in a HUB Zone area will be considered. The solicitation will be posted on FEDBIZOPPS on or about April 28, 2008.

<SUBJECT>54 -- Provide and Install a Mezzanine

<RESPDATE>041708
<CONTACT>Carol A. Wood, Contract Specialist/Contracting Officer, Phone 301-975-8172, Fax 301-975-8904, Email carol.wood@nist.gov - Todd D Hill, Phone 301-975-8802, Email todd.hill@nist.gov
<DESC>The above referenced solicitation is hereby cancelled in its entirety.

NIST has realized that additional changes to the scope of work are necessary since the space for the mezzanine has been cleared.  These changes, coupled with those already issued, are considered significant, and therefore, warrant a new statement of work and solicitation.  

While this solicitation is being cancelled in its entirety, NIST fully intends to resolicit this requirement under a different Request for Quotation Number.  A pre-solicitation notice and solicitation will be released on FedBizOpps (www.fedbizopps.gov).  The estimated timeline for reissuance of the solicitation is 2-4 weeks.

<DESC>THE ABOVE REFERENCED NOTICE IS MODIFIED AS FOLLOWS:


Amendment 1:  Question and Answer and due date extended TO APRIL 18.

Question:  

Can you provide the percentage of the population for each type of outpatient encounters (i.e. same day surgery, ancillary, E/M, specialty, etc.) in your universe? 

Answer:

We do not have that data readily available.  In general, our hospital facilities and their outpatient departments and provider based clinics are small rural hospitals with less then 15 average daily patient census, including 10 Critical Access Hospitals, serving a small population base.  Our 3 largest hospitals have 100 beds, 140 and 150 beds approximately (Phoenix, Anchorage and Gallup). I would estimate that up to 50-70% of visits to the hospital outpatient departments are for primary care and limited ancillary services;  30% would be for higher level of care.  This is unique to the IHS  hospitals because these facilities include family practice medicine located in the hospital outpatient departments. Trauma and major emergencies are transported to higher level facilities off reservation.  We have about 15 ambulatory surgery centers tied to the hospitals, which do minor surgeries.
