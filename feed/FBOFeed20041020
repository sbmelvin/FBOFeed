The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design for a new United States Border Station in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements.  This project will have a principal emphasis on site development, new construction and infrastructure improvements. The building is approximately 51,809 gross square feet on a Government owned site located in Warroad, Minnesota.  The Estimated Construction Cost range is $16 million to $18.5 million.  The facility will be designed in hard metric units.  The scope of work will require at a minimum: site and building design, metric construction drawings, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD) and post construction contract services (PCCS) for a United States Border Station that includes the construction of the new building and related systems, parking, development, client program development, socio-economic and sustainable program features.  This project is to include GSA design standards for secure facilities and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) & Customs and Border Protection (CBP) construction and security requirements, U.S. Port of Entry Design Guide, as well as specific tenant-agency security requirements. The project will provide a facility that meets energy goals and includes sustainable design and construction practices (LEED). This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) of A/E Firms/Lead Designers interested in contracting for this work.  The A/E firm as defined as in this RFQ is an association, joint venture, partnership or other entity that will have contractual responsibility for the project design.  The Lead Designer is the individual or design studio that will have primary responsibility for the design concept and the building’s architecture.  The A/E Firm must clearly define the contractual relationship with the Lead Designer and its ability to manage the design and production of construction for GSA.  The government will not allow payment for travel, living expense, computer time or hookups for the prime or the consultants related to meeting the requirements of this RFQ for Stage I. The A/E selection will be completed in two stages as follows: In Stage I, an interested firm will submit a portfolio of accomplishments to establish the design capabilities of the A/E Firm and its Lead Designer.  All documentation will be in an 8-1/2 x 11 format.  The Stage I submission should include the following: A) a cover letter referencing the Fed Biz Opps announcement and briefly describing the firm, its location, organizational makeup, and noteworthy accomplishments; B) Standard Form 330 (Architect-Engineer Requirements) modified to include only the A/E’s information (Identification of consultants is not required at this stage) and C) a design portfolio which is to include the following submission requirements and evaluation criteria:

<SUBJECT>35--Upgrade of Horiba Constant Volume Sampler for NonRoad Site

<ARCHDATE>12032004
<CONTACT>DAVID H. PLAGGE, Placement Contracting Officer, Phone: (513) 487-2022, E-Mail: plagge.david@epa.gov; TAMMY A. ADAMS, Contract Specialist, Phone: (513) 487-2030, E-Mail: adams.tammy@epa.gov
<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 12 and Part 13 Commercial and Simplified procedures, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Horiba Instruments to upgrade a  Horiba Constant Volume Sampler (CVS).  The Laboratory Operations Division performs research and development engine testing at EPA's NVFEL, which is located in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  Recently, a small engine test site was constructed to support the development of  new non-road regulations. The Horiba CVS to be upgraded dilutes engine exhaust which is then analyzed to determine emission components.  It is one of the main components on the test site.  The CVS is more than ten years old and EPA can no longer get replacement microprocessors or programming changes.  The communication system that is employed is outdated, so it is difficult to exchange data with more modern components on the test site.  In order to comply with the requirements of the nonroad test program and stay on the testing schedule, at least one CVS will need to be upgraded with new control electronics, communications, transducers and sample pumps.   The Contractor shall design, fabricate, deliver, install and performance-test the specified upgrades and assure that they meet the requirements  of the nonroad test program.  A spare Horiba CVS also exists.  The upgrade of this second unit will be included as an option under this acquisition.  Given that these units were manufactured and designed by Horiba Instruments, EPA knows of no other source that has the knowledge, expertise and programming skills to be able to provide the required services and as such intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Horiba Instruments.   THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability and respond to the office identified above.  Documentation must be received by November 3 in order to be considered by the EPA. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon assessment of responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties should submit a written response to David Plagge by fax (513) 487-2107 or by e-mail plagge.david@epa.gov to receive consideration for this contract. Telephone responses will not be honored.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>I.  PURPOSE.  The purposes of this Request for Information (RFI) are to solicit early industry involvement in defining a communications infrastructure system for data and voice to support municipal operational agencies, and to seek information about potential bidders. The system will transmit and receive data related to Near Real Time Video (Closed Circuit Television (CCTV)) for alarm assessment and surveillance, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Electronic Access Control (EAC), as well as to prov ide for land mobile radio type of service.  The area of interest spans nine NY state counties: Westchester, Ulster, Schoharie, Sullivan, Green, Duchess, Putnam, Delaware, and Orange.  Note that this area includes mountains.  The system will support up to 1 500 voice and data sources, including up to 750 mobile voice and (some) mobile low rate data users.  The system should reach all fixed users and provide 85% coverage for mobile users in the area of interest.  For the purposes of traffic assumptions, assume  that there will be 6 to 12 centers that have concentrated traffic requirements from other users, and between these centers with an additional traffic requirement between up to 3 of these centers related to database information exchange.  Most traffic exce pt CCTV is full duplex.  If your proposed solution involves towers, assume that perhaps 10-15 existing towers in the area could be used and any additional would have to be constructed.  Buying or leasing of spectrum is an option to the extent that such spe ctrum might be available.  Licensed band operation is strongly preferred.  II. TARGET CAPABILITIES. The communications infrastructure shall provide connectivity to fixed sites and mobile voice users throughout the 9 county areas and include the following capabilities: (a) Provide voice, data, and (compressed) video infrastructure .

<DESC>UPDATE (10-20-04) Change in Pricing Strategy The first draft Request for Proposal (RFP) stated that the pricing structure  for the contract will be 5 years firm-fixed-price (FFP), 3 years fixed price  with economic price adjustment (FP/EPA), and 2 years Not to Exceed (NTE).  As  part of the internal review process for RFP+s, it has become evident that it is  in the best interest of both the Government and the offerors to change the  pricing structure of the contract to 5 years FFP and 5 years FP/EPA.  The  current constraints on NTE options would negatively impact both the flexibility  of the contract and the level of confidence in the out years.   If you have any questions or comments, please contact the contractual POC  listed below. Contractual POC: Jim Van Oss, Contract Negotiator, james.vanoss@wpafb.af.mil,  937-904-4192, ASC/YTA, Bldg 11A, Room 201-I, 1970 Monahan Way, WPAFB, OH 45433- 7211. //End of Update// UPDATE (10-14-2004) AC vs. DC Seat Actuator on T-38 ESUP The purpose of this announcement is to provide information regarding a question  about seat actuators from the recent Industry Day.  Because this information  could have a significant impact on potential solutions, it is being released  prior to the posting of the other questions and answers.   Changing from Alternating Current to Direct Current Seat Actuators for the T- 38C ESUP  This question was forwarded to OO-ALC/LCEA for their review and comment.  They  recommend we do not use DC actuators if at all possible.  The DC load is taxed  with the AUP upgrade and other changes are pending to add further loads to the  DC buss.  The change to DC would also require an aircraft rewire to add a  circuit breaker and cabling.  It would be less of an impact to use AC actuators  and a much simpler modification to the aircraft.  The present AC system has 5  amp circuit breakers.  If at one half the capacity of the 5 amp breaker (2.5  amps,) 2.5 X 115 volts=287.5 VA.  With DC of 28 volts equals 10 amps current  draw.  Conservatively, this is approximately one fifth the battery capacity.   Operation of both seats at the same time would further impact the battery  drain.  The battery is rated for 15 minutes of aircraft operation in an  emergency situation.  Taxing of the battery capability in anyway is not  desirable. If you have any questions, please contact the contractual POC below.

Please respond to these questions at your earliest convenience but NLT 3:00 pm  EST on 8 Oct 2004.  If you have any questions or concerns please contact the  contractual POC listed below. Contractual POC: Jim Van Oss, Contract Negotiator, james.vanoss@wpafb.af.mil,  937-904-4192, ASC/YTA, Bldg 11A, Room 201-I, 1970 Monahan Way, WPAFB, OH 45433- 7211. //End of Update// UPDATE (9-30-04) PROSPECTIVE OFFEROR VISITS TO RANDOLPH AFB AND MOODY AFB In a recent Industry Day, it was requested the Government provide access to the  Egress Procedures Trainers (EPTs), Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs), survival  kit equipment, and a T-38C aircraft with the aft cockpit instrument hood in  place. The above items can be made available upon written request and demonstrated  interest in this program.  However, these items are available on a non- interference basis and access is by appointment only.  Please note that a visit  to Randolph AFB and Moody AFB will be required.     If your company is interested in arranging a time to visit these items and you  plan to respond to the T-38C ESUP RFP, please contact the contractual POC  listed below at your earliest convenience but no later than 12:00 pm EST on 4  Oct 2004.  Further instructions will be provided upon receipt of your request. RFP SCHEDULE UPDATE The second draft RFP will be released in sections between now and 22 Oct 2004.   As these sections are released, please review and provide comments within 3  business days.  The Final RFP is currently planned to be released on 10  November 2004.  Offeror responses to the Past Performance section will be  required approximately one month after RFP release.  Written proposals,  representative seat and associated hardware for installation and measurement in  the T-38C forebody will be required approximately two months after RFP release.

<CONTACT>Alonzo Jacobs, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-720-7335, Fax 202-690-0689, Email alonzo.jacobs@usda.gov
<DESC>Questions and answers are as follows:

Question 1:  In addition to knowing the locations of CRP lands, will it be
possible to request the CRP practice employed on each CRP parcel as well as
the nature of the lands around the parcels?  For example, if we were to propose that a buffer of a certain distance be created around each Breeding Bird Survey route, could FSA provide an analysis of the number of acres of each CRP practice and the date of
enrollment for each parcel that fell within that buffer area?  Also, does FSA have additional data on the crop types planted on an annual basis around each CRP parcel?  Currently NASS has a Cropland Data Layer, but that is only available for a relatively few states in the Midwest and southcentral U.S.  The USGS has the National Land Cover Database, but it still relies upon 1992 data for many regions and will not have updated the entire U.S. to 2001 data until 2006 or 7.  Does FSA have any supplemental land cover, crop cover data to supplement these two resources?  Does FSA have the resources to provide such an analysis during the timeframe of this proposed project?

Response 1: The CRP practice will be available in an overlay with each breeding bird survey point.  This overlay will be fully accurate for whole field practices, and somewhat less accurate for partial field practices such as buffers. Partial field practices will be identified by the field in which they are established but where in that field they fall.  It is Important to Note: that the digitized information for the FSA common land unit (CLU) data is still being developed and will not be available for all sites. Progress can be viewed at http://fsagis.usda.gov/clutracking/.

The information regarding the adjacent crop over time is not going to be readily available because the CLU digitized information is for 2004 and previous year data will not be loaded in time for the wildlife analysis.

Question 2:  Regarding this RFP, are we talking about proposals entertained in the
$10K or $500K range?  

Response 2:  All proposals will be considered during the evaluation process.  The Government estimate is not releasable.

Question 3:  We have the expertise to collect and model the existing
(and newly acquired) spatial data, but do not believe these data will be
meaningful without ground truthing to validate the models relative to
bobwhite (and other grassland bird) responses.  We would be interested in developing a Habitat Suitability Index for CRP contracts for bobwhites in the Rolling Plains region of Texas.  We'd investigate  such parameters as type of vegetation (native or exotic grass), amount of shrub cover that has subsequently invaded the CRP contract, and juxtaposition of the CRP contract in the overall landscape (i.e., is it adjacent to other suitable quail habitat [brushy rangeland].  If you don't have some ground truthing to validate your models, what have you gained by this exercise?  

Response 3:  The issue you raise is valid. If one is seeking a model for a specific parcel then the vegetation on that land is vital. However, if the succession that takes place on CRP lands in a region for a given practice follows a generally consistent pattern, then the validation would not be necessary to make an appraisal of the effect of the CRP on population numbers over time.  While, fully validated information on vegetative cover would be preferable because it would provide information on invasive species, and other effects, the fact is that such information is beyond the budget available.  For a first cut FSA needs a general model for regional population effects. This is why the RFP specifies the analysis of existing data and specifies the regions to be examined.  A model of quail populations for 15 counties is of interest, but would not meet the minimum specifications.
 
Question 4:  I understand that FSA will have completed digitizing the CRP Lands for the central part of the country (excluding Texas) in time for use in this project.  I was curious whether plans exist to digitize the locations of CRP lands for the rest of the country in the future?  If so, what is the planned schedule for that effort?

Response 4:  The answer is that FSA is digitizing the entire country as rapidly as possible.  The progress is shown on http://fsagis.usda.gov/clutracking/  The digitized information will not be available to the contractors in raw form due to farmer privacy rights and FSA concerns for protecting these rights.  That said FSA has arranged for digitized farm data to be merged with out dataset in a manner that protects landowner privacy but allows statistical examination of the data.

Question 5:  Our group of biologists has extensive experience in surveying for a variety of species in many types of habits. We also have developed models for estimating population size in a variety of species and habitats.  Although we have not worked specifically with the species outlined in the RFP, we have the skill set needed to evaluate the population and habitat data sources that are available for this project. My question is: will you be giving higher scores to those with specific experience with these species, or will proposals with the appropriate experience in evaluating survey methods, data sets, and modeling populations get equal or greater scores? Obviously, it would be ideal to have both...
 
Response 5:  All other things being equal someone with demonstrated  experience with a particular species would be viewed as being more capable than someone that does not have that experience.  However, there are a number of mitigating factors. For example, having a demonstrated experience making statistically valid population estimates would be preferable to non-quantitative experience; for two individuals with similar publication records, but one individual being a graduate student and the other being a full professor would lead to the professor being selected.

Question 6:  Is it possible for USDA to disburse payments to multiple partners rather than just the agency the program manager represents?

Response 6:  No, payments can only be made to the contract holder as identified on the award documents.  Award of a contract can only be made to a single entity.  The entity to receive award must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) system (see http://www.ccr.gov).  This does not preclude the award of multiple contracts under this solicitation.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to republish the original announcement, with administrative corrections, pursuant to FAR 35.016(c).  The administrative change is: Correct the mailing address of the technical POC.  Previous modifications are incorporated into this republishing.  No other changes have been made.

Technical POC: Bernard J. Clarke, Program Manager, 315-330-2106; (Bernard.Clarke@rl.af.mil) and Contracting POC: Lori L. Smith, Contracting Officer, 315-330-1955; (Lori.Smith@rl.af.mil). AFRL Rome Research Site is soliciting white papers for innovative approaches in the following topic areas: AFRL seeks to support the intelligence community by developing systems and software tools for the collection, processing, analysis, simulation and modeling of directed energy weapons. The weapons of interest include radio frequency (RF), charged particle beam, neutral particle beam, and lasers. Of interest are not only high-tech military threats, but also the capability to gain intelligence information from weapons built from Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) components or commercially available turnkey systems. The directed energy threats of interest may include ground-based, airborne and space-based threats. Proposed collection systems may be intended for airborne, space-based or ground based platforms. White papers offered for consideration should provide a means to assist in the analysis of Scientific and Technical (S&T) analysis of directed energy threats. Beam characteristics of interest with respect to particle beam weapons include: particle type, beam energy, beam current, spread, pulse width (PW), and pulse repetition interval (PRI). S&T parameters of interest for laser intelligence (LASINT) and RF directed energy include: wavelength, PW, PRI, laser output power, beam divergence, continuous wave or pulsed, and angle of arrival (AOA). THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ENTIRE SOLICITATION. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. Offerors are required to submit five (5) copies of a three (3) to four (4) page white paper with a cover letter. The white paper will be formatted as follows: Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company; Section B: Task Objective; Section C: Technical Summary. Offerors must mark their white papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609. All responses to this announcement must be addressed to ATTN: Bernard Clarke, Reference BAA-01-03-IFKPA, AFRL/IFEC, 525 Brooks Road, Suite C1, Rome, NY 13441-4505. Multiple white papers may be submitted in different areas of technology. White papers will be accepted until September 30, 2005. The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest under this BAA. Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a subsequent award. Proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received. Individual proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or non-acceptability without regard to other proposals submitted under the announcement. Evaluation of proposals will be performed using the following criteria: a) The overall scientific and/or technical merits of the proposal, b) The innovativeness of the proposed approach and/or techniques, c) The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees, and d) The Government will consider other factors, such as past and present performance on recent Government contracts and the capacity and capability to perform the requirements of the effort. The criteria used to evaluate proposals will also be used to determine whether white papers submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government. Only (a), (b), and (c) above will apply to white papers. Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award. Principal funding of this BAA and the anticipated award of contracts will start in FY-01. Individual awards will normally range from 6 months to 36 months with dollar amounts ranging from $25,000 to $2,000,000 per year. Total funding for this BAA is approximately $15M. Awards of efforts as a result of this BAA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed. Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitation for proposal submissions. All responsible firms may submit a white paper, which shall be considered. Responders are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number with their submission as well as a fax number, and an e-mail address. Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures. Foreign or foreign-owned offerors should immediately contact the contracting focal point, Renee F. Arcuri, for information if they contemplate responding. Export-controlled technical data may be involved; only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed to access such data. For further information on CCAL, contact the Defense Logistic Service Center at 1-800-352-3572. Selected offerors may be required to review classified material up to the SCI level, therefore personnel identified for assignment to the proposed effort must be cleared for, or access to SCI information. Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require an SCI facility clearance and safeguarding capability. The cost of preparing proposals in response this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract.  It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY-01- 01 Mar 01; FY-02-30Jul01; FY-03-30Jul02; FY-04-30Jul03 FY-05-30Jul05. White papers will be accepted at any time, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each Fiscal Year after the dates cited. This BAA is open and effective until September 30, 2005. A copy of the Rome "BAA & PRDA: A Guide for Industry," Sep 1996 (Rev), may be accessed at: http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/div/IFK/bp-guide.html. All responsible organizations may submit a white paper, which shall be considered. Offerors are warned that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to republish the original announcement, with administrative corrections, pursuant to FAR 35.016(c).  The administrative change is: Correct the mailing address of the technical POC.  Previous modifications are incorporated into this republishing.  No other changes have been made.

Technical POC/ Program Manager, Mr. Fred Rahrig, (315) 330-3906, 525 Brooks Road, Rome, NY, 13441-4505, telephone: (315) 330-3906, email: Fred.Rahrig@rl.af.mil.  Contracting POC: AFRL/IFKA, Lori L. Smith, Contracting Officer, 26 Electronic Parkway, NY 13441-4514, telephone: (315) 330-1955, email: Lori.Smith@rl.af.mil.  The Information Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) at the Rome Research Site is seeking firms to conduct applied research and advanced development in Commercial Imagery Archive & Information Dissemination (CIAID).  Research and Development (R&D) efforts shall be directed to provide advancements in the Commercial Imagery (CI) based technology areas to support Air Force and DOD operational missions.  These areas include improved digital geospatial dissemination capabilities, permitting rapid dissemination of large data sets through electronic means; spectral technology, including the integration and fusion of spectral imagery and geospatial data in relationship to intelligence exploitation and support to military operations; and improved speed and accuracy methods for generating and performing digital geographic and geolocation mensuration.  This program will develop, employ and exploit technologies to provide advanced prototype capabilities for potential transitions to operational units.  It will also enhance existing and maturing technologies to provide continued spiral development over the seven year program.  Objective:  The application of CI resources has shown great potential to contribute to the defense information and intelligence mission in the areas of surveillance and reconnaissance, mission planning, target graphics and product generation.  This procurement will assist the government in the establishment of a CIAID R&D Facility, a center of excellence, for technical development of CI technologies, supporting prototype demonstrations of these technologies, and evaluation and selection of transitionable technologies to appropriate organizations and systems.  These organizations and systems are expected to include the 480th Intelligence Wing (480 IW), 36th Intelligence Squadron, Geospatial Product Library Sites, Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS), National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), and others as applicable.  Technical Background: The Air Force and other DOD organizations have fostered the use of CI to augment various requirements to support operational missions for the past several years.  For the most part, the results have been widely accepted, and show great potential for providing many new revolutionary information production technologies.  Selected CI related processes have begun to filter into standard production operations, some of which are prototypes.  It is envisioned that this PRDA will provide the means to effectively enact accelerated research, development, test, and evaluation, and ultimately result in more rapid CI technology insertion.  Innovative CIAID Research and Development White Paper Solicitation: AFRL/IFE is soliciting White Papers that provide innovative CIAID research and development.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION FOR CIAID WHITE PAPERS. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. Offerors are required to submit an unclassified original plus (3) copies of their White Papers for the CIAID PRDA to AFRL/IFEC, ATTN: Fred Rahrig, Ref. PRDA 03-07-IFKA, 525 Brooks Road, Rome, NY 13441-4505 no earlier than thirty (30) days after the publication of this PRDA. White Papers are limited to a total page count of ten (10) pages and shall be double-spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch.  A softcopy of the white paper in Microsoft Word must also be provided. The White Paper will be formatted as follows: Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company; Section B: Task Objective; and Section C: Technical Summary. Offerors must mark their White Papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a).  Multiple White Papers may be submitted in different areas of technology.  White Papers will be accepted until 30 Sept 2009.  It is recommended that White Papers be received early in each Fiscal Year, e.g., April, to maximize the possibility of award.  However, White Papers will be accepted at any time, but it is more likely that funding will be available during the early portion of each Fiscal Year.  The purpose of the White Paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest under this PRDA.  Those White Papers found to be consistent with the intent of this PRDA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will receive a subsequent award.  White Papers submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitations for proposal submissions.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.  All responsible firms may submit proposals or White Papers, as appropriate, which shall be considered.  Respondents are asked to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number, an e-mail address, and a fax number with their submittal(s) and reference PRDA 03-07-IFKA.  Awards:  A single award in FY 03 for thirty-six (36) months at an estimated $7M is anticipated.  Details are:  Contract description:  Commercial Imagery Group Archive & Retrieval Support System (CIGARSS):  Create an integrated information architecture to support near and long term CI digital data production operations; Provide an extensible computing environment based on interoperable and standard interfaces: - NGA United States Imagery and Geospatial Information Service (USIGS) - Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) - OpenGIS Consortium; Develop turnkey integrated solutions that facilitate integration and accreditation of emerging technologies; Establish and maintain the technical foundation for common AF geospatial data accessibility as being established by the Geospatial Product Library (GPL); Transition integrated solutions to Support Operations at 480 IW, AF/XOIRY, AC2ISRC, and NGA.  The principal funding of this PRDA and the contemplated award is anticipated to occur in 3Q FY03. Subsequent awards will normally range from 12 to 24 months with dollar amounts typically ranging from $500,000 to $2,000,000 for advanced technology development and integration efforts, per award. Contractor teaming is encouraged.  The total value for all awards under this PRDA is not anticipated to exceed $17,000,000.  AFRL requires innovative, yet demonstrable and usable solutions to meet the needs of this PRDA.  Deliverables will be advanced prototype software applications and integrated system solutions.  Awards of efforts as a result of this PRDA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed. Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award.  Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished using the following criteria: (l) overall scientific and technical merit, (2) potential contribution and relevance to this effort, (3) innovativeness of the proposed approach and/or techniques, (4) offerors capabilities and related experience, and (5) cost and fee realism and reasonableness.  In addition, the Government will consider other factors such as, past and present performance on recent Government contracts and the capacity to perform the described effort.  Experience with, and access to, CIAID migration systems will be considered when said migration systems are integral to the proposed work.  Criteria 1 through 4 above will also be used to determine whether White Papers submitted are consistent with the intent of this PRDA and of interest to the Government.  White paper evaluations will be based on acceptability or unacceptability without regard to other submittals/awards under this PRDA.  Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award.  Government Furnished Information/Equipment (GFI/GFE): Required GFI/GFE shall be specified in the white papers for evaluation.  No minimum facility clearance, safeguarding capability, or personnel clearances are necessary for a CIAID award.  However, these could be required based upon the offeror's proposed role and contribution.  As such, depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require facility clearance and safeguarding capability up to TOP SECRET; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for the appropriate access up to TOP SECRET SI/TK information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed access to such data.  Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures.  Foreign or foreign-owned offerors should immediately contact the contracting office focal point, Lori L. Smith, Contracting Officer, telephone (315) 330-1955 or e-mail Lori.Smith@rl.af.mil for information if they contemplate responding.  The e-mail must reference the title and PRDA 03-07-IFKA.  Technical questions during the white paper development phase of this acquisition should be e-mailed directly to the Program Manager, Fred Rahrig at: Fred.Rahrig@rl.af.mil. Questions and answers will be posted to http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/div/IFK/prda/prda03xx/CIAIDQ&A.html within 48 hours after collection, thereby providing adequate time for the response. Questions of a contractual or administrative nature should be forwarded to the Contracting Officer, Lori Smith, e-mail Lori.Smith@rl.af.mil.  Questions will be answered on a non-attribution basis.  Questions, clarifications, or concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition should be communicated directly to the IFKA Contracting Officer, Lori.Smith, e-mail Lori.Smith@rl.af.mil. The email must reference the title and solicitation number of the acquisition.  Questions and answers may be posted to the Federal Business Opportunities site within 48 hours after collection, thereby providing adequate time for the response.  A copy of the Rome "BAA& PRDA: A Guide for Industry," Sep 1996 (Rev), may be accessed at: http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/div/IFK/bp-guide.html.  An informational briefing/industry day is not planned.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors.  Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in this contract or order, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals.  Examples of the administrative tasks performed include:a.  Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b.  Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and  c.  Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the contracting officer within and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY FOR PLANNING PURPOSES.  
THERE IS NO SOLICITATION DRAWING PACKAGE AVAILABLE.

This is a request for information only as defined in 
FAR 15.201(e).

The government does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain information on commercially available applications.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  

The Air Warfare Battlelab (AWB), Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho, is planning to conduct a study that will evaluate commercial options to solve the following problem:  

Currently, United States Air Force deploys Ground Mobile Force (GMF) satellite terminals around the world to support steady state and contingency operations. These terminals uplink/downlink with Defense Satellite Communications Systems (DSCS) satellites.  
Communications technicians are tasked on occasions to perform site surveys prior to deployment of these terminals to determine suitability of the location. There is currently no handheld site survey tool that allows technicians to determine not only 
their latitude and longitude, but calculate the "point angle" (azimuth and elevation) to DSCS satellites.  Technicians must also take into account the magnetic declination of the area that they are performing the site survey at. The AWB is interested in existing Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products, technologies, or solutions that could be used as-is or slightly modified 

   These attributes are desired requirements by the USAF:

1. Handheld device able to calculate azimuth and elevation to DSCS satellites from site survey location.
2. Ability to operate in varying weather conditions (desert heat, cold, rain, etc..)
3. Ability to operate device on battery power.
4. Minimal periodic maintenance on device.

The AWB is seeking the following specific information from industry representatives:

1. The manufacturers suggested retail price for the commercial product.
2. The name of distributors who could sell to the Government.
3. The degree to which the product can meet or exceed the above desirable and beneficial attributes of the USAF.
4. Your interest to demonstrate your product.

Requested information must be submitted NO LATER THAN 21 Nov 04 to MSgt Brian Marinelli, Air Warfare Battlelab, 360 Gunfighter Ave, Suite 1, Mountain Home AFB, ID 83648.  
MSgt Brian Marinelli can be reached at (208)828-3539 or brian.marinelli@mountainhome.af.mil.  
A formal solicitation MAY NOT BE ISSUED as a result of this RFI.  Information provided may or may not be included in a formal solicitation.  The USAF will not release any information --marked with a Proprietary legend -- received in response to this RFI to any firms, agencies, or individuals outside the USAF without written permission in accordance with the legend.

<DESC>1.1 INTRODUCTION.  The GSA Federal Systems Integration and Management Center (FEDSIM) on behalf of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are considering the introduction of state of the art technology into the FDA infrastructure to achieve a Structured Product Labeling (SPL) capability.  SPL is a strategic initiative for achieving FDA’s mission to process labeling information electronically.  The Government is soliciting information to identify potential approaches to building the SPL IT system.  The Government is also seeking information from hardware and software vendors to ensure that all available commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS), government-off-the-shelf (GOTS), and custom/hybrid products that provide capabilities applicable to the SPL have been identified.  All manufacturers and suppliers of hardware and software technology that could be applied to support management of labels across their lifecycles are offered this opportunity to describe how the Government can best employ their products to meet SPL mission needs.  1.2 BACKGROUND.  The FDA wishes to automate current processes with IT systems that would automate and significantly improve the performance of the drug labeling review process and transfer of labeling data.  The FDA was recognized by the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics (NCVHS) as the basic source for drug product terminology and information because of its regulatory responsibility for approving safe and effective drug products in the United States.  FDA, working with the industry, has developed SPL as a format for exchanging labeling information among computer systems.  In September 2004, industry began using the SPL document format to begin submitting labeling information to the FDA.  Currently, the FDA is reviewing this information manually to assess changes, make approval determinations, and share with other Government agencies.  The overall purpose of this project is to improve patient safety by ensuring that medication information is readily available to health care providers, patients and the public in its most up-to-date form.  The project is part of a larger initiative called the DailyMed.  The DailyMed Initiative is a partnership between the FDA, medication manufacturers and distributors, the National Library of Medicine (NLM), and healthcare information suppliers.  Additional information on the SPL background can be found in the High Level Requirements Document; [see section 1.5. below]  1.3 PROGRAM OBJECTIVES.  The overall objective of the FDA Structured Product Labeling project is to create a technological environment that will enable FDA to reliably generate up-to-date SPL for all drug products marketed in the United States.  Later phases can potentially address other FDA-regulated products including vaccines, animal drug products, dietary supplements and medical devices.  SPL file information contains the following medication data: (1) How to use medication - dosing recommendations and monitoring use; (2) When to use medication - indication, clinical effects (e.g., interactions and adverse events), activity (e.g., mechanism of action), other information about the use of the medication; (3) Description of the medication - names, ingredients, strength, appearance, dosage form; (4) How the medication is supplied - name, package type, quantity; and (5) Distributor of the medication.  Achieving this objective will require a new technical approach to reviewing, processing, and sharing label information.  Additional information on the SPL objectives can be found in the SPL High Level Requirements Document; [see section 1.5. below]  1.4 PROJECT SCOPE.  The scope of the expected work is developing the computer systems (hardware and software) that will enable FDA to realize the project objectives.  The computer system and a technical environment will support processing and managing of label information as well as labeling supplements in the SPL XML format.  Labeling reviewers will review and approve SPL submissions and disseminate the approved SPLs to Health Care Community/Public using the developed system.  A major system component of the SPL project is the Labeling System, which will be used to validate received SPL submissions and help to provide the most up-to-date information to the public, preventing medication errors and adverse events.  The system will also support the labeling review process performed by labeling reviewers.  In order to facilitate the labeling review process, the system will have interfaces with external systems (i.e., Tracking System for tracking information on new SPL submissions and Receiving Systems for receipt of incoming SPL submissions).  Project scope also includes development and/or integrating supporting technology including the Listing System, Ingredients/UNII System, and Registration System.  All approved SPLs will need to be transmitted to the central repository NLM for dissemination to the Health Care Community/Public.  The Government perceives this project to be developed using a phased approach; the first release is scheduled to be implemented six months after project award and the final expected to be implemented eighteen months after project award.  The first increment will incorporate sufficient core functionality to achieve an Initial Operational Capability. Unimplemented requirements will be allocated to successive increments as needed to achieve Full Operational Capability.  The goals of the Phase 1 tentatively would be to develop systems that will register ingredients information and generate the UNII codes and process, review, approve, and disseminate electronic SPL submissions for approved prescription drugs.  The new systems will be integrated with the existing FDA systems.  The goals of the Phase 2 tentatively would be to develop systems that will process drug-listing information and create drug product codes and register information about manufactures, repackers, and relabelers.  The new systems will be integrated with the existing systems. After the Phase 2 is implemented, SPL submissions for all drug products will be processed.  The FDA expects the system to be capable of supporting 5,000 non-concurrent FDA users.  The system is expected to be capable of handling at least 1,000 SPL original submissions per year and 15,000 label modifications per year.  Indefinite data retention is expected for valid label information and archiving may be leveraged.  Response handling shall have performance of less than 10 seconds for up to 1,000 concurrent users and 15 seconds for greater numbers.  The system must be compliant with Section 508 and with applicable FDA and CDER policies.  Offers should review the CDER Technical Reference Model and Standards Profile and FDA policies 3250.26 and 3250.27 to understand the current list of approved technologies and applicable FDA security guidance; both resources can be located in the following section.  Additional functional and non-functional requirements and their applicable scope phase can be found in SPL High Level Requirements.  This document further defines the functional, technical, workflow, integration, and reporting requirements for each sub-system and system-level requirements for performance, security, and system administration.  1.5 REFERENCE SOURCES.

<SUBJECT>A -- LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY TO COMMERCIALIZE A PORTABLE LOW ENERGY NEUTRON SOURCE FOR HIGH SENSITIVITY MATERIAL CHARACTERIZATION
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY TO COMMERCIALIZE A PORTABLE LOW ENERGY NEUTRON SOURCE FOR HIGH SENSITIVITY MATERIAL CHARACTERIZATION

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking one or more industrial partners to commercialize LLNL's portable low energy neutron source for high sensitivity material characterization. 

Neutron generators based on RFQ accelerators are in use at a number of sites worldwide.  Most of these systems use proton or deuteron beam bombarding rugged beryllium targets at selected output energies and currents. However, they can also be used with other targets to produce neutron spectra tailored to specific applications.  

For certain material characterization objectives, such as the presence of fissionable material, it is highly desirable to have a portable source of low energy neutrons that can be transported easily to field sites and quickly set-up and operated.  In addition, it is desirable that there be no fast neutrons in the emitted beam to be able to provide a unique signal for the presence of fission. Since a nuisance background of fast neutrons is always present with a source of fast neutrons, it is desirable that all the neutrons given off directly by the source be at a low energy.  

Previously, all electric proton accelerators have been large (~tons). LLNL has developed a portable, electrically generated, low energy neutron source for in-field characterization. This new system makes use of low-voltage, pulsed-RF acceleration to obtain energetic particles useful in nuclear reactions that produce low energy neutrons.

LLNL is currently filing patent applications for its portable electric proton source, suitable for making low energy neutrons.

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's portable low energy neutron source for high sensitivity material characterization should provide a written statement of interest that includes:
1.	Company name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	Description of corporate capabilities relevant to commercializing the technology.

Written responses should be directed to:
	Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
	Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
	P.O. Box 808, L-795
	Livermore, CA  94551-0808
	Attention:  FBO 85-04.
Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest.

<SUBJECT>R -- IRIA Two Month Extension W/ Option
<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) plans to award a sole source modification for a two-month extension with (1) two-month Option to Veridan Systems Division, Inc. (Veridan) in support of the Infrared Information Analysis Center (IRIA) under contract SP0900-96-D-0080. Veridan is the only source to provide IRIA services within the required timeframe. This action represents a bridge extension until a competitive follow-on acquisition is awarded. Veridan has the operational capability in place for continuous DoD-wide demand for technical support in the area of Infrared Technology. Award to any other source would require transition and start-up time that would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling ongoing critical agency requirements. This synopsis is a notice of intent to issue award using other than full and open competition and should not be a request for competitive proposals. The determination of the Government not to open subject requirement to full and open competition was made IAW 6.302-1 and 10 U.S.C. 2304 © (1).

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information contained in this notice. This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13. This announcement constitutes the formal Request for Quotation (RFQ) and a written solicitation WILL NOT be issued. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the September 2001 Federal Acquisition Regulation revision, which includes the consolidation of all Federal Acquisition Circulars through 97-27. This acquisition is 100% small business set-aside and the NAICS code is 541512 with a small business size standard of $21.0 million.  It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to negotiate on a sole source basis with Ms. Kathleen Chiacchierini, Gaithersburg, Maryland to provide expert services to the NIH Business System (NBS) Project for the functional administration and Management Center activities related to the newly deployed NBS Travel System. These services are related specifically to technical and related administration issues and activities on the NBS project.  NIH previously completed a comprehensive management and systems analysis to define the requirements for a new administrative computing system and evaluated potential systems to satisfy these requirements. The analysis determined that the NIH must replace its current system with an off-the-shelf software product. As part of this implementation, NIH has engaged the services of numerous functional specialists to help design and configure the software to suit NIH needs. NIH requires the detailed technical services to support the NBS project for a base period of 1 year and 21/2 year option periods.  Specifically, the contractor shall support the NBS project Manager in the following areas: 1) Provide Level 3 support to NBS Management Center for all travel- related issues; 2) Perform all duties of functional Global Administrator for NBS Travel System including configurations and maintenance of IC workflow; 3) Test all system functionality during upgrades; code enhancements and pre-deployment activities related to NBS deployment of Tracks 3 and 4; and 4) Support all activities related to the HHS/NIH deployment of eTravel.  Following these analyses, the contractor prepares draft policy documents/memoranda/reports/presentations for NBS review. 

Ms. Chiacchierini has provided travel expertise and travel system knowledge to the NBS project since June 1, 2001.  During that time, she worked on every aspect of the NBS Travel System culminating in a successful deployment on September 1, 2003.  These activities included, but were not limited to, development and testing, design and configure, workflow requirements, documentation, and change management training.  Prior Ms. Chiacchierini was employed as a contractor/travel instructor for over 15 years at the NIH; working with CIT to develop the business rules for the legacy Administrative Database Travel System (ADB).  Additionally, Ms. Chiacchierini has been a travel instructor for many other HHS OPDIVs.  Therefore, she will require no orientation to NIH technical and administrative systems. 


Ms. Chiacchierini has vast technical knowledge of the type required by the NBS project. NIH has determined that Ms. Chiacchierini  is the only source with the unique combination of required expertise and experience who can successfully complete the requirements listed above. This notice of intent is not a Request for Competitive Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available. However, NIH will consider all proposals received within 15 days from the date of publication of this synopsis.  Solicitation Number 05-008/RDB must be referenced in the response.  All capabilities statements received in response to this notice will be evaluated based on the following evaluation criteria:  1) Expert knowledge of NIH Travel systems which includes GELCO travel system and Etravel, – 50%; 2) Experience in the NIH Administrative Data Base. – 5%; 3) Experience and knowledge in designing and implementing a new enterprise system – 35%; 4) Experience in data analysis, writing policies and conduct presentations to higher level-officials – 10%. The contractor shall comply with all applicable Federal, State and local laws, executive orders, rules and regulations applicable to its performance under this order. Full text of clauses and provisions are available at Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR): http://www.arnet.qov/far/. The following clauses and provisions apply to this acquisition and may be obtained from the web sites: 52.212-1, instructions to Offerers-Commercial Items (JAN 2004), FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items (OCT 2003), FAR Clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders—Commercial Items (JUN 2004).

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

"Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent? for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.

(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 

(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, which is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ); quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for High Altitude Flight Test (HAFT)Balloon Launch Services according to the specifications outlined below.  A.	BACKGROUND SUMMARY NASA / Ames Research Center (NASA) has recently completed High Altitude Flight Tests 1 and 2 (HAFT1 and 2). For these tests a Mars airplane prototype NASA 731, was used. This prototype was jointly developed by NASA and the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL). Balloon launch services were provided by contracted services.  NASA has recently been awarded proposal work to develop the Mars Advanced Technology Airplane for Deployment, Operations, and Recovery (MATADOR) The work requires a minimum of two HAFTs. One additional, OPTIONAL, SEPARATELY PRICED, HAFT may be considered by NASA based on an assessment of funding availability and risk management. All aspects of the MATADOR proposal and model design that may become known to the contractor shall be considered proprietary and shall not be divulged to anyone outside of the designated proposal / test team. An award of this work is subject to the availability of funds and will be no earlier than February 1, 2005.  B.	SCOPE The work involves lifting the Mars airplane prototype payload into the stratosphere and releasing it. The payload will be the MATADOR aircraft, 733, provided by NASA. Size, mass, configuration, performance and altitude data is provided below. Views of the payload are provided in Figure 1. During at least one flight, the wingtips will be folded prior to launch and unfolded in-flight. In all flights, the airplane will be lifted in a horizontal attitude and released. In the early stages of the flight, an Attitude Control System (ACS) will keep the airplane stable until it achieves flight airspeed of approximately 200 m/s (450 mph). A main rocket will provide the necessary flight speed. After achieving flight speed, the airplane will perform a simulated deep stall landing, at an  altitude of approximately 31 km (101,000 ft), using the ACS. The main rocket and thrusters will use Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2) as fuel. Fuel system pressures will be less than 600 psi. Handling of the fueled airplane payload shall be only be by personnel designated by NASA. Following the simulated landing the aircraft will use GPS navigation to fly within a safe area. After the aircraft descends to 6000 m (20,000 ft), a transition towards the primary recovery area will be preformed. After the aircraft reaches an altitude of approximately 700 m (2,000 ft.) it will be flown manually by a NASA pilot to a landing. The primary recovery area shall be adjacent to the launch area. The airplane will have primary command, control and telemetry uplink/downlink capability in the 900 Mhz Radio Frequency (RF) band.  Primary tracking information will be included in the telemetry stream. Avionics necessary to control the model and data handling systems will be provided by NRL. C.	TRACKING , RECORDING  AND PUBLIC OUTREACH A secondary  tracking downlink shall be provided by the contractor to allow tracking of the airplane from the ground or from a chase aircraft, independently from NASA’s primary tracking system. Video downlink and image acquisition from the airplane payload and the balloon shall also be provided by the contractor. Data from the secondary tracking and video systems, as described in Tasks 6 and 7, shall be used by NASA and the contractor for monitoring the flight and reporting progress to the FAA and cognizant military command reporting purposes. The tracking and video data will also be used by NASA for Public outreach and educational purposes. NASA will use the output from the secondary tracking system in order to publish real-time tracking information on the world wide web (internet) via an RF to Internet “gateway” (I-GATE) provided by NASA. Video feeds from the airplane and the balloon shall be available for NASA documentation. NASA will use video imagery from the airplane and the balloon on a delayed basis in order to provide information to the public regarding the flight.  The contractor’s work also includes flight train integration, range safety, airspace clearances, video image acquisition, weather constraint definition and activities necessary to track the balloon and release the airplane.  Should the model deviate from its planned flight path, OPTIONAL, SPEARATELY PRICED, search and recovery services in the form of aircraft and personnel may be required. D.	INTENDED USE The data obtained from the HAFTs will be used to provide critical technology development / risk reduction input into future Mars exploration missions that use unmanned airplanes. E.

IR1052-01-001 ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER (EFT) PAYMENTS - 

Effective May 1, 2002, in order to receive payments under this contract/award, contractors are required to register in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.  Beginning October 1, 2002, CCR will be the primary database used to obtain contractor information for all Federal Government contracts. Contractors can complete the on-line CCR registration process by accessing http://www.ccr.gov.  Annual renewal of a contractor's registration is a requirement.  There are mandatory fields in CCR that need to be completed before the registration can become active.  For example, contractor business, name, address, telephone, point of contact, business start date, Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number (plus 4 digits, if applicable), Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) and the Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) account numbers to permit receipt of electronic payments, are all mandatory fields.  Registration via the internet can generally be activated within 48 hours, if all the information is complete and accurate.  Registration via another method can take up to 30 days.

The CCR web site contains information and a telephone number (800-333-0505) where a contractor can call to get an expedited DUNS number, in order to start the registration process. Contractors must obtain the EFT account numbers from its own financial institution, if not already known.  Contractors will be ineligible for awards, if they are not registered in CCR, unless they meet an exception or apply for a waiver.  Contractors requesting a waiver from CCR registration must apply via the Contracting Officer.  Only the Bureau Chief Procurement Officer (BCPO) can approve a waiver from CCR registration and permit the award action, if the contractor is not registered in CCR. Any contractor meeting an exception or obtaining a waiver from CCR registration is still required to get an EFT account in order to receive electronic payments, in accordance with the Debt Collection Improvement Act.  Contractors shall then submit a completed Automated Clearing House (ACH) Vendor/Miscellaneous Payment Enrollment Form (formerly SF 3881) directly to:
Internal Revenue Service
Office of Financial Applications Support and Technology
P. O. Box 3339,
Cincinnati, Ohio 45201-3339
Or Fax to:  (513) 263-5020

The ACH Vendor/Miscellaneous Payment Enrollment Form can be obtained from the IRS Contracting Officer or from the IRS Office of Financial Applications Support and Technology, points of contact, Joan Aker or Nancy Estep at (513) 263-5069/5055, if not included in this solicitation/award.

In order for contractor invoices to be determined proper and payments made under applicable awards, contractor EFT information must be valid and current.  Valid contractor EFT information must include the Agency information; the Payee/Company information including Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN); and the Contractor's financial institution information, including the nine-digit routing transit number, account type and account number.  If the contractor is registered in CCR, changes can be made to its business profile at any time.  Under this award, if any changes are made to the mandatory business information in CCR, the contractor is required to notify the IRS Beckley Finance Office within three (3) business days.  Under this award, those contractors not registered in CCR but enrolled in EFT payments, are also required to report any changes to their business information to the IRS Beckley Finance Office within three (3) business days.  Contractors can e-mail notification of their changed CCR and EFT business information directly to: CFOBFC.CCRPaymentinformation@irs.gov

Valid contractor EFT payment information is required in order for the Government to make any payment under this award. Invoices received prior to the receipt of valid EFT information shall be deemed improper for the purpose of prompt payment under this award and payments will be rejected or suspended.  Contractors may only request a waiver from EFT payments if they meet one of the criteria listed on the Request for Waiver of Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) Payment Form.  The waiver request form can be obtained via the Contracting Officer or the IRS Office of Financial Applications Support and Technology at telephone (513) 263-5069/5055 or e-mail Nancy.V.Estep@irs.gov or Joan.Aker@irs.gov.  Waivers from EFT Payments are only granted by the IRS Office of Financial Applications Support and Technology and contractors must obtain the waiver from EFT payments, prior to award being made. 
-------------
 IR1052-01-002 PAID SYSTEM  

Access On-line Payment Information.  The U. S. Department of Treasury, Financial Management's Payment Advice Internet Delivery (PAID) system provides contractors with invoice payment information included with an Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) payment made via the Automated Clearing House (ACH) payment system.  PAID is free to contractors with Internet access.  Registration for the PAID system can be done on-line at http://fms.treas.gov/paid/ (Note: no "www").  Register using your Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) and then select a user ID, password, and a specific method of delivery.   The PAID webmaster will verify your registration and notify you that your access has been activated within five (5) business days and confirm your acceptance by e-mail.

Access is limited to your payment data and the information is available for 60 days beginning the day after your account has been activated.   If you have any questions about payment  information found on PAID, contact IRS, Beckley Finance Center at (304) 256-6000.  

 
--------COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 508 OF THE REHABILITATION ACT OF 1973
  
All equipment and services must comply with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as explained below.   Information pertaining to Section 508, and accessibility standards checklists to determine if items are compliant, can be found at either of the websites listed after this paragraph.   To comply with the requirement to provide a list of compliant equipment, vendors may combine that list with the price list requested in instructions for submitting your quote. -----

http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/508standards.htm
http://irap.no.irs.gov/508/testing.asphttp://irap.no.irs.gov/508/testing.asp----
 		
Section 508 Compliance

The Contractor must provide a comprehensive specific list of all offered electronic and information technology (EIT) products (supplies and services) that fully comply with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, per the 1998 Amendments, and the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board's Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Standards at 36 CFR Part 1194.  The Contractor must clearly indicate where this list with full details of compliance can be found (e.g., vendor's or other exact web page location).  The contractor must ensure that the list is easily accessible by typical users beginning five calendar days after award.  The contractor must maintain this detailed listing of compliant products for the full contract term, including all forms of extensions, and must ensure that it is current within three calendar days of changes to his product line.                                                                 
The offeror must ensure that all EIT products that are less than fully compliant are offered pursuant to extensive market research, which ensures that they are the most compliant products and services available to satisfy this solicitation's requirements.                  

For every EIT product accepted under this contract by the Government that does not comply with 36 CFR Part 1194, the contractor shall on 30 days notice, at the discretion of the Government, make every effort to replace or upgrade it with a compliant equivalent product or service, if commercially available and cost neutral.

The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) has a need for contractor support in its Middle East/North Africa/South Asia (ME/NA/SA) region.  The ME/NA/SA region requires the assistance of a project analyst to support the Region’s program development and the management and administration of ongoing program activities in the region.  The deliverable for this contract is a series of interim reports/documentation and a final report that summarizes the research, activities and recommendations mentioned below.  A key component of the reports will be recommendations that enable the Regional staff to effectively manage projects and make determinations for follow-up activities, as appropriate, for existing projects in the portfolio.  The objective is to provide day-to-day support needed by the region to successfully perform its ongoing program operations.  The Project Analyst would primarily assist in:

C.1.1	Assisting staff with project management and oversight of ongoing activities;

C.1.2 		Performing research on economic and market trends in the ME/NA/SA Region;

C.1.3	Supporting preparation of project and agency documentation, including:

C.1.8	 Provide deliverables, including a series of interim reports/documentation and a final report that summarizes the above research, activities and recommendations.


C.2	Deliverables	

The deliverables under this contract may take the form of information, advice, opinions, alternatives, analysis, evaluations, recommendations, reports, other oral or written work products, and day-to-day support needed for the successful performance of ongoing federal operations.

C.2.1.               Oral updates to the ME/NA/SA region staff regarding the assigned projects;

C.2.2.	Written reports and memoranda related to assignments, as described above;

C.2.3.	At the conclusion of the assignment, the Project Analyst will prepare a report that provides recommendations on the management of ongoing projects in the ME/NA/SA region.  The report will reflect the results of the tasks of project management and oversight of ongoing activities and may address issues such as kickoff meetings, post study briefings, invoicing procedures, grantee follow up, interim reporting, and preparations for post study evaluations.
M.3	Evaluation Factors

M.3.1		Relevant Education and Experience – 50 Points

Presentation of how education and prior experience relates to the scope of work as outlined in Section C.

The Government reserves the right to make cost/technical trade-offs that are in the best interest and to the advantage of the Government.
