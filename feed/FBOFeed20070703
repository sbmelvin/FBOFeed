<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration intends to award a purchase order on a sole source non-competitive basis to Millipore Corporation, 290 Concord Rd., Billerica, MA 01821-7037.  Item 0001, Catalog number: RMMXRP110, Microstar upgrade to Milliflex Rapid Package, Item 0002, MXRPLTVP1, Validation Protocol for Milliflex Rapid, Item 0003, MXRPBLRST, Milliflex Rapid Standard Reagent (France), Item 0004, MXRPCLKT1, Milliflex Rapid Cleaning Kit, Item 0005, RMHVMFX24, MFX For Microstar 0.45 um membrane, Item 0006, RSINSTL11, Rapid Micro Product Installation at Customer-Standard, Item 0007, RSVATVL11, Rapid Micro Travel Fees for Validation services, Item 0008, RSVALID12, Rapid Micro On-site Validation Services (Consultancy/PQ) on-site, Item 0009, RSSEMIN11, Rapid Micro Services- PMT seminar on-site, Item 0010, RSPMMXR12, Milliflex Rapid Premium Maintenance Contract on-site.  

This is an upgrade of an older Milliflex Rapid Sterility Detection System currently in use.  The Milliflex Rapid Detection System is a microbal detection system which utilizes combination of 3 technologies (membrane filtration, ATP Bioluminescence and CCD) to detect and record the signals of viable organisms in culture.  The combination of these technologies also enables the enumeration of viable micro-organisms on the surface of Durapore membrane filters.  The ATP Biolumenscence assay allows for detection and enumeration of viable microorganisms via a light signal in a shortened period of time as compared to conventional sterility tests.

This unit was originally selected because it is the only instrument currently available that utilizes the combination of technologies that permit detection and enumeration of viable contaminants in biological products.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTES.  However, sources may submit descriptive literature, fully documenting their capabilities, which will be considered by the agency.  A determination to compete this procurement based on response(s) to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The FDA intends to make an award immediately after the response date of this notice.  The award will be made in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.

SafeNet allows access tot he Department of State when accessing the servers from remote locations.

<DESC>The Federal Acquisition Service of the General Services Administration (GSA) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to implement a Local Services Acquisition (LSA) for Telecommunications Services.  The Government will award a series of Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts, with a base period of three years and four (4) twelve month option periods.  Firm Fixed Price task orders will be issued under the resultant IDIQ contract.  The Government plans to award multiple LSA contracts in the states of Maryland, Virginia, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Delaware.  These contracts will be for the use of all Federal agencies, authorized Federal contractors, agency-sponsored universities and laboratories and, as authorized by law or regulation, state, local, and tribal Governments, and other organizations.  The Government has defined three service groups: Voice Services (VS), Data Transmission Services (DTS) and Internet Access Services (IAS), along with the labor and material necessary to connect these services to customer premises equipment (CPE).  Offerors must propose mandatory voice services to be eligible for an award.

The Government desires to make multiple awards for LSA services but reserves the right to limit the number of awards.  Contracts will be awarded to Offerors whose proposals are most advantageous to the Government.  The actual number of contracts awarded will be determined by the Government and based on technical acceptability and price evaluation of mandatory LSA services.  The following Technical factors will be considered: Technical Approach, Past Performance, and Management Approach.  The Technical Factors of Technical Approach and Past Performance will be approximately equal in weight and each will be greater in weight than the Management Approach factor.  The combined weight of all technical evaluation factors will be approximately equal to the Price Factor of Total Evaluated Discounted Cost.  Competitive formal source selection procedures will be used as set forth in FAR Part 15.  Offerors are advised that an award may be made without discussion or any contact concerning the proposals received.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; and to award contracts to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total evaluated discounted cost.  Therefore, proposals should be initially submitted on the most favorable terms.

The Request for Proposal (RFP), consisting of the solicitation and all attachments will be issued and posted electronically on the www.fedbizoppps.gov website.  Any questions regarding this synopsis should be directed to Kristin L. Markiewicz, GSA Contract Specialist, at Kristin.Markiewicz@gsa.gov.  This procurement is being conducted under full and open competition on an unrestricted basis under NAICS Code 517110.  The solicitation should be available on or about 07/23/2007.  Potential offerors should be advised that the date of a pre-proposal conference will be announced at the same time as the issuance of the RFP and is estimated to be conducted approximately two weeks after the official RFP is posted.

<DESC>The Government intends to negotiate a Firm Fixed prices type contract with Time and Material provisions for services (including labor) for the development of a threat evaluation software system to improve maritime domain awareness in a selected Area of Responsibility (AOR) as required by the Commander Navy Europe/Commander Sixth Fleet, Naples, Italy.  This is a 100% Small Business set aside under North American Industry Classification System code (NAICS) 541511.

The means of achieving this goal under contract will be to apply a COMPUTER ASSISTED MARITIME THREAT EVALUATION SYSTEM software program, fully compatible and interfaced with maritime detection data inputted from deployed equipment, tools, instruments, or other data sources, and authorized to operate in a military or a coalition network environment (classified or non-classified). The contractor shall provide a computer based threat evaluation system together with any other complementary, associated, supporting or bundled programs that will analyze ocean going cargo vessels for security implications in support of comprehensive maritime domain awareness efforts. The system shall allow for utilization of business rules developed in collaboration with coalition/Alliance partners, be approved by the US Navy and access external data to allow accurate, in depth and reliable threat evaluation and analysis, realistic and practical recommendations for interdiction, boarding or other appropriate action. Features shall include: Automatic data stream to identify and geolocate vessels; allow specification of parameters controlling which vessels to evaluate i.e. (geographic bounds, flag state, vessel type or size etc.); allow for access to external data to discover vessel, crew, cargo and voyage data; allow user developed threat evaluation rules and scoring to be applied to data automatically; shall display an operational picture with indications of threat status for all vessels based on a logical combination of scores derived from the application of each threat evaluation rule; and allow drill-down to display logic behind the threat status for each vessel. EXAMINATION OF SOURCE SELECTION PLAN Offerors are invited to examine the Navy?s Source Selection Plan (SSP), located at <http://www.fedbizops.gov>.  It is not unusual for an SSP to contain some matters not specifically described in the solicitation, and vice versa.  For instance, the SSP will often identify the evaluation weighting scheme in greater detail, and may include the forms used by the Technical Evaluation Board in reviewing proposals. Despite these variations, both documents are intended to operate in harmony.  If any Offeror discovers an actual conflict between the provisions of the SSP and the Solicitation, this matter must be brought to the attention of the Contracting Officer before the proposal submission date.  Please keep in mind that a conflict involves provisions that are inconsistent or mutually exclusive, not merely containing more detailed or additional information.  In the event that the SSP and the solicitation are in direct conflict, the provisions of the solicitation will apply, except for those matters referenced in the SSP that may be mandated by law or regulation.  

N.B.: If the Offeror cannot access the SSP from the address provided above, immediately contact the Contracting Officer or the Governments designated representative identified in. The proposed request for proposals (RFP) N00189-07-R-0032 will be posted on or before 12 July 2007 with a response date of 30 days thereafter. Potential offerors are hereby notified that the solicitation and subsequent amendments to the solicitation will only be available by downloading the documents at http://www.neco.navy.mil or at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  This office no longer issues hardcopy solicitations.  

The Contracting Officer reserves the right to conduct verbal or written discussions with respect to other than price with the offerors at anytime prior to award.  By submitting a proposal, the offeror will be self-certifying that neither the requestor nor the principal corporate officials and owners are currently suspended, debarred or otherwise ineligible to receive contracts from any Federal Agency.   Failure to do so may represent grounds for refusing to accept the proposal.  By submission of a proposal, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that the prospective awardee must be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation, except for awards to foreign vendors for work to be performed outside of the United States.  Lack of registration in the CCR database will make the offeror ineligible for award. Offerors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at http://ccr.gov.

<SUBJECT>58--Coastal Battlefield Reconnaissance and Analysis (COBRA)  Production
<SOLNBR>N6133107R0056
<RESPDATE>083007
<ARCHDATE>09292007
<CONTACT>Wanda Cutchin 850-636-6140 , or Contracting Officer Tammy Bair at 850-636-6115.
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City, FL intends to award a sole source firm fixed price contract to Northrop Grumman Corporation, Airborne Ground Surveillance and Battle Management Systems Integrated Systems Division, Melbourne, FL for the full rate production (FRP) quantity of Coastal Battlefield Reconnaissance and Analysis (COBRA) Block I systems.  This is a limited production of the COBRA Block I system because COBRA Block II systems will replace the Block I systems scheduled to start in Fiscal Year 2011. This acquisition is for the production of sixteen (16) COBRA Block I systems.  These sixteen units are for three (3) systems in fiscal year (FY) 08 with a contract option for eleven (11) systems  in FY09 and another option for two (2) systems in FY10.  Delivery will be completed within 14 months after award of the basic contract, 18 months after the exercise of the first option, and 15 months after the exercise of the third option. The Coastal Battlefield!   Reconnaissance and Analysis (COBRA) Block I system is a multi-spectral imaging system that provides the capability to conduct unmanned aerial tactical reconnaissance in the littoral battle space for the detection of unburied minefields, mine lines, obstacles, and fortifications on the beach prior to an amphibious assault. The system will be deployed from the Fire Scout Vertical Takeoff Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (VTUAV).  This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons.     This acquisition implements the U.S. Navys acquisition strategy as documented in the COBRA Single Acquisition Management Plan (SAMP) approved by the Program Executive Office for Littoral and Mine Warfare (PEO (LMW)) on 03 April 2007. The SAMP states that COBRA Block I production quantities will be acquired sole source from the system developer. Northrop Grumman Corporation is and has been the sole developer of the COBRA system since the competitive award of the SD&D p!  hase contract. There have been no other contractual actions related to  the SD&D phase awarded since this contract. Given the complexity of the system and the level of system knowledge required to work through the SD&D it is reasonable to assert that Northrop Grumman is the only source possessing the expertise, internal technical data, equipment, and experienced personnel necessary to successfully produce the systems. This is a follow-on contract for the production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, within the exact meaning of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). Use of any other vendor would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that, given the limited number of systems being acquired, is not expected to be recovered through competition. There are no other possible sources that can satisfy this requirement without significant additional cost, significant schedule risk and significant technical risk to the Government.     The systems will be delivered to the Naval Support Activity - Pa!  nama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018. The NAICS is 334511, Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees, the FSC is 5821. Note 22 applies. Contract Specialist: Wanda Cutchin, Code XPS1, NSWC-PC, 100 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, Fl 32407-7001, email  wanda.cutchin@navy.mil.  NSWC Panama City intends to release the solicitation electronically only on or about 07/30/2007.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWCPC) intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Advance Acoustics Concepts, Inc., 500 N. Water St STE 720, Corpus Christi, TX 78471, for the procurement of Remote Minehunting System (RMS) training.  The NSWCPC requires contractor support for the development of minelike contact recognition training for the remote minehunting system (RMS) equipped with the AN/AQS-20A.  In development of the training, the contractor support is required to provide NSWCPC with six graded lessons in contact recognition that are compatible with the Surface Navy Integrated Undersea Tactical Trainer system already delivered by Advanced Acoustic Concepts.  Advanced Acoustic Concepts are the only providers able to perform the work for several reasons.  This work is similar to software they have already produced for the Navy, and needs full compatibility with previous work.  Additionally, partial funding for the tasking comes from an FY06 cong!  ressional plus up that calls Advanced Acoustic Concepts out specifically as the contractors.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for an Ion Chomatograph in order to perform analytical measurments involving primary cations, anions, and organic acids. NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from Dionex, Inc. because of the firm's use of a patented process called autosuppression, which makes it possible to use higher capacity columns that reduce the potential for overloading and permit a single run determination of a wider concentration range of analytes.  In additon, the Dionex instrument is required because of the exceptional features and most efficient use of operator time. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on July 18, 2007.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation notice of intent for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued for the solicitation number NOI7114 issued as a Notice of Intent.  The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-17.  This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a small business concern.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 561990, which has a size standard of 6.5.  The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to award sole source procurement to Department of Microbiology and Instituto de Ciencias Neurologicas, Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Lima Peru.  This protocol is designed to research the effects of possible treatment of neurocysticercosis.  The objective is to determine if an enhanced treatment regimen of corticosteroids is more effective in controlling seizures in patients with intraparenchymal cysticercosis who receive antiparasitic treatment.  The goal of this is to 1) compare the cumulative frequency of seizures (partial and generalized) on study days 90 and 360 in patients treated with these regimens, 2) compare the proportion of patients free of viable cysts on study day 180 and 360 in patients treated with these regimens, 3) compare the proportion of persistent viable cysts on study day 180 and 360 in patients treated with these regimens, and 4) compare the safety of these regimens in these patients.  The work is to be performed in Peru to understand the pathophysiology of disease in neurocysticercosis.  This is work for a clinical trial study that is an open-label randomized study designed to compare the effectiveness of a short compared to a longer course of corticosteroids employed to suppress antihelminthic treatment induced seizures in neurocysticercosis. Eligible adults with one or more viable intraparenchymal cysts and a history of seizures within the past 6 months are randomized to one of two groups. The first group (Arm 1) is randomized to receive a 14-day course of albendazole and 6 mg dexamethasone for ten days, the same regimen of corticosteroids employed in the above mentioned published trial. The second group (Arm 2) is randomized to receive the same course of albendazole (15 mg/kg albendazole in two divided doses, max 1200 mg day) but enhanced dexamethasone dosing consisting of 4 weeks of 8 mg/day dexamethasone followed by a two week taper. At study day 42, 3 months and 1 year the number of generalized and partial seizures, the proportion of patients with seizures and side effects will be compared between the two arms.  The period of performance will be from the date of award to July 27, 2008.  The proposed contract is for services and related supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and procure with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302.

<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement.
Researchers at PNNL have developed an improved process for the production of proteins and chemicals in fungal bioprocesses. The technology is an improved bioprocess obtained through genetic manipulation of fungal morphology. Fungi are widely utilized for production of a variety of commercially useful products. Most of these bioprocesses for industrial scale production of chemicals and proteins use species of fungi that are characteristically referred to as filamentous fungi. Utilization of a filamentous fungus species for production of desired compounds most often involves growing submerged cultures of the fungus. When these fungi exhibit filamentous growth in submerged culture it results in increased viscosity of the culture medium, thus adversely affecting mass transfer rates and energy input for aeration and mixing. These culture properties are typically associated with decreased productivity. Alternatively, ?filamentous? fungi can exhibit pellet morphology, which provides a lower viscosity, a reduction in the power needed for mixing and aeration of the culture,and increased productivity of the desired product.
Note: THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT. Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than 30 days from the publication date of this notice summarizing the company?s business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity. Companies deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the technology. Such information will require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement. Respondent(s) will be notified of their selection as potential business partners based on initial diligence efforts. Companies to be considered further will be asked to respond to a request for business case/plan within 30 days after the request is sent. The request will contain specific selection criteria,including but not limited to plans for investment in product development, the marketing strategy for penetration into the market, as well as the revenue strategy and projected revenue stream related to this new technology and IP.  Please send letters or emails of interest to the attention of the POC identified within this Notice.

PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement.

Researchers at PNNL have developed a process concept for the use of microorganisms in the production of fuels, chemicals and other products. When applied, the new process would improve the efficiency of ethanol fermentations by genetically engineering ethanol producing organisms, for example yeast. The improved conversion efficiency of ethanol production is based on utilization of a five carbon sugar present in hemicellulose, a ubiquitous component of lignocellulosic biomass. The yield improvement combines utilization of xylose, a product of hemicellulose hydrolysis. PNNL's improved conversion efficiency for sugars to ethanol production involves incorporation of enzymes into a genetically engineered ethanologenic microorganism.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) plans to procure on a sole source basis; one LAS-3000 Multi-Functional Imaging Analysis System with FujiFilm Medical Systems; 419 West Avenue, Stamford, Connecticut 06604. 

This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 ? Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.106-(b) (1) to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.

The salient characteristics apply to the LAS-3000 Multi-Functional Imaging Analysis System: Dimensions: 510 mm wide x 480 mm deep x 900 mm high.
-     allows multi-agent detection in the same unit;
-	EPI-illuminator for fluorescence array of Blue LEDs (460nm), Green LEDs (520nm), Red LEDs (630nm), UV Transilluminator at 312 nm & White light Diffuser;
-	detects chemiluminescence, Fluorescence, Digitization (Coomassie Blue, Silver Stain, Film Documentation);
-	camera utilizes a ?Bright? F 0.85 low distortion lens;
-	LAS-3000 uses the FUJI super CCD detector cooled to -30C;
-	permits binning of pixels for more sensitive applications that require maximum signal to noise ratios;
-	utilizes super CCD technology which provides 3.2 million pixels in a honeycomb configuration for an equivalent 6.3 million pixel resolution;
-	produces a 16 bit image;
-	images produced are over 16,500 levels of grey scale;


Facts and Reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition:

1.	Statutory authority: Statute: 13.106-1(b)

(b) Soliciting from a single source.

(1)	For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization).  

2.	Justification:

The Fuji LAS-3000 is the only multifunctional imaging analysis equipment that allows multi-agent detection in the same unit.  With other units, only one can be detected, requiring the separate purchase of two pieces of equipment which would take up additional lab space.  The Fuji LAS-3000 comes standard with an EPI-illuminator for fluorescence array of Blue LEDs (460nm), Green LEDs (520nm), Red LEDs (630nm), UV Transilluminator at 312 nm & White light Diffuser. The unit is designed to detect chemiluminescence, Fluorescence, Digitization (Coomassie Blue, Silver Stain, Film Documentation).  Given current limitations in lab space, it has been determined that a single unit is the only visable option.  

The Fuji LAS-3000 is required because of the high sensitivity necessary for chemiluminescent analysis.  The Fuji system is the only one that has a camera that utilizes a ?Bright? F 0.85 low distortion lens for much more sensitive light collection.  This lens is unique and provides the highest level of sensitivity for the demands of chemiluminescent detection.  The camera automatically adjusts focus and provides flat frame correction for each of the sample positions.  In addition, the LAS-3000 uses the FUJI super CCD detector cooled to -30C.  This detector is unique in the use of octagonal pixels in a honeycomb configuration.  The Fuji LAS-3000 utilizes super CCD technology which provides 3.2 million pixels in a honeycomb configuration for an equivalent 6.3 million pixel resolution.  As a result, the LAS-3000 is capable of producing the highest sensitivity of any CCD system on the market today.  In addition, the Fuji system permits binning of pixels for more sensitive applications that require maximum signal to noise ratios.  Also, the LAS-3000 CCD produces a 16 bit image.  The images produced are over 16,500 levels of grey scale.

Finally, it is important for continuity of the ongoing research that the procedures be produced on a machine currently being used.  It is vital to these experiments that they maintain the continuity of the collection and analysis of data.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This solicitation is currently available for viewing on the FedBizOps website at www.fbo.gov/.  This procurement is set-aside for total small businesses under NAICS Code 541330 (SIC 8711) with a size standard of $4,500,000.00.  The U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers, Engineer Research and Development Center, proposes to award an indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity (IDIQ) requirements contract.  The total minimum quantity for the base year is 400 hours and the maximum is 20,000 hours.  The total minimum quantity for the option years is 200 hours and the maximum is 20,000 hours.  The minimum and maximum quantities that the government may order on an individual task order are 8 to 800 hours. In this contract the terminology delivery order means task order.  Only work directed by individual task orders issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Vicksburg Consolidated Contracting Office are authorized under this contract. Requirement:  The contractor will be responsible for furnishing pilot services for the simulator. This includes travel costs. The travel costs will be negotiated with each delivery order. The simulation projects will be for a variety of ports and the pilot s for each study must be licensed for the harbor or waterway being studied.  CONCEPT:  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE) is responsible for authorizing and maintaining the nations navigable waterways. Occasionally, the authorized channel must be modified. Usually this is to address a safety issue, or to improve the channel an d allow larger, deeper-drafted ships to call at the port. The COE requires a model study to evaluate nearly all proposed channel modifications. Often the model study involves real-time ship simulation. Real-time means ship movements on the simulator require the same amount of time as they do in real life. Being r eal-time allows professional mariners to operate the simulator as they would a real ship. Usually the simulation work is done on the ERDC Ship/Tow Simulator. The ERDC simulator is shown in Figure 1. However, occasionally ERDC oversees work done at private simulators.  Mariner simulation duties fall into two categories, validation and testing. Validation is the exercise during which the existing condition simulation model is adjusted until real-life conditions are replicated on the simulator. Testing is simulation of bot h proposed and existing conditions. Ship-handlers rely upon local knowledge of navigation conditions to safely maneuver vessels through a waterway. This local knowledge allows them to anticipate a force upon the ship (current, wind, bank effects, etc). If this local knowledge is not incorporated into channel design by having mariners licensed for a project site involved in the simulation exercises, the resulting channel dimensions would most likely be too large to economically dredge and maintain.  Two types of mariners are involved in a deep-draft channel design simulation project. These are ship pilots and docking pilots (sometimes referred to as docking masters). Ship pilots are licensed for particular port and handle all vessel traffic into and o ut of the port. Docking pilots are employed by the tug companies and are in control while the ships are under tug assistance. Docking pilots are typically found only in east coast ports. Ship pilots handle docking duties elsewhere. The simulation duties of all mariners are essentially the same. They are to travel to ERDC or a private facility where ERDC is overseeing simulation modeling and operate the simulator as they would a vessel in real-life. Validation mariners are expected to  make verbal comments upon the accuracy of the simulator and provide input to modifications the engineers make to improve realism. They are to observe the visual scene and radar image, noting that objects are in the proper location and that all necessary o bjects are displayed. They are to note whether or not the vessel model responds to their commands as a real vesse l would. They are to observe environmental conditions in the harbor (current, wind, waves, bank effects, etc) and provide comments as to their realism. Upon completion of the validation effort, the pilots are to complete a short form (one or two pages). Th is form, which will vary from project to project, will document the models realism and additional modifications that should be made prior to testing. This form should be completed prior to the pilots leaving the simulator facility.  Testing program mariners are to operate the simulator during runs of existing and proposed conditions. They are to provide comments as to the safety of the proposed conditions. They are to provide input into changes that could improve the proposed channels . These changes could involve channel widening, placement of aids-to-navigation, or be operational in nature. Their written input and comments will be documented on a short questionnaire to be completed after each simulator run and a final questionnaire to  be completed at the end of their testing session. The final questionnaire is due at ERDC one week after completion of the pilots testing session.  Labor Categories:   A ship pilot shall be licensed by the appropriate State Pilot Board for handling vessels in the project harbor or waterway. Any special requirements for class of license based on ship tonnage will be handled on each Delivery Order. A docking pilot shall be licensed by the appropriate State Pilot Board for handling vessels in specific reaches requiring tug assistance. Any special requirements for class of license based on ship tonnage will be handled on each Delivery Order. A tow captain shall be licensed by the appropriate board for handling the required class of towboat. Any special requirements for class of license will be handled on each Delivery Order.  Ordering Procedures:  After the Vicksburg Consolidated Contracting Office (VCCO) receives a valid requirement for these services the VCCO shall communicate the requirement to the contractor including:  " The particular qualifications required by the task for each labor category included in the order.  " The number of participants needed by labor category.  " The total hours required by labor category for the task.  " The schedule and location of the task.  Once the requirement has been communicated to the contractor the contractor shall provide VCCO with a NOT TO EXCEED (NTE) estimate of specific travel expenses necessary to complete the task in accordance with the paragraph below. If the travel estimate app ears reasonable VCCO will issue the order for the hours required and include a NTE line item for travel expenses. Once the Navigation Branch has accepted the questionnaires or other documentation required by the specific order the task is complete. The con tractor shall then invoice for the hours ordered and for actual travel expenses NTE the amount of the travel line item. Travel Expenses:  Contractor will recruit professionals with specific qualifications and experience from whatever location is the subject of the study specified in the order and arrange for these individuals to travel to a particular study location. Conseq uently, it will be necessary for the contractor to pay and be reimbursed by the Government for travel cost including meals and incidental expenses as provided for in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 31.205-46, Travel Cost. The contractor will invoi ce the Government for actual travel expenses, up to the allowable rates as provided for in FAR 31.205-46 including the regulations that are referenced therein.  Quality Control:  The contractor shall implement a quality control program (QCP) that identifies potential and actual problem areas in providing requirements of the contract as specified and results in corrective action throughout the life of the contract.   A copy must be provided to the Contracting Officer Representative (COR).  Any changes to the QCP  shall be submitted to the COR not later than ten (10) working days prior to effective date of change.  The basic intent of the plan is that the Contractor is responsible for quality. Quality Assurance:  The Contracting Officer Representative (Government employee) will investigate issues and approve services provided under the contract to determine if the Contractor has complied with the performance requirements of this contract (listed  below).  Government inspections will follow FAR 52.212-4. Contract Performance:  The Government will monitor the Contractors performance under this contract using the following deficiency definitions or such other procedures as may be necessary to ascertain Contractor compliance with the contract.   1.  Completion of work after due date is a deficiency. 2.  Provide a sufficient number of qualified personnel which results in the ability to provide the sponsor with an adequate number of simulation tests for analyzing the project design alternatives, etc. 3.  Validation of accuracy of the vessel, environmental, and visual models in ship simulation study. 4.  Evaluate feasibility of safe navigation for proposed future alternatives. 5.  Provide comparative analysis of different proposed alternatives of channel alignments. 6.  Payment will not be made for unsatisfactory performance.  The Contracting Officer and COR will determine whether performance is satisfactory. It is very important that you are registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  If you are not registered in the CCR, an award CANNOT be made to your company.  You may register electronically at http://www.ccr.gov.  Registering electronically will expedite the registration process.

<DESC>Synopsis v 1.3.5 Recently, the US and ROK governments agreed to transition wartime operational command and control (OPCON) of ROK forces to the ROK military in 2012.  This will result in the inactivation of the current U.S. led Combined Forces Command, and the establishmen t of a U.S. complementary supporting joint command in Korea.  This will be a challenging transition for both the U.S. and ROK from organizational structures and ways of doing business that have been practiced in Korea for decades.  This requires a qualifie d team with experience in joint transformational issues.    This transformation team shall be expected to maintain an appropriate presence forward in Korea working day to day to help determine and, as necessary, implement solutions for USFK transformation issues for or with USFK primary staff and their designated r epresentatives. This team will use USFKs Organizational and Operational Concept Plan; Transformation Master Plan; and our Training and Exercise Objectives, Tasks, and Milestones to support USFKs incremental transformation between FY 2008 and FY 2012.  Accordingly, this team shall be required to thoroughly understand these documents and their impact on our overall transformation effort; recommend updates to them as appropriate; and provide continuity throughout the transformation period. This teams responsibilities shall include continuous review and recommended refinements to the above base documents; preparing measurable training and exercise products, assessing training and exercises; preparing and leading transformation training and e xercise after action reports; leading joint tactical discussions; and working side-by-side with USFK Action Officers and appropriate J Staff to ensure all transformation training and exercise requirements and deadlines are met.   This team will continuously keep USFK leadership apprised of transformation progress to include recommended adaptations to ensure all USFK Transformation requirements are met by FY 2012.

Findings generated may lead to non-toxic methods to treat BKD in salmon, without the use of antibiotics.

<DESC>The purpose of this project is to replace a deficient trail bridge across palisades creek with a premanufactured steel truss bridge.  Work will consist of constructing bridge, bridge abutments and backfill/approach grade.   Trail work will be done by others. 

	Located approximately 6 miles up forest trail 084, trail 112 begins at the crossing of palisades creek.  The Forest Service plans on relocating the crossing location downstream approximately 200 feet.  At this location the hillside meets the flood plain.  Across the stream from this location is an elevated bench that tapers down to stream level.  The design length of the bridge is 60 ft.  Excavation to set the abutments and place fill behind to bring up to grade will be necessary.  Access to the site is by non-motorized trail.  It is anticipated that the bridge will be delivered to the site via helicopter in one piece and other material packed in by horse or helicopter.  Motorized vehicles are not allowed in the area, however such equipment as generators, compressors and jumping jack style compactors will be permitted.  The Forest Service will locate material borrow source(s) prior to construction.

<DESC>UPDATE (3 JUL 07): SOLICITATION HAS BEEN POSTED Project Number 040006: Install Steam Lines Area B, MH S-227 to S-173A  (Base) Project Number 040006: Rock Excavation (Option I) Project Number 960082-2: Replace Steam Lines Facility 20027 to S-227  (Option II) Project Number 061989: Replace Steam Lines Facility 20770 to S-202 (Option  III) Project Number 061989: Rock Excavation (Option IV) Solicitation Number FA8601-07-R-0042. The scope of this project consists of furnishing all materials and  performing all labor required to install steam lines in Area B, MH S-227  to S-173A, to included excavation of approximately 1500 cubic yards of  hard material (Project 040006); replace steam lines from facility 20027 to  S-227 (Proejct 960082-2); and replace steam lines from Facility 20770 to  S-202, to include excavation of approximately 140 cubic yards of hard  material (Project 061989).  The scope will also include associated  architectural, mechanical, plumbing, electrical, and miscellaneous work as  shown on the project drawings and described in the specifications.  The  estimated price range is between $1M and $5M.  The NAICS Code is 238220.  The size standard is $13M.  This is an UNRESTRICTED procurement in  accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program  Act of 1988, Public Law 100-656 (15 U.S.C. 644 note). In accordance with DFARS 252.204-7004, contractors must be registered in  the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) prior to award of solicitations  issued after 31 May 1998.  Registration may be accomplished at  http://www.ccr.gov, or telephone at 1-888-CCR-2423.  Every solicitation  issued after 31 May 1998 must include the clause at DFARS 252.204-7004,  "Required Central Contractor Registration. SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS/CONCERNS: A mechanical contractor with experience in  installing Steam/HTHW piping, valves, expansion joints is required.  The  work also includes excavation, concrete/asphalt pavement, electrical work,  and plumbing.  Project 061989 must be accomplished during the non-heating  season and Projects 040006 and 9600822 must be accomplished during the  heating season.  Projects 061989 and 9600822 can't be worked concurrently.  This is a relatively short work performance window for a contract with  multiple critical tasks that must be completed in order for the heating  system to be fully operational in time for the heating season.  It is  vital that the steam/heat to the affected facilities be available at the  start of the winter season.  Over half of the facilities in Area B will be  impacted, to include AFIT, Material Labs, Bio-Medical Center, Computer  Center, and the Avionics laboratories.  A highly experienced mechanical  contractor with extensive experience in steam piping is required because  no time extensions can be given to repair this critical utility system. NOTES: (1) The solicitation will be available on the website on or about 3 July  07, at http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil.  The specifications and drawings will  be posted along with the synopsis.  Documents posted prior to solicitation  release are for informational purposes only. (2) Hard copies of the solicitation will NOT be provided.  However, you  may download and print the file from the website. (3) There is no fee for this solicitation. (4) A hard copy of the solicitation will be available for review at Dayton  Builders Exchange, Minority Contractor Business Assistance Program, and  F.W. Dodge Division in Dayton, OH. (5) A registration page will be attached to the website.  You are not  required to register.  However, when you register you will receive notice  of any amendments and/or addendums that may be issued to the solicitation.  If you have not registered, it will be your responsibility to check the  website for any changes to the solicitation. (6) Contractors shall be capable of securing bonding for the total  proposed amount (base plus options).  However, contractors shall only be  responsible for providing bonding for the base amount plus the amount of  any/all options exercised at the time of award.  If an option is exercised  after award, contractors shall be responsible for securing the additional  bonding equal to the amount of the option. (7) You shall provide a signed copy of the SF 1442 by the proposal closing  date specified in the solicitation.  There will not be a public bid  opening. (8) Contractors that are Debarred, Suspended, or Proposed for Debarment  are excluded from receiving contracts.  Agencies also shall not consent to  subcontract with such contractors.  Proposals prepared by Debarred,  Suspended, or otherwise ineligible contractors are at the risk and expense  of the contractor.

<DESC>The Government intends to negotiate a Firm Fixed prices type contract with Time and Material provisions for services (including labor) for the development of a threat evaluation software system to improve maritime domain awareness in a selected Area of Responsibility (AOR) as required by the Commander Navy Europe/Commander Sixth Fleet, Naples, Italy.  This is a 100% Small Business set aside under North American Industry Classification System code (NAICS) 541511.

The means of achieving this goal under contract will be to apply a COMPUTER ASSISTED MARITIME THREAT EVALUATION SYSTEM software program, fully compatible and interfaced with maritime detection data inputted from deployed equipment, tools, instruments, or other data sources, and authorized to operate in a military or a coalition network environment (classified or non-classified). The contractor shall provide a computer based threat evaluation system together with any other complementary, associated, supporting or bundled programs that will analyze ocean going cargo vessels for security implications in support of comprehensive maritime domain awareness efforts. The system shall allow for utilization of business rules developed in collaboration with coalition/Alliance partners, be approved by the US Navy and access external data to allow accurate, in depth and reliable threat evaluation and analysis, realistic and practical recommendations for interdiction, boarding or other appropriate action. Features shall include: Automatic data stream to identify and geolocate vessels; allow specification of parameters controlling which vessels to evaluate i.e. (geographic bounds, flag state, vessel type or size etc.); allow for access to external data to discover vessel, crew, cargo and voyage data; allow user developed threat evaluation rules and scoring to be applied to data automatically; shall display an operational picture with indications of threat status for all vessels based on a logical combination of scores derived from the application of each threat evaluation rule; and allow drill-down to display logic behind the threat status for each vessel. EXAMINATION OF SOURCE SELECTION PLAN: Offerors are invited to examine the Source Selection Plan (SSP) which will be available for review and posted as a separate document upon release of the solicitation. The SSP will be located at http://www.fedbizops.gov.  It is not unusual for an SSP to contain some matters not specifically described in the solicitation, and vice versa.  For instance, the SSP will often identify the evaluation weighting scheme in greater detail, and may include the forms used by the Technical Evaluation Board in reviewing proposals. Despite these variations, both documents are intended to operate in harmony.  If any Offeror discovers an actual conflict between the provisions of the SSP and the Solicitation, this matter must be brought to the attention of the Contracting Officer before the proposal submission date.  Please keep in mind that a conflict involves provisions that are inconsistent or mutually exclusive, not merely containing more detailed or additional information.  In the event that the SSP and the solicitation are in direct conflict, the provisions of the solicitation will apply, except for those matters referenced in the SSP that may be mandated by law or regulation.  

N.B.: If the Offeror cannot access the SSP from the address provided above, immediately contact the Contracting Officer or the Governments designated representative identified in. The proposed request for proposals (RFP) N00189-07-R-0032 will be posted on or before 12 July 2007 with a response date of 30 days thereafter. Potential offerors are hereby notified that the solicitation and subsequent amendments to the solicitation will only be available by downloading the documents at http://www.neco.navy.mil or at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  This office no longer issues hardcopy solicitations.  

The Contracting Officer reserves the right to conduct verbal or written discussions with respect to other than price with the offerors at anytime prior to award.  By submitting a proposal, the offeror will be self-certifying that neither the requestor nor the principal corporate officials and owners are currently suspended, debarred or otherwise ineligible to receive contracts from any Federal Agency.   Failure to do so may represent grounds for refusing to accept the proposal.  By submission of a proposal, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that the prospective awardee must be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation, except for awards to foreign vendors for work to be performed outside of the United States.  Lack of registration in the CCR database will make the offeror ineligible for award. Offerors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at http://ccr.gov.

<DESC>Amendment is posted to provide delivery instructions inadvertently left out of the RFP.  See solicitation amendment posted 7/3/07.

The Department of State (DOS) has a current requirement for telecommunications cable system design, installation and testing services. We anticipate awarding four  IDIQ (Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity) contracts .  Each contract will have a 12-month base year plus four 12-month Options. The contract ceiling is $2M per contract over 5 years.  Estimated  performance start date is June 2007.

The delivery orders will usually be for testing installed telecommunications cables systems at US Embassies and other diplomatic posts around the world but may require design and installation of systems at overseas posts on an infrequent basis.  The offer must be able to provide a Registered Communications Distribution Designer (RCDD) Archetect, A RCDD engineer and experienced Senior and Junior technicians.

This is a 100% small business set-aside.  The NAICS code is 541380 and the small business size standard is $11M.

In order to be considered for award of this contract, interested offerors, including all entities which comprise a joint venture, and the joint venture itself, must possess a Defense Security Service (DSS) Final Secret, Interim Top Secret or Final Top Secret facility clearance (FCL) with Secret safeguarding capability, issued in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), DoD 5220.22-M. At least two contracts will be awarded to firms currently possessing Interim or Final Top Secret FCLs, while firms with Final Secret FCLs may be selected for one or more additional awards.  Offerors must submit their appropriate Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code with the required qualification documentation.
Selected firms possessing a Final Secret FCL will be sponsored by Department of State for an FCL upgrade to the Top Secret level. Sponsorship does not guarantee that the firm will receive the upgraded clearance. A period of 90 days from the date of selection for award will be allowed for the Secret cleared firm to obtain an Interim Top Secret FCL.  After this period, the Government may, at its discretion, consider not awarding the contract to the selected offeror.
Due to time constraints, the Government will not delay award of contracts to selected firms already in possession of Interim and Final Top Secret FCLs.  Contractor personnel requiring access to classified information or Controlled Access Areas (CAA) must possess Secret or Top Secret personnel security clearances issued by DSS prior to performance on the contract.

<CONTACT>Marivic Hantid Procurement Technician 5038086230     Marivic_Hantid@blm.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management proposes to negotiate a noncompetitive award of a purchase order with the National Council for Air and Stream Improvement (NCASI) P.O. Box 13318 Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, for the study of forest use by barred owls on BLM's Eugene, Oregon District. Work includes capture and radio-tagging of barred owls, emphasizing locations in proximity to those where spotted owls were radio-tracked from 1998-2003 and to measure detailed habitat conditions in barred owl home ranges, using variable-radius plots. From this information, a discrete-choice resource selection function (RSF) for barred owls will be developed and compared to model variables and their coefficients of a similar RSF to be developed for spotted owls in the same area. A habitat capability map for barred owls will be prepared and compared to a similar map for spotted owls in the same area along with a comparison of home range sizes for the two species. Estimated start work is July 23, 2007, and the performance period is through December 31, 2008.  NCASI is uniquely qualified and is the only contractor known to possess the following qualifications necessary to meet the Bureau's requirements:  1) have specific interest and expertise in the study topic and have the ability to cost share in the study, 2) have obtained support from other public and private forest management entities in the area as study cooperators, 3) have conducted studies in this portion of the Eugene District and associated non-federal lands for over 15 years and 4) have an extensive data set on spotted owl habitat use of the area prior (1998-2003) to increases in barred owl numbers, a competitor of the spotted owl.  Firms which meet the above requirements should submit their qualifications in writing specifically addressing the three criteria described above to the Contracting Officer. All responsible sources who submit a response will be considered. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Responses due no later than July 18, 2007 by 11:59p.m. DST.

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH FOR M240G MACHINEGUN RAPID RELOADER The Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL) is conducting a market research for a device to be utilized to conduct experimentation on devices that permit rapid reloading of the M240G medium machine gun.  SCOPE. The M240G medium machine gun is the primary medium machine gun for the Marine Corps and it is doctrinally employed as a crew-served weapon. However, in the current conflicts, the M240G is often operated by only one Marine, such as in vehicle turrets, guard posts, and other applications. A rapid reloader system that would facilitate the operation of the machine gun by an individual would assist the Marine Corps in its combat missions primarily by reducing the time and difficulty of reloading the ammunition belt into the weapon. This reloading process is even more difficult at night and having a rapid reloader for the machine gun could significantly simplify and speed up this process and thereby provide for more effective use of the weapon. BACKGROUND. MCWL seeks to test and evaluate the utility to the warfighter of a device that will allow the warfighter to rapidly reload the M240G medium machine gun with one hand. The current reloading process requires that when a new ammunition belt is loaded into the weapon, it requires two crew members (gunner and assistant gunner) to open the M240G feedcover, introduce the ammunition belt, close the feedcover and then operate the weapon. A device that would provide one-handed operation to load the M240G could reduce the time, complexity, and numbers of crewmen needed to reload the M240G and make it ready for firing.  TASK DESCRIPTION.      Task One:  Contractor shall provide a lightweight (less than 4 oz) device that allows one handed loading and reloading of the M240G medium machine gun.   Sources capable of fully satisfying the above requirements should submit capability statements/expressions of interest providing the Government the necessary information to determine actual capability via email to Mr. Ira D. Patterson ira.patterson@usmc.mil referencing the following tracking #9045. These should be submitted on or before 16 July 2007. This synopsis should not be considered as a commitment of any kind by the Government.

While it is understood the FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) has highly accurate but human-portable azimuth sensing as critical to the advancement of targeting and engagement capabilities.  Precise location and designation of targets, coupled with precise aiming of weaponry are crucial for success not only in conventional warfare but in asymmetric and urban conflict, particularly as light-armored and dismounted tactics are required.  The key technology for achieving this precision is accurate azimuth and vertical angle sensing by the dismounted spotter and gunner operating under adverse conditions. In order to move forward in the development of this technology, DoD program/project management centers are coordinating their various efforts in order to seek a common solution for a human-portable azimuth and vertical angle measurement (AVAM) device.   This announcement is a call for abstracts from the inertial sensing industry, academia, laboratories, and relevant developers that wish to make known to the DoD their ideas, concepts, technologies, experiences, and recommendations toward realization of a human-portable AVAM device.  Each abstract submitted in response to this request will be for official use only (FOUO) and will not be shared among other submitters. Submitted abstracts shall not contain classified material.  Arrangements can be made for classified material upon request.  Furthermore, an abstract submitted in response to this call shall not be construed as a proposal for future developmental work, but only as a communication of information to the DoD. Based on the contents of the abstracts, submitters may be selected to individually and privately present to a DoD-only audience of program/project managers and engineers at the 2007 Joint Precision Azimuth Sensing Conference (JPASC).  Other JPASC presenters/participants will be excluded from the individual presentations in order to maintain a level of confidentiality with respect to the potentially proprietary information of the presenter.  Again, presentations shall not contain classified material. ABSTRACTS Submitted abstracts are at liberty to discuss some or all of the following issues related to human-portable AVAM technology: - technology solution(s), current and potential - accuracy considerations relevant for targeting and weapon aiming - setup/alignment time - suitability for difficult military environments including dismounted operations and weapon mounting - for applications in both GPS allowed and GPS denied environments - weight/size/power considerations - unit production cost considerations Of particular interest are novel and innovative approaches toward improving the current state-of-the-art.  However, the contents of abstracts should correspond with what the submitters would present at the 2007 JPASC if selected.  For purposes of guiding and focusing discussion, a preliminary list of desirable AVAM performance characteristics or goals follows: Near Term Performance Goals Key Parameter				 Azimuth Accuracy-plus or minus 4 mils PE (see note)	 Vertical Angle Accuracy-plus or minus 2 mils PE (see note) Orientation Angle-Pitch:  plus or minus 500 mils (approx. 30 deg) Bank:  plus or minus 270 mils (approx. 15 deg) Slew Rate-30 degrees per second	 Set up Time-less than 180 seconds		 Operational Temperature-minus 40C to plus 70C		 Shock-40g per 11 ms		 Vibration-MILSTD 810 min integrity Volume-less than or equal to 50 cu in		 Weight-less than or equal to 4.0 lbs	 Power-less than or equal to 10 W	 Average Unit Production-TBD	 Cost at FY07 dollars		 Long Term Performance Goals Key Parameter		 Azimuth Accuracy-plus or minus 1 mil PE (see note) Vertical Angle Accuracy-plus or minus 1 mil PE (see note) Orientation Angle-Pitch:  plus or minus 1511 mils (approx. 85 deg);Bank:  plus or minus 500 mils (approx. 30 deg) Slew Rate-1000 degrees per second Set up Time-less than 1 second Operational Temperature-minus 40C to plus 70C Shock-2000g per 1.5 ms at weapon fire Vibration-MILSTD 810 min integrity Volume-less than or equal to 0.25 cu in Weight-less than or equal to 0.2 lbs Power-less than or equal to 250 mW Average Unit Production-TBD Cost at FY07 dollars	 Note:  PE is defined as the magnitude of a deviation from a statistic that will be exceeded with probability of 0.50, or on half the occasions. For a normal distribution it is 0.6745 times the standard deviation.  Azimuth capability must be achievable between 60 deg N/S Lat. Abstract submissions should be limited to one page in Microsoft Word format.  A single-page cover letter should accompany the abstract.  Submissions must be unclassified.  Submissions will not be shared among the other submitters/participants. The abstract and cover letter should be submitted both electronically as an email attachment and in hard copy form.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health, National Institutes of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases is conducting a market survey to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZone small businesses capable of serving the needs mentioned below. 

This project will be designed to procure, preserve and deliver human liver tissue and cells, suitable for cellular and molecular studies from a variety of end-stage liver diseases to researchers.  These tissue and cells would otherwise be discarded or be unobtainable to most researchers who are not a part of a liver transplant center. It is also designed to make normal liver tissue and cells available for research when such livers are found to be unsuitable for liver transplantation. 
This program will be restructured to provide for the establishment of the infrastructure for procurement and distribution of liver tissues and cells.  Only core services for the procurement and distribution of liver tissues and cells will be freely provided to investigators, while the scientists will be required to reimburse for costs for services outside the core ones.  

Currently, this program has served over 800 investigators in the field of liver research,  providing  1731 liver tissue specimens, and 1070 hepatocytes preparations.  Most of the requests, and therefore most of the specimens, had been normal livers. Most of these normal livers have been obtained from the remaining lobes of livers used for pediatric transplantation in which only the left lobe of the liver was used. Pathologic liver specimens were sent to investigators interested in the following diseases: 
Hemochromatosis; Hepatocellular cancer; Hepatoblastoma; Tyrosinemia; Alcoholic steatosis and cirrhosis; Non Alcoholic steatohepatitis; HCV  hepatitis; HBV  hepatitis  Cirrhosis; Primary biliary cirrhosis; Primary sclerosing cholangitis; Wilson's disease  Biliary Atresia; Autoimmune hepatitis; and Cystic Fibrosis. 
The contractor will be required to: collect whole or partial livers removed from liver transplant recipients at surgery or diseased livers removed from heart-beating cadavers; collect and provide normal liver tissue to investigators; maintain the capacity to retrieve, preserve, prepare cells and deliver available specimens to investigators; develop and maintain a cost-recovery system; coordinate efforts with Tissue Collection Centers; maintain the operation of information storage and management systems; comply with HIPAA standards; maintain a coordinating committee; and adhere to proper safety precautions at the Tissue Collection Centers in harvesting and distributing the human tissue.  

This request is for interested firms with the capability of providing the required services to submit a corporate capability statement along with projected pricing, to assist the Government in determining in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 19.502-2(b) whether or not this procurement will be set-aside for any of the programs described above. The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) code 541710 with a size standard of 500 employees.     All respondents are requested to identify their firm's size and type of business.    

Interested firms responding to this sources sought should adhere to the following:

(a)	Provide a capability statement demonstrating relevant experience, skills and ability to fulfill the Government's requirements for the above. The capability statement should contain enough sufficient detail for the Government to make an informed decision regarding your capabilities, however, the statement should not exceed 10 pages.     

(b)	The capability statement should include references, key personnel, and any teaming arrangements needed to fulfill the requirements.

(c)	All capability statements must be submitted in writing to the address identified in this synopsis on April 24, 2006 no later than 3:00pm eastern standard time. Responses will not be accepted via email or fax.

This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for information solicited.

<DESC>The OCC project requires services to plan, implement, document, submit, monitor, and maintain production control workflows and to serve as the subject matter experts for the methods and tools used to enable the production control function.  Services are also required to maintain the library of production control jobs.
ITS supports the portfolios of two PMOs.  Currently, the production control function supports the portfolio of one program management office the Operations PMO.  The existing baseline of workflows and documentation represents part of the Operations PMO portfolio.  It is anticipated that the production control function will expand to encompass additional items in the Operations PMO portfolio and the entire portfolio of the second PMO, the Supervisions PMO.  As new workflows are added, the Contractor shall a) plan the workflows and write Control-M batch processes and other pertinent scripts to implement the defined workflows; b) develop an Operations Manuals for new workflows; and c) assume responsibility for executing and monitoring the new workflows.  It is estimated that twenty (20) workflows will be added each year.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE TO ASSIST NIST IN COMPLETING MARKET RESEARCH FOR A PROCUREMENT THAT IS PLANNED FOR FY2008. NO SOLICITATION IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE, AND NO UNSOLICITED PROPOSALS WILL BE ENTERTAINED AS A RESULT OF THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE.

The NIST Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the Mathematical and Computational Sciences Division (MCSD) in the Information Technology Laboratory (ITL), seeks information from potential sources with experience and current expertise in publication and marketing of scholarly handbooks (hardcover and potentially soft cover).  It is NIST?s plan to have a mathematics handbook of approximately 1000 pages based on guidelines in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and supplemental agency regulations, policies and procedures to be published and marketed.

The results of this sources sought notice will be analyzed in association with the Digital Library of Mathematical Functions (DLMF) Project. For information about the Project see http://dlmf.nist.gov/. 

ADDITIONAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION:

The DLMF Project aims to prepare a successor to the highly successful Handbook of Mathematical Functions, National Bureau of Standards Applied Mathematics Series 55, 1964, edited by M. Abramowitz and I.A. Stegun. The DLMF Project began in 1999 and has been funded by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the National Science Foundation (NSF). A working group of approximately 12 NIST employees and 50 non-NIST authors and validators are contribute to the Project under the direction of 4 Editors. The Editors are assisted by an uncompensated board of associate editors who were selected due to their research accomplishments.

The DLMF handbook covers an important field of applied mathematics in 37 chapters. Most of these chapters present the essential mathematical properties of special functions, such as Bessel and Legendre functions, together with 2D and 3D color graphics and computational information. Three chapters summarize mathematical topics (algebraic and analytical methods, asymptotic approximations, and numerical methods) that are essential in serious work with special functions.

The style of the DLMF is that of the original Abramowitz and Stegun Handbook, in which coverage is maximized and exposition is minimized. This approach made the original Handbook immensely valuable to practicing researchers in physics, applied mathematics, and other scientific, technological, and engineering disciplines. It also found widespread acceptance among students in mathematics and the sciences. These are the same large group of individuals the DLMF is targeting today.

The impressive success of the original Handbook can be attributed to its vast collection of formulas, which were selected with scientific applications in mind. On the other hand, it has never been revised, and so it is badly out of date with respect to the many developments in the theory, application, and computation of special functions that have occurred over the last 40+ years. For example, half its pages are obsolete tables of numerical values of functions. These were useful mainly for computation by interpolation, a method that has been replaced entirely by the availability of mathematical software.  It is planned that by eliminating tables the DLMF will more than double the number of formulas without exceeding the size of the original Handbook (1045 pages).

In addition to a printed volume, the DLMF project is planning to construct a free public Web site that will be maintained indefinitely by NIST. The Web site will present the same information as the published version, but in HTML and other Web-specific formats, and in addition will include a search engine, interactive visualizations, a formula downloading capability, as well as Web links to reviews, full text of articles, and sources of mathematical software.

OBJECTIVE OF THE FORTHCOMING PROCUREMENT AFTER AN APPROPRIATE ACQUISITION STRATEGY IS ESTABLISHED:

The overall objective is to disseminate the results created by the DLMF Project to scientific professionals and students worldwide in an attractive, reasonably priced, and professionally published print edition. The same results will also be disseminated from a free public Web site constructed and maintained by NIST.

More specifically, the objective of this procurement is to select a publisher who will be granted an exclusive license to (1) print a high-quality long-lasting hardcover edition with the possibility of color on every page; and (2) market the edition(s) worldwide to the target audience.  A typical chapter is available at http://dlmf.nist.gov/GA.pdf.

NIST holds copyright to all DLMF content and, unlike the original Abramowitz and Stegun Handbook, the copyright will remain with NIST, together with custody of the original computer files, source code, and all rights to Web distribution and design.  Camera-ready copies (pdf files) will be available for all editions.

NIST plans to collect reports of errors and revise the Web site and the pdf (or equivalent) files accordingly. The revised files will be made available to the licensee for reprintings. NIST also intends to collect recommendations for added technical content and reserves the right to augment the Web site at any time. At appropriate times, to be negotiated with the licensee, NIST may develop subsequent editions for exclusive distribution by the licensee.

Information about the licensed editions will be displayed on the NIST Web site.

<SUBJECT>F--Management of the Teton Mitigation Areas in eastern Idaho.
<DESC>Sometimes, the construction of Bureau of Reclamation projects and dams necessitates the development of new wildlife habitat areas to mitigate for the loss of existing wildlife habitat.  Following the construction of Reclamation's Teton Dam and Ririe Dam in eastern Idaho in the early 1970s, a search began for suitable lands to replace wildlife areas and big game wintering ranges affected by the dams.  Reclamation, other Federal agencies, and the Idaho Department of Fish and Game (IDFG) worked together to establish two Wildlife Management Areas (WMA) in eastern Idaho.  They are the Tex Creek WMA and the Cartier Slough WMA.  Today, the Tex Creek WMA encompasses more than 31,000 acres and is managed for wildlife, with an emphasis on big game habitat management.  The Cartier Slough WMA is 1,028 acres and is primarily a habitat for waterfowl.  These two wildlife management areas are commonly referred to as the "Teton Mitigation Areas", the "mitigation areas", or the "mitigation lands".  Over 25 years ago IDFG assumed the day-to-day management responsibility for the mitigation areas under an agreement with Reclamation.  That agreement expired on September 30, 2006.  Reclamation requires the continued development, maintenance, study of wildlife, and management of the WMAs to mitigate for the loss of wildlife habitat due to the construction of the Teton Basin Project.  Because IDFG is the responsible agency for wildlife management within the State of Idaho, Reclamation intends to contract on a sole-source basis with IDFG for the continued management of the Teton Mitigation Areas for the next five years.  The estimated value of the contract is $1.03M.  The NAICS code is 924120, Administration of Conservation Programs.  There is no small business size standard for this sector since these services are usually performed by federal and state agencies.  Numbered note 22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>Local Calibration of the MEPDG Using Pavement Management Systems

The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has a requirement to conduct a study to establish a framework for collection and storage of required data for local calibration of the Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG) using Pavement Management Systems (PMS) database. The purpose of the study is to provide the users (States) with a step by step procedure for setting up a system to integrate PMS and other databases required for the MEPDG local calibration using existing pavements, as well as provide recommendations for establishing a system for collecting and electronically storing data for new pavements required for future local calibration. 
         
 COMMERCIAL SOLICITATION
              Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12

 This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in                          accordance with the format in [FAR] Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included herein. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The provisions at FAR 52.212-1 apply. FAR 52.212-4 and 52.212-5 will be included in any award resulting from this notice. Full text for these FAR provisions and clauses may be accessed at http://acquisition.gov/far/index.html. 

            SCOPE
             
            The purpose of this project is to work with one State to establish a framework for collection and storage of required data for local calibration of the MEPDG using PMS database. A portion of this project will require a State to collect and electronically store additional data as required for the MEPDG local calibration. The contractor will verify and confirm that the data was properly collected and stored electronically with a link to the State?s PMS. Existing pavements will be used to complete this project. The final product will provide the users (States) with a step by step procedure for setting up a system to integrate PMS and other databases required for the MEPDG local calibration using existing pavements, as well as providing recommendations for establishing a system for collecting and electronically storing data for new pavements required for future local calibration. This effort will require the contractor to conduct extensive communication and coordination with the State?s pavement management engineer, pavement design engineer, materials engineer, maintenance and traffic monitoring system personnel and information technology (IT) personnel.  

                   
             FIRM FIXED PRICE CONTRACT AWARD
           
            The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed Price contact from this solicitation.               

            EVALUATION CRITERIA
            
The Government?s source selection decision will be based on a Best Value, Trade-off process using the following three factors, further defined below: (A) Technical; (B) Price; (C) Past Performance. When combined, Technical and Past Performance are more important than Price. As differences in technical and past performance ratings and evaluations between offerors proposals become narrower, price will increasingly become more important as a factor. Each of these factors is described below. 

             A.  Technical 

            1.  Technical, Management, and Organizational Capability

?	Knowledge of pavement management systems and pavement design
?	Knowledge of MEPDG
?	Approach to coordinating and managing the calibration effort
?	Experience in working with State DOTs

(b) Capability of organization itself to manage, coordinate, and staff efforts of the type delineated in the SOW, including:
?	Organizational hierarchies and lines of communication.
?	Filling vacancies that may occur related to poor performance, retirement, new Government requirements, and/or normal turnover.
                               2.  Staffing / Qualifications of Key Personnel

	      The relevancy, depth, and breadth of experience and education for proposed       personnel and/or team members and subcontractors, and the extent to which they meet the Government?s needs as specified within this solicitation.        
	 
           B.   Price

           C.  Past Performance 

The Government will evaluate the relevant merits of each offeror?s past performance on the basis of its reputation with its former customers.  The lack of a relevant or recent past performance record will result in a rating of neutral. The Government may review some or all of the following past performance areas:

?	Timeliness;
?	Delivery or Performance;
?	Problem Responsiveness;
?	Quality of Purchased Product or Services;
?	Cost Control; 
?	Technical Support; and
?	Delivered Quantities.

In evaluating Past Performance, the Government may consider information provided by offerors in their proposal submissions, as well as any other information available to the Government.

              Phase I (Tasks)  

This effort will be divided into two phases. Phase I of this SOW will accomplish first. Phase II will be structured as an option. Upon completion of the first phase, the Government, at its sole discretion, may exercise the option to continue with Phase II.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>.  1.  Title :  STATEMENT OF WORK
Payroll Operational Support for Military Sealift Fleet Support Command (MSFSC)
2.  Background. 
The Military Sealift Fleet Support Command (MSFSC) N6 Department is tasked with providing operational support for the payroll system called the Unified Civilian-Mariner (CIVMAR) Payroll System (UCPS).  The UCPS application is a batch-processed COBOL system.  Current configuration has two separate instances supporting two geographically-separated fleets, providing payroll services for approximately 5,000 CIVMARS.
Current payroll production support is being performed by 2 computer operators and 1 lead operator.
The below table is an example of a current typical two-week work period, with coverage on regular 8 hour days from 0700 until 1600:
Week 1		Week 2 (Payroll Week)
S	M	T	W	T	F	S		S	M	T	W	T	F	S
0	8	8	8	8	8	0	Payroll Operator Lead	0	8	8*	8	8	8	0

0	8	8	8	8	8	0	Payroll Operator No. 2	0	8	8#	8	8	8	0
* No. 1: Tues: 0800 ?1700
#No. 2: Tues: 0930 ? 1800
The Contractor adjusts work hours and works interactively with MSFSC payroll personnel to meet payroll production deadlines.
The current contract includes an option for a training/transition period, should the incumbent not be awarded the follow-on.  The training/transition period will cover a period of performance from 1 October 2007 through 15 Jan 2008.
MSFSC N6 is seeking support for our production operations of the UCPS system beginning in October 2007.  While this describes current operations, innovative proposals are solicited to increase operational performance while reducing costs.

The HDTV camcorder must have the ability to record compressed native resolution 1080p video (without filtering) to an on-camera non-perishable format (e.g., tape, flash memory, RAID) with at least 40 minutes of contiguous recording capacity using a high quality video compression method (e.g., H.264, wavelet) with a bit rate of at least 140 Mega bits per second (Mbps).  The HDTV camcorder must have the ability to record at least 4 channels of uncompressed digital AES/EBU broadcast quality audio (48 kHz) synchronous with the recorded video.  The HDTV camcorder must have the ability to accept interchangeable lenses and must include at least one HDTV lens with a minimal zoom range of 18-50 mm (35 mm equivalent) at a maximum f-stop of 2.8.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL
ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION
FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  THE SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF FAR 13.5 TEST PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ITEMS.

***This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-17.***

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 333314 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. This requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quotation.***

***The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase of One (1) Infrared Interferometer.

****All interested Contractor?s shall provide a quote for the following:

Line Item 0001: Quantity One (1) Infrared Interferometer, which shall meet or exceed the following specifications:

1.	The Infrared Interferometer must include a two-port (one for infrared input; the other for infrared output) Michelson interferometer for providing optical-interference-based modulation of an input infrared beam as a scan mirror is moved along the optical axis, and an associated metrology system operating at the HeNe laser wavelength near 632.8 nm for measuring the scan mirror movements.
2.	Infrared sources and detectors do not need to be included.  NIST will be using the Infrared Interferometer with existing source and detector systems upon delivery to NIST. 
3.	The aperture diameter must be such that a 4.1 cm diameter infrared beam having zero divergence (perfectly collimated) must pass through the system with no vignetting, and a 2 cm diameter infrared beam having 150 mrad divergence with pupil at the scan mirror must pass through the system with no vignetting.
4.	The metrology system must not obscure the infrared clear aperture.  Any regions on the beamsplitter or compensator that require coatings for the HeNe laser must be outside of the infrared clear aperture.
5.	The maximum optical path difference between the two arms of the Michelson interferometer, as provided by the motion of the scan mirror, must be at least 2.8 cm.  For collection of double sided, symmetrical interferograms by the end user, the maximum useable optical path difference must be at least 1.1 cm.
6.	The length of the optical path between the input and output infrared ports must be between 5 cm and 30 cm.
7.	The distance between the center of the input port and the surface of the table on which the interferometer sits must be greater than 5 cm but not more than 40 cm.  Similarly, the distance between the center of the output port and the surface of the table on which the interferometer sits must be greater than 5 cm but not more than 40 cm.
8.	At times, NIST will use the interferometer with a single pixel detectors. At other times, the detectors will be infrared focal plane arrays having spatial resolutions of typically 320 pixels x 256 pixels.  The Infrared Interferometer should therefore be capable of maintaining image quality across its aperture.
9.	The modulation efficiency must be greater than 20 percent for all wavelengths in the spectral range of 1.8 micrometers to 2 micrometers, and greater than 25 percent in the spectral range of 2 micrometers to 14 micrometers.  This requirement applies to a ray bundle having an instantaneous field of view (for example, for a single pixel of a focal plane array) of 0.35 mrad.  Here the modulation efficiency is defined as the ratio (expressed as a percent) of the modulation depth to the input power, where the modulation depth is defined as the difference between the maximum power (at a given wavelength) and the minimum power (at the same wavelength) measured at the output port as the interferometer scan mirror is scanned.  This definition includes losses due to absorptance from mirrors, beamsplitters, compensators, windows, or other optics within the interferometer, due to shear, and due to wavefront distortion.  It also includes the beamsplitter reflection loss: for example, the 50 percent loss that would occur for an ideal 50 percent reflecting / 50 percent transmitting Michelson interferometer beamsplitter.  All quotations must include a plot of the modulation efficiency vs. wavelength (or wavenumber) showing the expected performance based upon the design.
10.	The beamsplitter and compensator must be removable and replaceable by the end user to enable possible future upgrades in wavelength coverage and modulation efficiency.
11.	The scan mirror motion must be operable in two modes: step scan and continuous scan.  The end user must be able to switch between these two modes using an RS-232 command.
12.	In continuous scan mode, the mirror must sweep across the entire optical path difference range with a constant sweep rate.  
13.	The sweep rate in continuous scan mode must be re-configurable by the end user using an RS-232 command from less than 0.05 cm per second to greater than 12 cm per second in at least 8 steps of approximately 1 cm per second or finer.
14.	The scan mirror turn-around time in continuous scan mode must be greater than 130 microseconds but less than 30 milliseconds.
15.	A 0 to 5 volt trigger signal must be provided at an output connector of the Infrared Interferometer metrology system that indicates each zero crossing of the HeNe laser fringes, for use in triggering the user?s detector sampling.
16.	The metrology system must be able to determine the relative position of the scan mirror to within a resolution of plus or minus 1.25 nm or better.
17.	In step-scan mode, the scan mirror position must be able to stay fixed at any static optical path difference with a resolution of plus or minus 1.25 nm or better (while the end-user?s detector or camera measures the output infrared beam, for instance).
18.	In step-scan mode, the user must be able to send an RS-232 command to initiate the movement of the scan mirror from its current position to the next position in the sequence of optical path differences.
19.	An RS-232 interface must be implemented that enables automated sending and receiving of all required commands and parameters to and from the interferometer.
20.	All user-selectable RS-232 commands and parameters must be fully described in a written user manual to be delivered along with the hardware. 
21.	An interface drawing or solid model should be provided that will enable the end user to design appropriate input and output coupling optical systems using ray tracing software such as Zemax.  This drawing should include positions and diameters of all optics through which the infrared light encounters in its passages from the input to the output ports.
22.	The Infrared Interferometer must be provided in an enclosure with ports  for infrared input and output, and electrical connectors for RS-232, trigger signal, and power.  The input and output ports must not vignette the infrared beam.
23.	All structural natural frequency resonances of the Infrared Interferometer must be greater than 200 Hz to minimize the effect of external vibration on interferometer performance.
24.	The system must run on 110 VAC at 60 Hz.



Line Item 0002:  Installation and Training:

The Contractor shall provide installation for the Infrared Interferometer.  Installation, at a minimum, shall include uncrating/unpackaging of all equipment, set-up and hook-up of the laser, demonstration of all required specifications, and removal of trash.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for a sample and probe tip nanopositioning components, to be used in a Tip Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (TERS) instrument under development in the Ceramics Division, Electronic and Optoelectronic Materials Group, at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD.

TERS is a form of scanning near field optical microscopy (NSOM) in which a laser beam is focused on the surface of a sample (such as a semiconductor device structure), and, at the same time, a nanoscopic metal probe tip (with tip radius of typically 10 nm to 50 nm) is positioned near the sample surface within the focused laser spot.  The required nanopositioning components comprise two subsystems: (A) ?XY Closed Loop and Z Open Loop Nanopositioning System For Sample?; and (B) ?XY Actuator and Controller for Tip?.

Line Item 0001 ? The contractor shall furnish one (1) each, XY Closed Loop and Z Open Loop Nanopositioning System For Sample:

The component shall meet or exceed the following minimum technical specifications:

(1)  The sample nanopositioner shall provide displacement in a three-dimensional orthogonal coordinate system, referred to as an XYZ system, where X and Y denote motion parallel to the sample surface plane and Z denotes motion normal to the surface plane.

(2)  The full range of displacement shall be at least 80 micron in X and Y, and 30 micron in Z.

(3)  Closed-loop feedback control shall be provided for the X and Y positioning, based either on capacitive distance sensing with sensors directly coupled to the moving platform, or another position sensing mechanism that is demonstrated in quantitative tests or comparisons to provide at least as good accuracy, reproducibility, and immunity to drift and electromagnetic interference.

(2)  The full range of displacement shall be at least 4 micron in each direction (X or Y).

(3)  X and Y positioning shall be open-loop, and shall be controllable by external analog voltage sources (note: the external voltage sources are not part of the requested equipment).

(4)  The sensitivity of the X or Y displacement to the external voltage shall have a value between 0.1 micron/volt and 2 micron/volt; the input impedance presented to the external voltage source shall be 50 kilo-ohm or larger.

(5)  A capability for periodic motion in the X direction at frequencies from DC to at least 35 kHz shall be provided by another actuator element, which is mounted on the other XY actuators  (described in items (B1)-(B4)), and whose motion is independent of the other XY actuators.  This element is denoted the ?X oscillation actuator?.
