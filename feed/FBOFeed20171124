<DESC>The U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit No. 6 (NAMRU-6) in Peru is evaluating the development of an effective prophylactic to control enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) caused diarrhea. Individual vaccine candidates are being evaluated in an established Aotus nancymaae preclinical model of diarrhea. Continued used of the A. nancymaae monkey in these studies is essential for comparative analysis across studies and maintenance of an established model of disease. <br />Background: Non-human primate models of human diarrheal diseases caused by ETEC, Campylobacter and Shigella have been developed at NAMRU6 using A. nancymaae. These models represent a unique asset to test the efficacy of vaccines targeting enteric diseases. To date, candidate vaccines against individual strains of ETEC have been tested in the Aotus non-human primate model. We will now test the protective efficacy of a human anti-ETEC antibody product using the Aotus nancymaae model for diarrhea caused by a CFA/I expressing ETEC strain.
<p>For the completion of these studies, we shall require 39 Aotus Nancymaae (Owl Monkeys) non-human primates. All animals shall be of good health. For the scientific consistency and comparative analysis, the delivered Aotus Nancymaae animals must have an equal gender distribution (in so much as possible) and be at 12 months of age and weighing over &gt;700 grams at the time of the initiation of the study.</p>
<p>Delivery:&nbsp;December 29&nbsp;2017 at NAMRU-6 Facilities in Lima Peru.</p>
<p>If capable sources are not identified through this notice, then NAMRU 6 intends to award a sole source contract under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(i) to The Instituto Veterinario de Investigaciones Tropicales y de Altura (IVITA), Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos in Lima Peru, for the requirements of the collaborative effort with NAMRU-6. <br />The Instituto Veterinario de Investigaciones Tropicales y de Altura (IVITA), Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos maintains a large, closed colony of Aotus nancymae (owl monkeys) which are made available for research purposes. This species is the principal animal research model for several infectious diseases of interest to our unit's mission. This source is selected for the following reasons:<br />1. Known health status and genetic composition of the colony. Animals from wild-caught sources in the Amazon basin, because of their unknown health history and parasite burden, are not desirable for biomedical research. Also, the use of the captive-bred population at IVITA negates any impact of acquisition on wild populations of animals and eliminates the possibility of inadvertently supporting the illicit trade of animals.<br />2. Use of this source eliminates the additional cost and administrative burden required to obtain permits required by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) as the shipment does not cross an international boundary.<br />3. Our institution has used this source for its primate purchases over the past 10 years and a considerable body of our research data is based on the use of this animal source. Changing that source will adversely affect the diarrheal model previously established over the past 10 years through potential changes in incidences of disease, and a changing source will make comparisons with historical data impossible.<br />4. Acquisition within Peru eliminates the transportation stress to the animals associated with extended air travel (relatively short transport by air from Iquitos to Lima). The reduction in transportation associated stress results in decreased requirements for acclimation to the new housing arrangement and greatly reduced rates of stress-induced diarrhea.</p>
<p>This pre-solicitation is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for the requirement. Sources interested in responding to this notice are required to submit a capability statement that includes management and technical data and cost information, in sufficient detail and with convincing evidence that clearly demonstrates the capability to perform the required work. Capability statements shall not exceed 5 (8.5 x 11 inch) pages using a font size no smaller than 10-point. All capability statements received by the due date of this notice will be considered by the Government. A request for documentation or additional information or submissions that only ask questions will not be considered as an affirmative response. A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed with a sole source contract.</p>
<p>Capability statements are due by 08:00 AM Local Time,&nbsp;December 10th, 2017. Capability statements shall be submitted by e-mail ONLY as a Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF attachment to the following address: Javier.b.gil.fn@mail.mil Please use subject line "N44852_BAC180001_39AO".</p>

<p>The U. S. Army CERDEC is soliciting proposals under this BAA for the performance of research, development, design, and testing that directly supports advancement of battlefield technologies in the area of Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT). The aim of this BAA is to discover technical approaches to improve and enhance current and future land warrior capabilities, flexibility, and responsiveness in line with CERDEC's strategic vision for enhancing Warfighter capabilities to operate in a symmetric and unsymmetrical environment.</p>
<p>CERDEC's plan is to support multiple and potentially multiphase efforts that pursue the design, development, integration, and demonstration of critical and enabling technology and system attributes pertaining to PNT. Proposed efforts will primarily be of service and material with aims at resolving technical barriers as identified under PART IV.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that proposals submitted in response to this BAA would range in scope of effort from study/analysis type work with limited data and hardware/software deliverables to larger efforts for component developments, techniques, and demonstrations with breadboard and/or prototype style deliverables. The Government realizes that varying technical/scientific approaches will be employed by potential offerors.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates use of a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) type of contract in connection with this BAA. The Government reserves the right to use a different type of contract. Offerors may propose alternate contract types providing that the alternative is supported in the proposal. Use of alternative contract types, if proposed by the offeror, will be negotiated before award.</p>
<p>To be eligible for award of a contract, all prospective offerors, with the exception of other governments, including state and local government agencies, must meet certain minimum standards pertaining to financial resources, adequacy of accounting systems, ability to comply with performance schedules, prior record of past performance, integrity, organizational structure, experience, operational controls, technical skills, facilities and equipment. For additional information and guidance concerning qualifications and standards for responsibility of prospective contractors, please refer to Part 9 of the FAR.</p>
<p>There are certain post-employment restrictions on former federal officers and employees (Section 207 of Title 18, United States Code).

Format and submission preparation requirements are further explained under PART V. All white papers and full proposals will be reviewed and responded to regardless of its final disposition. Once again, the Government will not be responsible for any costs associated with the preparation and delivery of submissions.&emsp;</p>
<p>PART III<br />SCOPE - RESEARCH INTERESTS</p>
<p>Program Description(s):</p>
<p>The U.S. Army CERDEC CP&amp;I Directorate has the mission of research, design, development, initial acquisition, integration, demonstration, and testing of a variety of experimental, inventory, commercial-off-the-shelf and other electronic Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems for a variety of Army missions.</p>
<p>The goal is to support CERDECs Strategic Thrust for PNT by providing technical and operational capabilities that enables the Soldier to continue their operations in hostile RF and GPS denied environments. Proposed technical approaches may apply to operations both before and after the cessation of hostilities. This announcement emphasizes approaches that address the very different challenges presented by urban fighting and dramatically enhance war fighter capabilities, for example, the ability to interact, maneuver, and operate under a time constrained environment. These changes should generally result in lower casualties, lower collateral damage, and the effective use of combat power.</p>
<p>The specific topics of interest revolve around the research and development of technologies may provide revolutionary improvements to the entire spectrum of PNT.</p>
<p>In order to achieve the capabilities described above, CP&amp;I Directorate will pursue the design, development, integration, and demonstration of critical and enabling technologies and system attributes pertaining to citied areas of interest. Offerors should emphasize radical concepts that may contain high technical risk, but if enabled, would have commensurate high military payoff. The Government is not interested in extensions to existing CERDEC programs or minor improvements to operational capability. Rather, CERDEC is seeking innovative concepts that will provide either an entirely new military capability or will enhance existing capability by orders of magnitude (based on demonstrable relevant metrics).</p>
<p>Offerors should be prepared to support the technical feasibility of their concept or idea, and then be prepared to demonstrate and discuss successive phases leading toward technology development. Offerors should also be prepared to propose a base effort supporting the technical feasibility of their concept or idea, and to propose pre-priced options or subsequent phases that further lead toward technology development. It is envisioned that the effort will have a base period of 12 months and two (2) option periods of 12 months each. Offerors should not propose total efforts exceeding 36 months.&emsp;</p>
<p>PART IV<br />RESEARCH INTEREST</p>
<p><br />RESEARCH INTEREST TOPIC ONE (1)</p>
<p>Research Interest: Pseudolite Systems<br />Division: CERDEC, CP&amp;I Directorate, Positioning, Navigation and Timing Division</p>
<p>Objective: The goal of this effort is to design, develop and demonstrate Global Positioning System (GPS) pseudolite technologies. Projects considered under this solicitation will ultimately provide improved situational awareness and support to mission command and decision enhancing technologies.</p>
<p>Description: CERDEC is interested in near term solutions for pseudolite systems which support and augment GPS signals that can be degraded or denied by either friendly or hostile electronic transmission or by natural obstacles. Pseudolites provide GPS protection and reliability by broadcasting GPS-like signals using terrestrial or near-terrestrial transmitters. In moderately degraded environments, pseudolites aid acquisition of GPS satellite signals. In severely degraded environments, pseudolites can be used as a source for positioning and timing. Pseudolites rely upon GPS signal reception when available for precise and accurate determination of the pseudolite Position, Velocity, and Timing (PVT) information. The Army is interested in specific technologies that could improve the potential effectiveness of pseudolites, such as the following: (1) command and control software with analysis tools to aid in the positioning of pseudolites; (2) command and control data links compatible with Army mission command systems; (3) Pseudolite compatible anti-jam GPS antennas; (4) shaped beam output antennas; (5) conformal antennas; (6) distributed aperture antennas; (7) anti-tamper technologies; (8) high efficiency, fast-response power amplifiers; (9) celestial navigation devices to provide a backup position source; (10) differential GPS corrections that could be sent over the pseudolites; and (11) alternative technologies for providing precise time to the pseudolites.<br />&emsp;</p>
<p><br />RESEARCH INTEREST TOPIC TWO (2)<br /><br />Research Interest: Vehicle Navigation System (VNS) <br />Division: CERDEC, CP&amp;I Directorate, Positioning, Navigation and Timing Division</p>
<p>Objective: The goal of this topic is to develop, design, and demonstrate ground vehicle mounted PNT systems, for the benefit of mission command and decision enhancing technologies for the battlefield.</p>
<p>Description: CERDEC is interested in a near term solution for non-autonomous and autonomous ground vehicle platforms to include a scalable and upgradeable hardware solution that provides PNT information in GPS challenged and denied environments. The VNS design should be configurable to balance minimization of essential components, and therefore overall cost of the system, commensurate with mission and operational functionality. Considerations for VNS designs should allow upgrading to GPS military code (M-code). The VNS should be packaged such that SWAP-C (size, weight, power, and cost) will be minimized and will include interfaces for encryption keying, user interface or display, and connectors for external power, antenna, and multiple electrical interfaces including Ethernet that can route PNT data. The VNS should be compatible with the network timing protocol (NTP), the precise timing protocol (PTP), and be able to take aiding sensors from the vehicle if available to improve its navigation and timing solution.<br />&emsp;</p>
<p><br />RESEARCH INTEREST TOPIC THREE (3)</p>
<p>Research Interest: Inertial Navigation<br />Division: CERDEC, CP&amp;I Directorate, Positioning, Navigation and Timing Division</p>
<p>Objective: The goal of this topic area is to identify, develop, demonstrate and advance inertial navigation technology. The technologies sought will be considered to provide improved situational awareness capabilities and support mission command and decision enhancing technologies for the battlefield and its commanders.</p>
<p>Description: Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) are comprised of Inertial Sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscopes which measure specific forces and angular rates. CERDEC is interested in ideas for inertial sensors and systems targeted for dismounted soldier and vehicle navigation platforms that allow navigation in GPS denied conditions. This includes novel gyroscope and accelerometer sensor designs utilizing the following (but not limited to): Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS), mechanical, optical, and atomic domains that meet the SWaP-C goals for the platforms considered. Also of interest are techniques to improve long term performance, such as the following: calibration sensor self-calibration, velocity updating, and range aiding techniques.</p>
<p><br />&emsp;<br />RESEARCH INTEREST TOPIC FOUR (4)</p>
<p>Research Interest: Positioning<br />Division: CERDEC, CP&amp;I Directorate, Positioning, Navigation and Timing Division</p>
<p>Objective: The goal of this topic area is to identify, develop, demonstrate and advance the state of-the-art with respect to location determination and/or orientation technologies, for the benefit of improved mission command and decision enhancing technologies.</p>
<p>Description: Location determination involves using sources that are external to the platform to establish position information, such as the following: GPS, Multi-Global Navigation Satellite Systems (Multi-GNSS), radio navigation, celestial navigation, terrain matching, Signals of Opportunity (SOP), and radio atmospheric signals. Particular aspects of interest to CERDEC are advanced GPS receiver hardware including but not limited to new RF front end designs, non-traditional RF correlator configurations and designs, novel antenna designs, software defined GPS receivers as well as concepts that address integrity monitoring of the GPS signals themselves or of the GPS navigation solution. This could be done in any of a variety of ways including algorithmically or through hardware techniques. Utilization of GNSS signals is also an area of potential interest, including methods to allow standard GPS receivers to track non GPS signals (i.e., GPS receiver software modifications for tracking Galileo satellites). Also of interest are concepts and proposals which leverage emerging and planned future signals, for example, upgradable to M-Code signals as well as new receiver architectures including advanced tracking and acquisition algorithms. These algorithms might, for example, decrease the Time To First Fix (TTFF) or increase resistance to jamming. Lastly, anti-jam GPS or GNSS antennas and related techniques will be considered as well.</p>
<p><br />RESEARCH INTEREST TOPIC FIVE (5)</p>
<p>Research Interest: Aiding Sensors for Navigation Systems <br />Division: CERDEC, CP&amp;I Directorate, Positioning, Navigation and Timing Division</p>
<p>Objective: The goal for this topic is to identify, develop, demonstrate and advance navigation aiding technologies for dismounted soldiers and ground vehicle platforms where GPS performance is degraded or unavailable. Ultimately projects considered and selected for funding under this topic will provide improved situational awareness capabilities and support of mission command and decision enhancing technologies.</p>
<p>Description: Primary considerations for aiding sensors include SWAP-C, as well as the ability for the aiding sensors to improve GPS position accuracy or maintain similar performance for extended periods of time in the absence of GPS signals. Systems that do not emit radiation or have minimal and/or controlled radiated emissions are considered more favorable. Physical hardware modularity, ease for embedding, adapting or optimizing to fit onto a range of military platforms (e.g., dismounted soldiers, combat vehicles or possibly aerial vehicles) and the ability for future systems upgrades, including software, are highly desirable characteristics. The ability for proposed systems to function properly, and adhere to architectures anticipated, in the Army Common Operating Environment (COE) is also considered highly advantageous. Examples of technologies of possible interest for aiding sensors for military navigation systems, include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) Vision-based navigation systems and techniques including advanced computer tracking, mapping and feature identification and extraction algorithms, optical-lens technology and miniature solid-state materials, devices and cameras; (2) Systems based upon light-detection and ranging (LIDAR) or laser-detection and ranging (LADAR); (3) Radio-frequency (RF) ranging, especially that which consumes minimal radio bandwidth and power, and which has minimal impact on adjacent radio communications systems; (4) Velocity sensors, speed detectors, magnetometers and other passive sensors for advanced orientation and navigation techniques; and (5) Network-assisted navigation systems and concepts.</p>
<p>&emsp;</p>
<p>RESEARCH INTEREST TOPIC SIX (6)</p>

<p>8.1 Evaluation</p>
<p>Full proposals will be evaluated by a process of peer and/or scientific review. Proper funding must be available for an award to be made. Full proposals will not be evaluated against other proposals in the same general research area, as they are not submitted in accordance with a common SOW. Awards will be made based on the merit and relevance of the specific research proposal as it relates to overall CP&amp;I Directorate requirements and based on its government evaluation using the criteria listed below.</p>
<p>8.2 Evaluation Criteria</p>
<p>8.2.1 The Government will evaluate each full proposal received in response to this BAA in accordance with the following criteria:</p>
<p>A. Technical:</p>
<p>I. The scientific and technical quality of the research proposal and its relevance to the area of interest addressed, with special emphasis on its innovation, originality, and importance to specified agency programs.</p>
<p>ii. Feasibility of the proposed SOW.</p>
<p>iii. The offeror's capabilities and techniques, or unique combinations of these, as integral factors in achieving the proposed objectives.</p>
<p>iv. The offeror's past performance will be used to evaluate the likelihood of technical success on this BAA. The government reserves the right to use self-submitted past performance data, questionnaires, or the CPARS and PPIRS systems to properly evaluate an offeror's past performance information. The evaluators will also consider a record of accomplishment in specific topic areas, including patents and publications.</p>
<p>B. Cost: The government will evaluate the reasonableness and realism of proposed costs to determine if the overall costs proposed are realistic for the work to be performed, if the costs reflect an offeror's understanding of the requirements, and if the costs are consistent with the various elements of the technical proposal.</p>
<p>C. Program Management:</p>
<p>I. Feasibility of the management structure, management approach and availability of key facilities. The proposed schedule, milestones, and deliverables will also be considered.</p>
<p>ii. The qualifications, capabilities, and personal work experience of the proposed Principal Investigator and key personnel who are critical in achieving the proposed objectives.</p>
<p>8.2.2 Evaluation Criteria - Order of Importance</p>
<p>Any awards will be made with appropriate consideration given to the three (3) evaluation factors: Technical, Cost, and Program Management. The Technical Factor is significantly more important than the Cost Factor. The Cost Factor is significantly more important that the Program Management Factor.</p>
<p>8.3 Full Proposals from Canadian Companies<br />Full proposals from Canadian companies submitted under the auspices of the United States-Canada Defense Development Sharing Program (DDSP) will be evaluated using criteria cited in the Proposal Evaluation section above and processed in accordance with implementing provisions of the International Trade Agreement set forth by AR 70-41, AR 70-1, dated 16 Jun 17, and AMC Pamphlet 70-20.</p>

<DESC>Certified Low Vision Therapist Services

The Great Lakes Acquisition Center (GLAC), on behalf of the William S. Middleton Memorial Veterans Hospital (Madison VA Hospital), 2500 Overlook Terrace, Madison, Wisconsin 53705 (hereinafter called VA), intends to issue a sole source one-year contract to the Wisconsin Council of the Blind and Visually Impaired Inc., 754 Williamson Street, Madison, Wisconsin 53703 (hereinafter called the Council) pursuant to VETERANS FIRST procurement IAW 38 USC 8127, Public Law 109-461 section 502 and VAAR 819.7007; and to 38 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1 Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  

The VA has an immediate need to contract for an individual possessing an active, current, full and unrestricted certification as a Low Vision Therapists (CLVT).  The certification must be granted by the Academy for Certification of Vision Rehabilitation & Education Professionals (ACVREP).  The individual must also hold a bachelor s degree (from an accredited college or university with a major field of study) in blind or vision rehabilitation, related program in rehabilitation, special education, family and consumer science education, technology and industrial arts education, or health care.

The VA has attempted to hire its own CLVTs through two recent recruitment announcements, but was unsuccessful in both cases.  The VA is preparing for its Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF) reaccreditation.  However, to obtain this accreditation, the VA is required to have a Certified Low Vision Therapist providing low vision services on-site.  Madison VA Hospital has been without a Certified Low Vision Therapist for over two years and has been aggressively recruiting for this position; without success.  These services are available on a very limited basis nationally.  The services are currently being provided by VA s Low Vision Optometrist.  Based on market research, no Veteran Owned Small Business were identified that can provide Certified Low Vision Therapists.  The GSA eLibrary and FBO.gov were researched and no vendors were identified that could provide this service in the Madison area.  Other sources have been sought out such as the University of Wisconsin Hospital & Clinics without success as they do not have a Low Vision program offered at their facility.  No other source for this uniquely qualified clinical specialist is available.

The Wisconsin Council of the Blind & Visually Impaired is positioned to offer a uniquely qualified, skilled and certified Low Vision Therapist who can satisfy the VA s need to complete its continuum of rehabilitative care for visually impaired Veterans.  The Council is a private, non-for-profit agency.   
 
Responsibilities
The incumbent serves as a Certified Low Vision Therapist (CLVT) in the Ophthalmology Section of the Surgical Service. 

  Administers scores and interprets a variety of coping skills tests.
  Evaluate patient's physical, mental, emotional, social, and vocational capabilities to assess the need for treatment and services.
  Administer tests for patients with severe vision-related problems.
  Maintain professional currency in testing procedures and practices and introduces new methods.

  Develop treatment plans and recommend pertinent services using the patient's assessment and physician's/nurse's orders.
  Develop intermediate and long-term goals and objectives with each patient.

Work Schedule: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday / four hours per day
The Council is the only contractor that has the resources (manpower, experience, technical/operational knowledge and proper certification) to perform the critical mission for the one-year contract.  The service provider has provided these services at the VA in previous years and will not require any training for the VISTA or CPRS VA systems.
 
Sources interested in responding to this notice are required to submit a capability statement that includes experience and certifications.  A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed with a sole source contract.

Responses to this announcement must be submitted in writing to the Contracting Officer no later than 10:00 a.m. Central Time, November 30, 2017 to the following email address: Prudence.Holland@va.gov.

<p><br />CONTRACTOR UNCLASSIFIED ACCESS<br />Contractor Unclassified Access to Federally Controlled Facilities, Sensitive Information, Information Technology (IT) Systems or Protected Health Information (Jan 2017)</p>
<p>Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, requires government agencies to develop and implement Federal security standards for Federal employees and contractors. The Deputy Secretary of Defense Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-006 - "DoD Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive - 12 (HSPD-12)" dated November 26, 2008 (or its subsequent DoD instruction) directs implementation of HSPD-12. This clause is in accordance with HSPD-12 and its implementing directives.</p>
<p>APPLICABILITY</p>
<p>This text applies to contractor employees requiring physical access to any area of a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoN or DoD computer/network/system to perform certain unclassified sensitive duties. This clause also applies to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information, provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified as National Security Position, as advised by the command security manager. It is the responsibility of the responsible security officer of the command/facility where the work is performed to ensure compliance. <br /><br />Each contractor employee providing services at a Navy Command under this contract is required to obtain a Department of Defense Common Access Card (DoD CAC). Additionally, depending on the level of computer/network access, the contract employee will require a successful investigation as detailed below.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO FEDERAL FACILITIES</p>
<p>Per HSPD-12 and implementing guidance, all contractor employees working at a federally controlled base, facility or activity under this clause will require a DoD CAC. When access to a base, facility or activity is required contractor employees shall in-process with the Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO DOD IT SYSTEMS</p>
<p>In accordance with SECNAV M-5510.30, contractor employees who require access to DoN or DoD networks are categorized as IT-I, IT-II, or IT-III. The IT-II level, defined in detail in SECNAV M-5510.30, includes positions which require access to information protected under the Privacy Act, to include Protected Health Information (PHI). All contractor employees under this contract who require access to Privacy Act protected information are therefore categorized no lower than IT-II. IT Levels are determined by the requiring activity's Command Information Assurance Manager.</p>
<p>Contractor employees requiring privileged or IT-I level access, (when specified by the terms of the contract) require a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) or T5 or T5R equivalent investigation , which is a higher level investigation than the National Agency Check with Law and Credit (NACLC)/T3/T3R described below. Due to the privileged system access, an investigation suitable for High Risk national security positions is required. Individuals who have access to system control, monitoring, or administration functions (e.g. system administrator, database administrator) require training and certification to Information Assurance Technical Level 1, and must be trained and certified on the Operating System or Computing Environment they are required to maintain.</p>
<p>Access to sensitive IT systems is contingent upon a favorably adjudicated background investigation. When access to IT systems is required for performance of the contractor employee's duties, such employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The decision to authorize access to a government IT system/network is inherently governmental. The contractor supervisor is not authorized to sign the SAAR-N; therefore, the government employee with knowledge of the system/network access required or the COR shall sign the SAAR-N as the "supervisor".</p>
<p>The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date. <br /><br />When required to maintain access to required IT systems or networks, the contractor shall ensure that all employees requiring access complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p><br />INTERIM ACCESS</p>
<p>The Command's Security Manager may authorize issuance of a DoD CAC and interim access to a DoN or DoD unclassified computer/network upon a favorable review of the investigative questionnaire and advance favorable fingerprint results. When the results of the investigation are received and a favorable determination is not made, the contractor employee working on the contract under interim access will be denied access to the computer network and this denial will not relieve the contractor of his/her responsibility to perform.</p>
<p>DENIAL OR TERMINATION OF ACCESS</p>
<p>The potential consequences of any requirement under this clause including denial or termination of physical or system access in no way relieves the contractor from the requirement to execute performance under the contract within the timeframes specified in the contract. Contractors shall plan ahead in processing their employees and subcontractor employees. The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is permitted to have unclassified access to a federally controlled facility, federally-controlled information system/network and/or to government information, meaning information not authorized for public release.</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR'S SECURITY REPRESENTATIVE</p>
<p>The contractor shall designate an employee to serve as the Contractor's Security Representative. Within three work days after contract award, the contractor shall provide to the requiring activity's Security Manager and the Contracting Officer, in writing, the name, title, address and phone number for the Contractor's Security Representative. The Contractor's Security Representative shall be the primary point of contact on any security matter. The Contractor's Security Representative shall not be replaced or removed without prior notice to the Contracting Officer and Command Security Manager.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO NATIONAL SECURITY POSITIONS OR PERFORMING SENSITIVE DUTIES</p>
<p>Navy security policy requires that all positions be given a sensitivity value based on level of risk factors to ensure appropriate protective measures are applied. Contractor employees under this contract are recognized as Non-Critical Sensitive [ADP/IT-II] positions when the contract scope of work require physical access to a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoD computer/network, to perform unclassified sensitive duties. This designation is also applied to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information (PHI), provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified as National Security Positions. At a minimum, each contractor employee must be a US citizen and have a favorably completed NACLC or T3 or T3R equivalent investigation to obtain a favorable determination for assignment to a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position. The investigation consists of a standard NAC and a FBI fingerprint check plus law enforcement checks and credit check. Each contractor employee filling a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position is required to complete:</p>
<p>&bull; SF-86 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (or equivalent OPM investigative product)<br />&bull; Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission)<br />&bull; Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. Background investigations shall be reinitiated as required to ensure investigations remain current (not older than 10 years) throughout the contract performance period. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>Regardless of their duties or IT access requirements ALL contractor employees shall in-process with the Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Employees requiring IT access shall also check-in and check-out with the Navy Command's Information Assurance Manager. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. <br /><br />The contractor shall ensure that each contract employee requiring access to IT systems or networks complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. Contractor employees shall accurately complete the required investigative forms prior to submission to the Command Security Manager. The Command's Security Manager will review the submitted documentation for completeness prior to submitting it to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM); Potential suitability or security issues identified may render the contractor employee ineligible for the assignment. An unfavorable determination is final (subject to SF-86 appeal procedures) and such a determination does not relieve the contractor from meeting any contractual obligation under the contract. The Command's Security Manager will forward the required forms to OPM for processing. Once the investigation is complete, the results will be forwarded by OPM to the DoD Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) for a determination.</p>
<p>If the contractor employee already possesses a current favorably adjudicated investigation, the contractor shall submit a Visit Authorization Request (VAR) via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) or a hard copy VAR directly from the contractor's Security Representative. Although the contractor will take JPAS "Owning" role over the contractor employee, the Command will take JPAS "Servicing" role over the contractor employee during the hiring process and for the duration of assignment under that contract. The contractor shall include the IT Position Category per SECNAV M-5510.30 for each employee designated on a VAR. The VAR requires annual renewal for the duration of the employee's performance under the contract.</p>

<p><br />VENDORMATE<br />Vendormate Credentialing Requirement<br />Naval Medical Center, Portsmouth (NMCP) has instituted a Credentialing Program which is designed to streamline the collection and management of key information regarding the regulatory and compliance status as well as business operations of our suppliers. <br />The program requires all vendors and their representatives to register in order to gain base access to NMCP. One nominal annual credentialing fee covers your company as well as all representatives of your company that interact with NMCP.<br />The price ranges from $25 to $250 per year depending on your company's risk profile and is paid directly to our partner, Vendormate Credentialing. It is imperative that each representative registers individually to maintain their personal credentials and ensure ongoing base access to our facility. <br />A Federal Tax Identification Number and a credit card are required to complete the initial registration. Additional representatives only need the Federal Tax Identification Number.<br />Register for Vendormate Credentialing at https://nmcp.vendormate.com. <br />For technical questions, go to https://ghx.com/customer-care. <br />Kiosks are located on the first and second floor entrances of Building two (2). Your representatives who visit NMCP may be required to sign in electronically to obtain an identification badge. With a valid appointment and current credentials, your representative will be able to print a single-use badge that is to be worn throughout the visit to any NMCP facility. Badges are required for all vendors on premises.<br />Please note that GHX Vendormate Credentialing is in addition to RapidGate for Base Access. Vendors are required to register for both programs in order to come onboard the NMCP base.</p>
<p><br />BASE ACCESS<br />Base Access (NMCP)</p>
<p>Commander, Navy Installations Command (CNIC), has established the Navy Commercial Access Control System (NCACS), a standardized process for granting unescorted access privileges to vendors, contractors, suppliers and service providers not otherwise entitled to the issuance of a Common Access Card (CAC) who seek access to and can provide justification to enter Navy installations and facilities. Vendors visiting Naval Medical Center Portsmouth (NMCP) may obtain daily passes directly from Naval Station Norfolk (NSN) Pass and ID office, located at NSN (Bldg CD-9), 9040 Hampton Blvd, Norfolk, Virginia, 23505, by submitting identification credentials for verification and undergoing a criminal screening/ background check. Alternatively, if the vendor so chooses, it may voluntarily elect to obtain long-term credentials through enrollment, registration, background vetting, screening, issuance of credentials, and electronic validation of credentials at its own cost through one of the designated independent contractor NCACS service providers. Credentials will be issued every five years and access privileges will be reviewed / renewed on an annual basis. The costs incurred to obtain Navy installation access of any kind are not reimbursable, and the price(s) paid for obtaining long-term NCACS credentials will not be approved as a direct cost of this contract. Further information regarding NCACS can be found at http://cnic.navy.mil/CNIC_HQ_Site/index.htm.<br /><br />Section I - Contract Clauses</p>

All successful offerors are required to be, and show proof of being, an Emerson Authorized Service Repair Company and APC service repair company.  This is a non-negotiable factor and checks will be conducted to verify prospective vendors OEM authorization to work on the equipment.

Â Â (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
Award shall be made to the contractor whose quotation offers the lowest priced technically acceptable to the government, considering technical capability, past performance, and price. The government shall evaluate information based on the following evaluation criteria: 
Technical capability to meet all of the requirements of the SOW, please provide a maximum 5 page capability statement. Offers for partial requirement will not be evaluated and will be deemed non-responsive upon receipt. 

Price: Vendor s price must be fair and reasonable as determined by Contracting Officer s price analysis.

Past Performance: Â Identify at least three references, preferably federal agency contracts, including contract number, dates of performance, points of contact, and telephone numbers, whereby you have provided the same or similar services, of the magnitude described in this solicitation.Â  References will be considered in the evaluation process. Offerors should send their listed private sector references a letter, authorizing the reference to provide past performance information to the Government.

The contractor s past performance will be evaluated based on the following: reliability, cost, order accuracy, delivery/timeliness, quality, business relations, personnel, customer support, and responsiveness.Â  Relevant past performance information shall include key personnel who have relevant experience, predecessor companies, and subcontractors who will perform major or critical elements of this solicitation. The contracting office will also review performance history in PPIRS. Offerors without relevant past performance or for whom past performance information is not available, will receive a neutral rating.Â  

Â Â  
Â Â (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
Â  (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
This requirement includes options executed under FAR 52.217-8. The government will evaluate prices for the option under FAR 52.217-8 by using the last year s option prices to calculate the price for six months of efforts, and adding that amount to the base and other option years to arrive at the total. 
 (x) The provisions at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items applies to this acquisition. * All firms or individuals submitting a quote shall include a completed copy of this provision, OR have current Representations and Certifications in the System for Award Management (SAM - https://www.sam.gov).

<p><br />NOAA Acquisition Alert Notification</p>
<p>Contractor Access to NOAA Facilities (SEPT 2017)</p>
<p>(a)(1) The performance of this contract requires employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members ("contractor employees") to have access to and to the extent authorized, mobility within, a NOAA facility.</p>
<p>(2) NOAA may close and or otherwise deny contractor employees access to a NOAA facility for a portion of a business day or longer for various reasons including, but not limited, to the following events:</p>
<p>(i)	Federal public holidays for federal employees in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 6103;</p>
<p>(ii)	Fires, floods, earthquakes, and unusually severe weather, including but not limited to snow storms, tornadoes, and hurricanes;</p>
<p>(iii)	Occupational safety or health hazards;</p>
<p>(iv)	Lapse in Appropriations; or</p>
<p>(v)	Federal Statute, Executive Order, Presidential Proclamation, or any other unforeseen reason.</p>
<p>(3) In such events, the contractor employees may be denied access to a NOAA facility that is ordinarily available for the contractor to perform work or make delivery, as required by the contract.</p>
<p>(b)	In all instances where contractors are denied access or required to vacate a NOAA facility, in part or in whole, the contractor shall be responsible to ensure contractor personnel working under the contract comply.  If the circumstances permit, the contracting officer will provide direction to the contractor, either directly or through the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), which could include continuing on-site performance during the NOAA facility closure period; however, if Government oversight is required and is not available, on-site performance shall not be allowed. In the absence of such direction, the contractor shall exercise sound judgment to minimize unnecessary contract costs and performance impacts, for example, performing required work off-site if possible or reassigning personnel to other activities if appropriate.</p>
<p>(c)	The contractor shall be responsible for monitoring the Office of Personnel Management at www.opm.gov, the local radio, television stations, NOAA web sites, and other communication channels.  Once the facility is accessible, the contractor shall resume contract performance as required by the contract.</p>
<p>(d)	For the period that NOAA facilities were not accessible to contractors who required access in order to perform the services, the contracting officer may-</p>
<p>(1)	Adjust the contract performance or delivery schedule for a period equivalent to the period the NOAA facility was not accessible;</p>
<p>(2)	Forego the work; or</p>
<p>(3)	Reschedule the work by mutual agreement of the parties.</p>
<p>(e)	Notification procedures of a NOAA facility closure, including contractor denial of access, are as follows:<br />(1)	The contractor shall be responsible for notification of its employees of the NOAA facility closure to include denial of access to the NOAA facility.  The dismissal of NOAA employees in accordance with statute and regulations providing for such dismissals shall not, in itself, equate to a NOAA facility closure in which contractors are denied access.  Moreover, the leave status of NOAA employees shall not be conveyed or imputed to contractor personnel.  Accordingly, unless a NOAA facility is closed and the contractor is denied access to the facility, the contractor shall continue performance in accordance with the contract.</p>
<p>(2)	Access to Government facilities and resources, including equipment and systems, will be limited and personnel necessary to administer contract performance may not be available. Generally, supply and service contracts that are funded beyond the date of the lapse in appropriation and do not require access to Government facilities, active administration by Government personnel or the use of government resources in a manner that would cause the government to incur additional obligations during the lapse in appropriation may continue.  If a delivery date for a contract falls during the period of a lapse in appropriations, Government personnel may not be available to receive delivery.  Contractors are directed to consult with a contracting officer before attempting to make a delivery.  Contracting officers will be available throughout the lapse in appropriation period to provide guidance.</p>
<p>Once OMB guidance is given, CORs, in consultation with the contracting officer, will notify those contractors that are deemed by the Program Office to be performing excepted work and identify the contractor personnel requiring access to NOAA facilities.  CORs will also coordinate with directly with facility management or physical security personnel at respective locations to ensure that the names of contractor personnel requiring access to government facilities during the lapse in appropriations are provided to physical security personnel.</p>
<p>Contractors who are not designated as performing excepted work are not allowed access to Government facilities or to utilize government resources in a manner that would incur any additional obligation of funding on behalf of the government during the lapse in appropriation.</p>
<p>(3) Unless otherwise specified within the contract award, contractors requiring access to NOAA facilities outside normal business hours or outside the normal workweek shall submit a written request in writing through the COR to the contracting officer.  The written request shall provide justification supporting the required access and be submitted 72 hours/days (contracting officer insert number of days. <br /> (End of Solicitation and Contract Language)</p>
<p>NOAA Government-Contractor Relations - Non-Personal Services Contract (SEPT 2017)</p>
<p>(a)	The Government and the Contractor understand and agree that the services to be delivered under this contract by the Contractor to the Government are non-personal services as defined in FAR Part 37, Service Contracting, and the parties recognize and agree that no employer-employee relationship exists or will exist under the contract between the Government and the Contractor's personnel.  It is, therefore, in the best interest of the Government to afford both parties an understanding of their respective obligations.</p>
<p>(b)	Contractor personnel under this contract shall not:</p>
<p>(1)	Be placed in a position where they are under relatively continuous supervision and control of a Government employee.</p>
<p>(2)	Be placed in a position of command, supervision, administration, or control over Government personnel or over personnel of other Contractors performing under other NOAA contracts.</p>
<p>(c)	The services to be performed under this contract do not require the Contractor or the Contractor's personnel to exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Government.  Rather, the Contractor's personnel will act and exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Contractor.</p>
<p>(d)	Rules, regulations, directives, and requirements that are issued by the Department of Commerce and NOAA under its responsibility for good order, administration, and security are applicable to all personnel who enter the Government installation and facilities, who are provided access to Government systems, or who travel on Government transportation. This is not to be construed or interpreted to establish any degree of Government control that is inconsistent with a non-personal services contract.</p>
<p>(e)	Both parties are responsible for monitoring contract activities for indications of improper employee-employer relationships during performance.  In the event a situation or occurrence takes place inconsistent with this contract language, the following applies:</p>
<p>(1)	The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing within 5 business days from the date of any situation or occurrence where the Contractor considers specific contract activity to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language.  The notice must include the date, nature and circumstance of the situation or occurrence, the name, function and activity of each Government employee or Contractor employee involved or knowledgeable about the situation or occurrence, provide any documents or the substance of any oral communications related to the activity, and an estimated date by which the Government is recommended to respond to the notice in order to minimize cost, delay, or disruption of performance.</p>
<p>(2)	The Contracting Officer will review the information provided by the Contractor, obtain additional information (if needed), and respond in writing as soon as practicable after receipt of the notification from the Contractor.  The Contracting Officer's response will provide a decision on whether the Contracting Officer determines the situation or occurrence to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language and, if deemed necessary, will specify any corrective action(s) to be taken in order to resolve the issue.<br /> (End of Solicitation and Contract Language)</p>
<p><br />NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>a.	The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1.	Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2.	Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3.	Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b.	The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c.	Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d.	There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1.	Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A&bull;76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6.	The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7.	The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e.	After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f.	The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g.	Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.  <br />(End of solicitation and contract language)</p>
<p>Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12) AUG 2004</p>
<p>The performance of this contract requires contractors to have physical access to Federal premises for more than 180 days or access to a Federal information system.  Any items or services delivered under this contract shall comply with the Department of Commerce personal identify verification procedures that implement HSPD-12, FIPS PUB 201 and OMB Memorandum M-05-24.  The Contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is required to have physical access to a Federally controlled facility or access to a Federal information system.</p>
<p>Contractor Access to NOAA Facilities (SEPT 2017)</p>
<p>(a)(1) The performance of this contract requires employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members ("contractor employees") to have access to and to the extent authorized, mobility within, a NOAA facility.</p>
<p>(2) NOAA may close and or otherwise deny contractor employees access to a NOAA facility for a portion of a business day or longer for various reasons including, but not limited, to the following events:</p>

<p>(iii)	Occupational safety or health hazards;</p>
<p>(iv)	Lapse in Appropriations; or</p>
<p>(v)	Federal Statute, Executive Order, Presidential Proclamation, or any other unforeseen reason.</p>
<p>(3) In such events, the contractor employees may be denied access to a NOAA facility that is ordinarily available for the contractor to perform work or make delivery, as required by the contract.</p>
<p>(b)	In all instances where contractors are denied access or required to vacate a NOAA facility, in part or in whole, the contractor shall be responsible to ensure contractor personnel working under the contract comply.

<p><br />CONTRACTOR UNCLASSIFIED ACCESS<br />Contractor Unclassified Access to Federally Controlled Facilities, Sensitive Information, Information Technology (IT) Systems or Protected Health Information (Jan 2017)</p>
<p>Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, requires government agencies to develop and implement Federal security standards for Federal employees and contractors. The Deputy Secretary of Defense Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-006 - "DoD Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive - 12 (HSPD-12)" dated November 26, 2008 (or its subsequent DoD instruction) directs implementation of HSPD-12. This clause is in accordance with HSPD-12 and its implementing directives.</p>
<p>APPLICABILITY</p>
<p>This text applies to contractor employees requiring physical access to any area of a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoN or DoD computer/network/system to perform certain unclassified sensitive duties. This clause also applies to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information, provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified as National Security Position, as advised by the command security manager. It is the responsibility of the responsible security officer of the command/facility where the work is performed to ensure compliance. <br /><br />Each contractor employee providing services at a Navy Command under this contract is required to obtain a Department of Defense Common Access Card (DoD CAC). Additionally, depending on the level of computer/network access, the contract employee will require a successful investigation as detailed below.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO FEDERAL FACILITIES</p>
<p>Per HSPD-12 and implementing guidance, all contractor employees working at a federally controlled base, facility or activity under this clause will require a DoD CAC. When access to a base, facility or activity is required contractor employees shall in-process with the Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO DOD IT SYSTEMS</p>
<p>In accordance with SECNAV M-5510.30, contractor employees who require access to DoN or DoD networks are categorized as IT-I, IT-II, or IT-III. The IT-II level, defined in detail in SECNAV M-5510.30, includes positions which require access to information protected under the Privacy Act, to include Protected Health Information (PHI). All contractor employees under this contract who require access to Privacy Act protected information are therefore categorized no lower than IT-II. IT Levels are determined by the requiring activity's Command Information Assurance Manager.</p>
<p>Contractor employees requiring privileged or IT-I level access, (when specified by the terms of the contract) require a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) or T5 or T5R equivalent investigation , which is a higher level investigation than the National Agency Check with Law and Credit (NACLC)/T3/T3R described below. Due to the privileged system access, an investigation suitable for High Risk national security positions is required. Individuals who have access to system control, monitoring, or administration functions (e.g. system administrator, database administrator) require training and certification to Information Assurance Technical Level 1, and must be trained and certified on the Operating System or Computing Environment they are required to maintain.</p>
<p>Access to sensitive IT systems is contingent upon a favorably adjudicated background investigation. When access to IT systems is required for performance of the contractor employee's duties, such employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The decision to authorize access to a government IT system/network is inherently governmental. The contractor supervisor is not authorized to sign the SAAR-N; therefore, the government employee with knowledge of the system/network access required or the COR shall sign the SAAR-N as the "supervisor".</p>
<p>The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date. <br /><br />When required to maintain access to required IT systems or networks, the contractor shall ensure that all employees requiring access complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p><br />INTERIM ACCESS</p>
<p>The Command's Security Manager may authorize issuance of a DoD CAC and interim access to a DoN or DoD unclassified computer/network upon a favorable review of the investigative questionnaire and advance favorable fingerprint results. When the results of the investigation are received and a favorable determination is not made, the contractor employee working on the contract under interim access will be denied access to the computer network and this denial will not relieve the contractor of his/her responsibility to perform.</p>
<p>DENIAL OR TERMINATION OF ACCESS</p>
<p>The potential consequences of any requirement under this clause including denial or termination of physical or system access in no way relieves the contractor from the requirement to execute performance under the contract within the timeframes specified in the contract. Contractors shall plan ahead in processing their employees and subcontractor employees. The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is permitted to have unclassified access to a federally controlled facility, federally-controlled information system/network and/or to government information, meaning information not authorized for public release.</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR'S SECURITY REPRESENTATIVE</p>
<p>The contractor shall designate an employee to serve as the Contractor's Security Representative. Within three work days after contract award, the contractor shall provide to the requiring activity's Security Manager and the Contracting Officer, in writing, the name, title, address and phone number for the Contractor's Security Representative. The Contractor's Security Representative shall be the primary point of contact on any security matter. The Contractor's Security Representative shall not be replaced or removed without prior notice to the Contracting Officer and Command Security Manager.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO NATIONAL SECURITY POSITIONS OR PERFORMING SENSITIVE DUTIES</p>
<p>Navy security policy requires that all positions be given a sensitivity value based on level of risk factors to ensure appropriate protective measures are applied. Contractor employees under this contract are recognized as Non-Critical Sensitive [ADP/IT-II] positions when the contract scope of work require physical access to a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoD computer/network, to perform unclassified sensitive duties. This designation is also applied to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information (PHI), provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified as National Security Positions. At a minimum, each contractor employee must be a US citizen and have a favorably completed NACLC or T3 or T3R equivalent investigation to obtain a favorable determination for assignment to a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position. The investigation consists of a standard NAC and a FBI fingerprint check plus law enforcement checks and credit check. Each contractor employee filling a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position is required to complete:</p>
<p>&bull; SF-86 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (or equivalent OPM investigative product)<br />&bull; Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission)<br />&bull; Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. Background investigations shall be reinitiated as required to ensure investigations remain current (not older than 10 years) throughout the contract performance period. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>Regardless of their duties or IT access requirements ALL contractor employees shall in-process with the Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Employees requiring IT access shall also check-in and check-out with the Navy Command's Information Assurance Manager. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. <br /><br />The contractor shall ensure that each contract employee requiring access to IT systems or networks complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. Contractor employees shall accurately complete the required investigative forms prior to submission to the Command Security Manager. The Command's Security Manager will review the submitted documentation for completeness prior to submitting it to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM); Potential suitability or security issues identified may render the contractor employee ineligible for the assignment. An unfavorable determination is final (subject to SF-86 appeal procedures) and such a determination does not relieve the contractor from meeting any contractual obligation under the contract. The Command's Security Manager will forward the required forms to OPM for processing. Once the investigation is complete, the results will be forwarded by OPM to the DoD Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) for a determination.</p>
<p>If the contractor employee already possesses a current favorably adjudicated investigation, the contractor shall submit a Visit Authorization Request (VAR) via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) or a hard copy VAR directly from the contractor's Security Representative. Although the contractor will take JPAS "Owning" role over the contractor employee, the Command will take JPAS "Servicing" role over the contractor employee during the hiring process and for the duration of assignment under that contract. The contractor shall include the IT Position Category per SECNAV M-5510.30 for each employee designated on a VAR. The VAR requires annual renewal for the duration of the employee's performance under the contract.</p>

One nominal annual credentialing fee covers your company as well as all representatives of your company that interact with NMCP.<br />The price ranges from $25 to $250 per year depending on your company's risk profile and is paid directly to our partner, Vendormate Credentialing. It is imperative that each representative registers individually to maintain their personal credentials and ensure ongoing base access to our facility. <br />A Federal Tax Identification Number and a credit card are required to complete the initial registration. Additional representatives only need the Federal Tax Identification Number.<br />Register for Vendormate Credentialing at https://nmcp.vendormate.com. <br />For technical questions, go to https://ghx.com/customer-care. <br />Kiosks are located on the first and second floor entrances of Building two (2). Your representatives who visit NMCP may be required to sign in electronically to obtain an identification badge. With a valid appointment and current credentials, your representative will be able to print a single-use badge that is to be worn throughout the visit to any NMCP facility. Badges are required for all vendors on premises.<br />Please note that GHX Vendormate Credentialing is in addition to RapidGate for Base Access.

Credentials will be issued every five years and access privileges will be reviewed / renewed on an annual basis. The costs incurred to obtain Navy installation access of any kind are not reimbursable, and the price(s) paid for obtaining long-term NCACS credentials will not be approved as a direct cost of this contract.

<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This procurement is being conducted under FAR Part 13.5, Simplified Acquisition Procedures and FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items (Title VIII of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-355)). The Billings Area Indian Health Service (IHS) intends to award a fixed-price commercial item contract in response to Request for Quotation (RFQ)-10-18-002-KN. This solicitation is issued as a Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Business set-aside. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-95. The associated North American Industry Classification System code is 621512 and the small business size standard is $15.0 million.</p>

<p>***THE FOLLOWING CHANGES AND UPDATES ARE APPLIED TO THIS AMENDMENT***<br /><br />1. This amendment withdraws the unrestricted status and changes the solicitation to a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Business set aside. The NAICS is also changed from 621493 to 621512.<br />&nbsp;<br />2. Period of Performance: The intended start date is December 4, 2017. This can be adjusted after award is made and coordinated with the project officer, Jerry Smith.<br />&nbsp;<br />3. Mobilization/Demoblization: Mobilization periods will be conducted within a 2-week timeframe.<br /><br />4. Evaluation Factors: The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers and are listed in the order of importance:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) - Technical Capability. Offeror must submit a detailed response to the information covered in the Statement of Work. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) - Past Performance. The Contractor must demonstrate its record of successful performance in past contracts and/or jobs, Government and/or Commercial. Each offeror will be evaluated on its performance under existing and prior contracts/jobs. The offeror must include at least three references.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) - Cost/Price. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 60 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers. Price is not assigned an adjectival rating or scored; it will be evaluated to determine whether it is reasonable and if it reflects the offeror's understanding of the work. Technical and Past Performance, when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price.</p>
<p>BASIS FOR AWARD<br />Selection of the successful offeror will be made based on the evaluation criteria. The quotations will be evaluated and a contract awarded under the Best Value Continuum approach to permit tradeoffs among cost or price and non-cost factors. This will allow the Government to consider award to other than the lowest priced offeror or other than the highest technically rated offeror who meets or exceeds the technical acceptability standards established in the factors referenced above.</p>
<p>This amendment extends the closing date to&nbsp;December 01, 2017 at 4pm MST. <br /><br />**Be sure to make note of changes made from the original posting when submitting proposals**</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air System Command (NAVAIR), Naval Air Station (NAS) Patuxent River, MD, intends to procure, on a sole source basis, multiple efforts under a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) to Teledyne Electronic Safety Products (TESP) of Chatsworth, California, to provide Navy Aircrew Common Ejection Seat (NACES) sequencers, along with necessary supplies and services to support the F/A-18 and EA-18G aircraft and subsystems on behalf of U.S. Navy (USN) and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) programs.

Teledyne Electronic Safety Products is the sole designer, developer, and manufacturer of the NACES&nbsp;Sequencer and therefore is the only source with the requisite knowledge, experience, and technical data that can meet the Government's requirements on a timely basis and in a cost effective manner in order to meet fleet requirements.<br />THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. Interested parties, however, may identify their interest and capability by responding to the requirement. The Government will consider all information received prior to the closing date of this synopsis. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract modification based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. No phone inquiries will be entertained. Responses shall be made in writing by E-mail, U.S. mail or facsimile to the attention of Mr. Joseph Perry or Mr. Jamie Billig using the contact information provided in this synopsis.<br />Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Mr. Bob Ferguson <a href="mailto:bferguson@teledyne.com">bferguson@teledyne.com</a>.</p>

<DESC>The USDA Forest Service has chosen to cancel the current VIPR pre-season I-BPAs for National Crew Carrier Buses (awarded under solicitation AG-024B-S-14-7000) in accordance with Section C.3.3 of that agreement. The current Agreements will remain in effect until such time that the new Agreements are awarded (estimated 2nd quarter fiscal year 2018). The reasoning for this cancelation is that there are new safety requirements that need to be incorporated into the specifications for Crew Carrier Buses provided under this agreement. These changes were out of scope and could not be done under the current agreement. There is a current synopsis posted to FBO.gov for the new requirement 12024B-18-Q-7000 (originally posted incorrectly as 12024B-Q-18-7000). The draft specifications for this requirement can be found at https://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/solicitations.php . Please hold any questions related to these specifications until the solicitation is posted.  The intent of this solicitation is to obtain crew carrier buses as defined in the solicitation, for Local, Regional, and Nationwide fire suppression and all-hazard incidents.  We anticipate issuing the solicitation within 15 days of the date of this notice.  The Government anticipates awarding multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements.  A single, national solicitation will be issued to obtain these services.  This solicitation will be issued using the Virtual Incident Procurement (VIPR) System.  To use VIPR you must have access to a computer and the internet.  Basic information you will need to be aware of to participate in this solicitation is located on the web at http:www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendorapp.php  The VIPR helpdesk phone number is 866-224-7677.
