<DESC>The Mission &amp; Installation Contracting Command- Fort Dix intends to solicit &amp; award an acquisition for lodging and conference services in the Poconos, PA area. The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and other items necessary to provide the requested services.

This is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services. For a proposal submitted by an offeror that is not a hotel, the offeror must describe in its proposal the technical approach for the offeror's services as a prime contractor and submit a complete technical proposal for evaluation purposes. (Again, this is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services. An offer which requires the Government to execute a separate agreement with a third party hotel shall be deemed technically unacceptable). This synopsis is provided for informational purposes and is not to be considered a request for quote/proposal. Solicitation Number W911S1-13-R-0001 is assigned for reference purposes. The entire solicitation will be made available on or about 17 October 2012 via the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) Acquisition to Business Website located at https://acquisition.army.mil.

All potential sources must obtain a DUNS number, a CAGE code, and register in the System for Award Management (SAM) located at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/ in order to transact business with the government. Failure to obtain a DUNS number, a CAGE code and register in the SAM may result in the delay of award of a contract or possible award to the next otherwise successful offeror.

These immunochemistry supplies are proprietary in nature and can only be obtained from the original supplier/equipment manufacturer. The MSD Sector Imager 2400 is an extremely sensitive and unique instrument for measuring constituents of the human exposome for the assessment of environmental risk and the exploration of metabolic response to environmental contaminants in humans.  The instrument relies on specific chemical formulations and disposable plates to assess biomarkers in human media including blood, breath condensate, and urine. These chemical kits are unique to the instrument, and rely on proprietary immuno-chemicals and plate configurations that are only available from the manufacturer, Meso Scale Discovery.  This study is a major component of NERL?s Exposure and Atmospheric Sciences, Methods Development and Applications Branch research. The increased focus on research studies utilizing Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) instrument Sector Imager 2400 in identifying human exposome are critical to further advance the accurate assessment of environmental risks. Increased studies are currently being conducted which would require an ongoing supply from the same source so that we can maintain continuity of our current research.
Meso Scale Discovery holds patents for the production of the proprietary Immunochemistry supplies.  It is necessary to purchase these items from the original manufacturer. Meso Scale Discovery Immunochemistry supplies have been used in previous studies conducted with this instrument and in a current study that is on-going; therefore it is critical to use Meso Scale Discovery to maintain consistency of results.  Use of other sources versus supplies from the same equipment manufacturer, would potentially render them incompatible with the MSD Instrument Sector Imager 2400 currently being used. Therefore it is critical that Immunochemistry supplies manufactured by this company be utilized.
The US EPA believes that Meso Scale Discovery is the only source capable of providing the required instrument/supplies. The circumstance permitting Other than Full and Open Competition is FAR 8.405-6 Limited Sources, ?Only one responsible source and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements?. The period of performance is expected to be begin January, 2013 with a Base Year, and Two Option Years. All interested parties who believe they can provide the required supplies should fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 10 days from the date of this announcement. 
The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any other source(s) exist; and, therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available. Consequently, any response(s) failing to provide the aforementioned data but instead choosing merely to submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will not be honored.

<DESC>Description
<p>The U.S. Department of Transportation, John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center), Cambridge, MA, intends to issue a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the development of advanced, testable solutions for the capture of mobility data. The BAA will be conducted as part of the support that the Volpe Center provides to the U.S. Department of Transportation's Dynamic Mobility Applications (DMA) Program, which is conducted by the Intelligent Transportation Systems Joint Program Office (ITS JPO). The BAA will be competed using the two-step process on a full and open basis and single or multiple awards are anticipated.<br /><br />This anticipated BAA is for research and development into new solutions to capture mobility data that will allow greater understanding of travel choices. The Volpe Center is seeking solutions that offer new capabilities for understanding multimodal travel decisions within a transportation and data environment that changes from second to second and is evolving quickly. Although the future is impossible to predict with certainty, it will likely involve greater challenges with traffic management, greater interest in multimodal transportation options, wider options in terms of data availability and modes of wireless transmission, and a greater demand and opportunity for intelligent transportation management on a user and system level.<br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541712 for this acquisition with a small business size standard of 500. The estimated announcement of the first step of this BAA will be early November 2012. Responses will be due approximately 45 days following the issuance of the BAA. The Volpe Center uses electronic commerce to issue Requests for Proposals (RFP) and amendments to RFPs. Paper copies of the RFP or amendments will not be available.

Information made available to the contractor by VA for the performance or administration of this contract or information developed by the contractor in performance or administration of the contract shall be used only for those purposes and shall not be used in any other way without the prior written agreement of the contracting officer.  This clause expressly limits the contractor's rights to use data as described in Rights in Data - General, FAR 52.227-14(d)(1).
Information generated by a Contractor as a part of the contractor's normal business operations, such as medical records created in the course of providing treatment, is subject to a review by the Office of General Counsel (OGC) to determine if the information is the property of VA and subject to VA policy.  If the information is determined by OGC to not be the property of VA, the restrictions required for VA information will not apply.
8.  MEDIA SANITIZATION
VA information will not be co-mingled with any other data on the contractors/subcontractors information systems/media storage systems in order to ensure VA requirements related to data protection and media sanitization can be met.  VA also reserves the right to conduct IT resource inspections to ensure data separation and on-site inspection of information destruction/media sanitization procedures to ensure they are in compliance with VA policy requirements.
Prior to termination or completion of this contract, contractor will not destroy information received from VA or gathered or created by the contractor in the course of performing this contract without prior written approval by the VA contracting officer.  Any data destruction done on behalf of VA by a contractor must be done in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requirements as outlined in VA Directive 6300, Records and Information Management and its Handbook 6300.1 Records Management Procedures, and applicable VA Records Control Schedules.
The contractor will receive, gather, store, back up, maintain, use, disclose and dispose of VA information only in compliance with the terms of the contract and applicable Federal and VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies.  Applicable Federal information security regulations include all Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) and Special Publications (SP) issued by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).  If Federal or VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies become applicable to the VA information or information systems after execution of the contract, or if NIST issues or updates applicable FIPS after execution of this contract, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to implement the information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies, including FIPS or SP, in this contract. 
All electronic storage media used on non-VA leased or owned IT equipment that is used to store, process, or access VA sensitive information must have all VA sensitive information removed, cleared, sanitized, or destroyed in accordance with VA policies and procedures upon:  (1) completion or termination of the contract or (2) disposal or return of the IT equipment by the contractor or any person acting on behalf of the contractor, whichever is earlier. 

Contractors are fully responsible and accountable for ensuring compliance with all HIPAA, Privacy Act, FISMA, NIST, FIPS, and VA security and privacy directives and handbooks.  The contractor security control procedures must be identical, not equivalent, to those procedures used to secure VA systems.  
Contractors collecting, storing, or disseminating personal identifiable information (PII) or protected health information (PHI) data must conform to all pertinent regulations, laws, and VA directives related to privacy.  Contractors must provide access for VA privacy reviews and assessments and provide appropriate documentation as directed.
The contractor shall not make copies of VA information except as necessary to perform the terms of the agreement or to preserve electronic information stored on contractor electronic storage media for restoration in case any electronic equipment or data used by the contractor needs to be restored to an operating state.  
If VA determines that the contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality, privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation ("FAR") part 12.
If a VHA contract is terminated for cause, the associated business associate agreement (BAA) will also be terminated and appropriate actions taken in accordance with VHA Handbook 1600.01 Business Associates.  
ALL media storing VA sensitive information outside of the VA's protected environment must have FIPS140-2 whole disk encryption.  This includes servers or PCs in the vendor's office and especially PCs at individual homes and any mobile media.  Contractor will store, transport or transmit VA sensitive information in an encrypted form, using a VA-approved encryption application that meets the requirements of NIST's FIPS 140-2 standard.  All transmissions that occur beyond the VA's protected environment must be FIPS 140-2 encrypted. 
The contractor's firewall and Web services security controls, if applicable, shall meet or exceed VA's minimum requirements. All computers used must have VA approved Firewall and Antivirus protection.   VA directives are available on the VA directives Web site at http://www1.va.gov/vapubs/. 

9.  INFORMATION SYSTEM HOSTING, OPERATION, MAINTENANCE OR USE    

For information systems that are hosted, operated, maintained, or used on behalf of VA at non-VA facilities, contractors are fully responsible and accountable for ensuring compliance with all HIPAA, Privacy Act, FISMA, NIST, FIPS, and VA security and privacy directives and handbooks.  The contractor security control procedures must be identical, not equivalent, to those procedures used to secure VA systems.  A privacy impact assessment (PIA) must also be provided to the COR and approved by VA Privacy Service prior to operational approval.  All external Internet connections involving VA information must be reviewed and approved by VA prior to implementation.

Adequate security controls for collecting, processing, transmitting, and storing of personally identifiable information, as determined by the VA Privacy Service, must be in place, tested, and approved by VA prior to hosting, operation, maintenance, or use of the information system, or systems by or on behalf of VA.  These security controls need to be stated within the PIA and supported by a risk assessment.  If these controls are determined not to be in place, or inadequate, a Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) must be submitted and approved prior to the collection of PII.
Outsourcing (contractor facility/contractor equipment/contractor staff) of systems or network operations, telecommunications services, or other managed services requires certification and accreditation (C&A) of the contractor's systems in accordance with NIST Special Publication 800-37 and VA Handbook 6500 and a privacy impact assessment of the contractor's systems prior to operation of the systems.  Government-owned (government facility/government equipment) contractor-operated systems, third party or business partner networks require a system interconnection agreement and a memorandum of understanding (MOU) which detail what data types will be shared, who will have access, and the appropriate level of security controls for all systems connected to VA networks.
The contractor must adhere to all FISMA, FIPS, and NIST standards related to the annual FISMA security controls assessment and review and update the PIA.  Any deficiencies noted during this assessment must be provided to the VA contracting officer and the information security officer (ISO) for entry into VA's Plan of Action and Milestone (POA&M) management process.  The contractor will use VA's POA&M process to document planned remedial actions to address any deficiencies in information security policies, procedures, and practices, and the completion of those activities.  Security deficiencies must be corrected within the timeframes approved by the Government.  Contractor procedures will be subject to periodic, unannounced assessments by VA officials.  The physical security aspects associated with contractor activities will also be subject to such assessments.  As updates to the system occur, an updated PIA must be submitted to the VA Privacy Service through the COR for approval.

All electronic storage media used on non-VA leased or owned IT equipment that is used to store, process, or access VA sensitive information must have all VA sensitive information removed, cleared, sanitized, or destroyed in accordance with VA policies and procedures upon:  (1) completion or termination of the contract or (2) disposal or return of the IT equipment by the contractor or any person acting on behalf of the contractor, whichever is earlier.

<DESC>Description:  NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center Jacksonville (FLCJ) is conducting a new sources sought request.  This sources sought request is to determine the availability of qualified Contractors to provide roving patrol guard services to the U.S. Navy, San Salvador, El Salvador (referred to as "the Navy" hereafter) for a one year period.  The Navy requires security to guard its personnel's homes and to respond and assist its personnel in the event of any type of accident or conflict they encounter.  The Contractor shall provide the organizational structure, management, and qualified staff at levels adequate to meet or exceed the security requirement.

The personnel assigned permanently to the government offices are required to maintain a residence in San Salvador and consequently they must live and transit through areas that are potentially dangerous due to the high level of gang activity in the country.
  Due to their association with drug interdiction missions it is feasible that they could be targeted for violence. The Department of State as well as the local Regional Security Officer classified El Salvador as a high crime threat area. The roving patrol is required to provide an additional layer of force protection and emergency response in a high threat environment.

The primary mission of the roving patrol service is to provide protection for United States Navy personnel while they are in and around their homes.  The local guards act as a quick response team to Navy personnel in the event of accidents or conflicts wherever they may be.  The roving armed patrol guard services shall prevent unauthorized access; protect life; maintain order; deter criminal attacks against employees, dependents and property.

The Contractor shall be required to utilize firearms, Guard Electronic Monitoring System (GEMS), vehicles, and establish a radio network in performing the services listed hereafter.
  

Interested firms are requested to submit a capability statement outlining their ability to October 2012 stating their business size, DUNS, and Cage Code as well as a point of contact.  The Government will use the results of this announcement to determine how subject requirement will be solicited.  The Government will not pay or provide reimbursement for any costs incurred in the preparation or delivery of the request for information.  Interested parties should send all capability statements via email to Alise.Sindab@navy,mil and erik.c.peterson@navy.mil.  

THE SUBMISSION OF THIS INFORMATION IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PROCURE ANY ITEM, NOR FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SUBMITTED OR FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING THE INFORMATION.
  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS.

<DESC>The Department of the Army, Healthcare Acquisition Activity- North intends to negotiate a Sole Source commercial item procurement with Sirona Dental Systems to provide three CAD/CAM Systems to Maxwell, McGuire, and Scott AFB. The systems will include Chair side: CEREC AC, CEREC Practice Lab Milling Unit, CEREC Club, Activation Key, Digital scanner Blocs starter set and OptiSpray, and 3D training. This proposed procurement is for supplies for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement no later than October 24th 2012 noon local time. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Point of contact Michele Devine, Contract Specialist, e-mail: michele.g.devine.ctr@us.army.mil
<p>The following verbiage is directly from the Justification and Approval for sole source and is posted in accordance with FAR 5.102(a)(6).</p>
<p>Cerec CAD/CAM Systems are the only system that mills porcelain, ceramic, leucite ceramic, composites, zirconia, acrylic, polyurethane, metal, zirconia abutments, full contour zirconia, metal and zirconia understructures, wax patterns, models and crown templates. They offer a full scale digital network for restorative procedures. The milling machine will significantly reduce fabrication time. The system allows the dentist to prepare a tooth for a complex restoration, mill the permanent crown, and cement it all in one appointment. The base currently has a CEREC system so the new system will be compatible with existing components. <br />The sole source will avoid duplication of costs that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or the unacceptable delays due to the government. Chair side intraoral scanners create digital impressions of patients teeth and sends them directly to an in-office milling machine thereby reducing fabrication time and increasing productivity.</p>

Background

The Leadership Veterans Affairs (LVA) 2012 is a year-long corporate leadership development program to develop high-performing leaders. As part of the program, the LVA Innovation Project, a VA-centric pilot program, provides participants with a unique opportunity to define and shape leadership expectations.  As problem solvers of the 21st century, LVA 2012 participants are called upon to utilize innovation and communicate a vision that drives change.  To support organization-wide initiatives LVA 2012 will lay the foundation to participate in the VA's Innovation Initiative (VAi2). 

The VA's Innovation Initiative (VAi2) is a flagship program designed to tap the talent and expertise of individuals both inside and outside government to contribute new ideas that ultimately produce new, innovative solutions that advance VA's ability to meet the challenges of becoming a 21st-century organization.

The LVA  2012 Innovation Task Force on Budget is proposing the development of an interactive Simulated Learning system focused on the Veterans Health Administration budget and Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation (VERA) process that will engage and excite staff at all levels of the organization.  Through this educational tool, VHA staff will develop a better understanding of factors that contribute to a healthier budget and build business acumen based on their Medical Center's strengths and opportunities.  Additional information on the VERA process can be found in the attached "VERA 2012 Patient Class Handbook" (attachment 0001).

Much of the VHA workforce is nave to the complexities of the budget process. While training exists, it is usually targeted only at those staff with direct responsibility for budget and planning.  However, lack of understanding can result in costly but common process errors, such as missed opportunities in vesting, poor documentation, inaccurate coding, and billing errors. The Simulated Budget tool will enable staff in various functions in the organization to simulate actions that impact budget and the VERA allocation process, and experience the outcomes of their decisions through an interactive process, much like a sophisticated video game.  

Requirements

The scope of this work effort is the development, operations, and maintenance of a Simulated Learning tool that addresses the VERA budget allocation process with support for continued enhancements to the application, as determined and approved by the Government.  Please see the Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation 2014 Patient Classification Handbook posted.  Additionally, there may be future requirements to address the Veterans Benefit Administration and National Cemetery Administration budget allocation processes.  The Contractor shall perform all activities needed to develop and support the program including: Project Management, application administration and maintenance (to include, but not limited to, defect repairs and regulatory updates to examination templates), end user support, documentation development, and DM&E.  Additionally, the Contractor shall provide support as needed to VA in response to mandates or requirements set forth by the Administration and Congress, specifically related to the tasks referenced below.  

This effort will provide the Department of Veterans Affairs, particularly the VHA, with an interactive training simulator that educates staff on building healthy VHA budgets initially focused on the Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation (VERA) process.  Additionally, it will provide immediate feedback on the results from their decisions on the long term ramifications to their VERA budget.   Specifically, this effort will:

"	Develop a translational educational tool for providers and administrative staff using a simulated learning methodology provided on an interactive, electronic "game like" platform.  
"	Develop a Simulated Budget tool will be versatile as both an educational and operational planning tool, and will include modules for clinical, administrative and leadership staff.
"	The Simulated Learning platform will be flexible enough to replicate for any Medical Center Setting, and a variety of other VA environments. 
"	The simulator will be designed in phases as future modules may be developed to address the Veterans Benefit Administration and the National Cemetery Administration budget allocation processes.

Written responses should address the following:

1.	It is requested that interested contractors submit a response (electronic submission) of no more than 10 pages in length, single spaced, 12 point font minimum that addresses the above requirement.  In response to this RFI, interested contractors shall submit the following information via email to Carol Phelan (carol.phelan@va.gov) by 3PM EST October 31, 2012. 
 
2.	Capabilities/Qualifications - Description of the capabilities/qualifications/skills your company possess to perform the work.  

3.	Teaming Arrangements - Description of Teaming Partners, Joint Ventures that your company would consider to perform the work.

If Service-Disabled or Veteran Owned Small Business, is your company and or partners certified in VA's VetBiz (www.vip.vetbiz.gov) repository?

5.	Price information - Provide your commercial price history and rough order of magnitude for the same or similar products/solutions.  

6.	Other Market Information - Provide any other relative information, however this information must be included within the 10 page limitation.

<DESC>This notice is a follow up to the original FEDBIZOPS announcement under Solicitation Number W15P7T12SANRINDUSTRYDAYNOTICE for the Airborne, Maritime, Fixed Station Joint Tactical Radio System (AMF JTRS) Program Office Small Airborne Networking Radio (SANR) Industry Days that took place in Huntsville, AL, 11-13 September 2012.
<p>Due to technical problems with the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) application, the documents linked to the October 5, 2012 change notice under Solicitation Number W15P7T12SANRINDUSTRYDAYNOTICE may not be accessible using the embedded link in that notice. As a result, the original posting of AMF JTRS SANR Industry Days Presentation Information and Responses to General Industry Questions may not have been accessible to interested parties. The originally posted information is now directly included under this solicitation notice.</p>
<p>The attached/linked PDF file includes the updated Briefing Charts and responses to various general industry questions received during the AMF JTRS SANR Industry Days event. General industry participants are hereby advised the Government has determined that it is unable to publish the aircraft photographs, and none will be provided. Industry respondents to the original RFI are hereby notified they may update their original RFI responses and/or provide additional information based upon the AMF JTRS SANR Industry Days event information contained in the attachment to this notice, or based upon information related to the one-on-one sessions. Only those companies that provided information in response to the original RFI may submit updated and/or additional information, and submittals from any other parties will not be accepted. Updated RFI responses and/or additional information shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer, Donald Morgan, at donald.w.morgan3.civ@mail.mil no later than 2:00 PM Eastern on 19 October 2012. Any information provided shall be appropriately annotated with any necessary restrictive legends, and ONLY UNCLASSIFIED INFORMATION MAY BE SUBMITTED IN RESPONSE TO THIS NOTICE.</p>
<p>In addition, during the recent SANR Industry Day, Government officials were asked about the procedures for vendors to gain access to JTRS waveform information. The officials provided the following link to access this information: http://ir-public.jpeojtrs.mil/. However, access to the JTRS Information Repository for JTRS waveform information is now available via the following link: https://ir-registration.sd.spawar.navy.mil, and the previous link should no longer be used. The current link requires client side PKI certificate, which must be issued by a DoD trusted source (CAC card or DoD ECA vendor). Neither the contracting office or the AMF JTRS Program Office are able to provide any further information concerning access to the JTRS Information Repository.</p>

<DESC><strong>THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE.</strong> This is a Special Notice that includes a Request for submission of Statement of Capability (SOC) addressing the capability to provide Oracle Support for Business Systems Modernization-Energy (BSM-E) ENTERPRISE. This Special Notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Quote (RFQ) or Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFQ or RFP in the future. This SOC does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. The information provided in the SOC is subject to change and is not binding on the Government.
<p>The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals for the work described in the attached documents. Responders are advised that the DLA will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this SOC.</p>
<p><br />REQUEST FOR STATEMENT OF CAPABILITIES (SOC)</p>
<p>The purpose of issuing this Statement of Capabilities (SOC) under SP4706-13-SOC-BSME-DCSOE is to identify potential contractors and assess their capability to provide Information Technology (IT) services for maintenance of operational capabilities and sustainment of all areas of the Business Systems Modernization-Energy (BSM-E) Enterprise Level System as well as project management, database administration, product upgrades, infrastructure and configuration management, application maintenance, 24x7 On-Call Support, Tier 2 helpdesk support, testing, System Change Requests (SCRs), and Information Assurance (IA) system security of BSM-E Enterprise Level System to support DLA Energy. The BSM-E Enterprise Level System consists of Oil Enterprise Downstream (OED/OEDA), Reporting Data Store (RDS), Oracle Government Financials (OGF), Discoverer, Redwood Cronacle Enterprise Job Scheduling Software applications and Locally-Developed Products and Extensions that provide additional functionality.<br />The Performance Work Statement entitled: "Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Information Operation at Fort Belvoir Operational and Sustainment Support of the Business System Modernization - Energy (BSM-E) Enterprise Level System" is provided for information and reference in order to facilitate the ability to respond to the SOC response areas detailed below (see atttached PWS)</p>
<p>1. Provide a brief narrative discussing your capability to provide Information Technology (IT) services for maintenance of operational capabilities and sustainment for the BSM-E Enterprise Level System based on OED Version 6, a software application used exclusively and solely by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) worldwide within the BSM-E system of systems. The narrative discussion shall address the capability to provide maintenance and sustainment without OED having the benefit of a product support organization upon which to rely as an informational and training resource; with OED code "wrapping" and inaccessibility which prohibits making changes to the code; the complexity of the BSM-E Enterprise Level System architecture which requires the movement of data between multiple databases based on a proprietary data transfer framework [Replicated File System (RFS), Workgroups, and sequence numbers]; the necessity to create data manipulation scripts to provide work arounds to OED "bugs' and limitations; and maintaining the more than one-thousand Redwood jobs performed in the daily and nightly schedule runs. The narrative shall set forth an implementation plan for maintenance and sustainment highlighting and detailing resources, experience, knowledge, certifications, and past performance as it relates to a world-wide enterprise information technology system for commodity management and financial accountability.</p>
<p>2. Provide a brief narrative discussing your capability to provide Information Technology (IT) services for maintenance of operational capabilities and sustainment of the BSM-E Enterprise Level System based on the knowledge, experience and the ability to interpret DOD Policy, Manuals and Instructions; DLA-specific Policy, Manuals and Instructions; DLA Energy Business Rules, processes, procedures and regulations for standard accounting policy and procedures; and the application of these policies while performing efforts which facilitate and support the operation and sustainment of the BSM-E Enterprise Level System. The narrative shall demonstrate possession of the required knowledge and experience, and provide examples of the application of this knowledge and experience via the business accounting and inventory functions as it relates to DLA's system of record for DLA Energy's financial and inventory data. Additionally the narrative shall describe and demonstrate the capability to leverage existing legacy and up-to-the-minute subject matter expertise. In order to perform this effort, the capability to provide subject matter expertise regarding the BSM-E Enterprise Level System to contractors supporting Energy Convergence is paramount along with providing recommendations and alternatives to DLA Energy personnel regarding conversion to Energy Convergence and daily operational maintenance and sustainment efforts.</p>
<p>3. Provide a brief narrative discussing your capability to provide Information Technology (IT) services for maintenance of operational capabilities and sustainment of the BSM-E Enterprise Level System based on code that has been locally developed around various COTS applications which are at the "heart" of the BSM-E Enterprise Level System. The narrative discussion shall address the capability to provide maintenance and sustainment of locally developed code that has increased in size and criticality as a result of added functionality which consist of products and extensions listed in Section 3.5 of the PWS, changes to the COTS application interfaces, report development and report changes, and bug fixes within OED that due to code "wrapping and inaccessibility require new data entry screens or processes in the BSM-E Web Portal as well as changes required due to Energy Convergence rollouts by geographical areas. The extensions, consisting of 2.6 million lines of code, contain complex business rules and require the sustainment and maintenance of these business rules. The narrative shall demonstrate a plan for maintenance and support to troubleshoot technical and functional issues, recommendations and alternatives on proposed business processes and/or system defect workarounds, code development and maintenance of existing code that interfaces with OED, development of specifications, development of test documentation and training guides, and maintenance of code required as a result of changes in network architecture.</p>
<p>4. Provide responses to the SOC response area detailed above based on the following required formatting:<br />a. Four pages or less for each question<br />b. Times New Roman 12 Point Type<br />c. White space and conventional paragraphing are required for readability</p>
<p>Please see the attached Performance Work Statement (PWS) for requirements:<br />The deadline for submission is Not-Later-Than (NLT) October 24, 2012 at 0600 P.M. Eastern Time.<br /><br />The Contractors' SOC must include their Company Cage Code, TIN, DUNS number, and Point of Contact Information. <br /><br /><br />Primary Point of Contact: <br />Twyla Jackson,<br />Contract Specialist<br />twyla.jackson@dla.mil<br />Phone: 7037671174</p>

  (2)  The Contractor?s CAGE code is in the SAM database; and 
  (3)  The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record ?Active?. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process. <BR> <BR>?System for Award Management (SAM)? means the primary Government repository for prospective federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance related processes.

  (2)  The SAM registration shall be for the same name and address identified on the contract, with its associated CAGE code and DUNS or DUNS+4.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(g)(1)(i)  If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name with a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to?

   (2)  The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.  Information provided to the Contractor?s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 
(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

POC: SFC DeLeon Kelly, (760) 380-3693 <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

Hunter (760) 360-3693. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<DESC>The Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-296) states that Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science &amp; Technology Directorate (S&amp;T) will "support basic and applied homeland security research to promote revolutionary changes in technologies; advance the development, testing and evaluation, and deployment of critical homeland security technologies; and accelerate the prototyping and deployment of technologies that would address homeland security vulnerabilities." Pursuant to this mission, DHS S&amp;T's Explosives Division (EXD) recognizes the need for state-of-the-art passenger screening at checkpoints that shall have the capability to screen passengers' extempt liquids and gels for the presence of liquid explosives and flammable liquids (pure or mixed with fuel). The Advanced Bottled Liquid Scanner (BLS) effort is intended to satisfy this requirement.
<p>This BAA sets forth the requirements to accomplish a variety of specific tasks related to the development of screening technologies for passenger carry-on bottled liquids and gels at the passenger checkpoint. The identified requirements presented here have a direct impact on meeting the requirements outlined in the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001, Public Law 107-71.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<DESC>Mission (Test) Support Services, U.S. Army Yuma Proving Ground, AZ<br><br>Invitation for Industry Comments re draft Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) and Performance Requirements Summary (PRS).<br><br>The Mission and Installation Contracting Command - Yuma Proving Ground (MICC - YPG) has a requirement for Mission (Test) Support Services (MTSS) at U.S. Army Yuma Proving Ground, AZ (USAYPG). This Request for Information (RFI) is for market research and acquisition strategy planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of MICC -YPG. The purpose of this notice is to solicit industry feedback relative to various aspects of the proposed contract effort and its associated documentation.  The services anticipated for this effort may include, but not be limited to the following functions:<br><br>Electronic Instrumentation Operation<br>Optical and Geodetic Instrumentation Operation<br>Metrology and Simulation Operation<br>Computation and Automation<br>Test Operation and Maintenance Support<br>Range Management Operations<br>Technical and Engineering Special Services<br>Range Communication Operations<br>Information Management Operations<br>Data Management and Test Coordination<br><br>A Draft Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) with Attachments 1-12 and a draft Performance Requirements Summary (PRS) are provided for reference and industry comment and are subject to change.<br><br>Information Sought:<br><br>(1)  Please provide feedback on areas within the QASP that, in your opinion, have an overall positive and/or negative impact on the process of evaluating contractor performance (i.e. performance objectives, evaluation process, surveillance procedures, performance rating definitions, etc).   Are there any areas which appear unduly burdensome to either the Government or the Contractor towards the goal of achieving superior Contractor performance or counter-productive to surveillance goals and objectives in general.  <br><br>(2)  Monthly performance assessments are compiled using several different methods of data capture.  One such area of assessment is a Customer Feedback/Satisfaction inspection which inputs to YTC's Contractor Rating Database (See Attachment 2).  This inspection consists of four elements with associated percentages (1) Efficiency 35%; (2) Technical Adequacy 45%; (3) Responsiveness 10%; and (4) Feedback/Liaison 10%.   Are these elements good indicators for achieving superior contractor performance, and if not, please provide feedback on alternative elements which could be targeted to continuously drive an optimum test support response?  <br><br>(3)  The performance objectives of the attached Performance Requirements Summary (PRS) are considered to be major elements for successful execution of the contract.  Based on corporate experience of similar contracts, for this type of mission (test) support services, are the objectives listed consistent with this type of service or are there additional objectives which could/should be assessed to ensure optimal performance of the contractor?<br><br>(4)   What type of contractor incentives would be appropriate for the Mission (Test) Support Services requirement, in a potential cost-plus incentive fee type contract environment?<br><br>(5)  Please provide feedback on what motivates a contractor's performance in a highly dynamic test arena and the potential risk, if any, of each motivator, and to whom? <br><br>(6)  Please provide suggested surveillance methods, incentives, and/or any other feedback you deem appropriate with regards to these topics.<br><br>The MICC - YPG does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses, nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted, nor will respondents be notified of the MICC - YPG's review of the information received. The information obtained from the RFI will be utilized as market research for consideration in development of the Acquisition Strategy/Plan for this requirement. Interested sources shall provide all feedback in writing no later than 5:00 PM MST, 12 January 2012.<br>

<DESC>Under Amendment 1, DARPA-BAA-12-61 ADAPTable Sensor Systems Phase 2 is amended to state that DARPA is interested in an ancillary RF hardware module (SDR Daughtercard) that would facilitate experiments with a number of different waveforms and protocols such as femtocellular base stations, SRW and WNaN. The module should contain a microprocessor with a real-time operating system to support higher-level MAC functions, an FPGA to support lower level Physical and Link layer functions, and 4 RF transceivers. The RF transceivers should support variable bandwidth up to 40 MHz and be capable of tuning over the range from 70MHz to 6GHz (e.g., AD9361). Application specific RF functions (e.g., Power amplifiers, filters, and switching circuitry should be included in a separate solder-down module so that each application may have optimized RF performance. A minimum of 100k logic elements is needed to support the number and sophistication of waveform and a high performance processor (e.g., OMAP 3725) should be used.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source synopsized below on 17 October 2012.
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Acquisition Management (OAM), on behalf of the Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP), intends to negotiate another follow-on extension of services on a firm-fixed price, sole source basis.  A modification to extend support services to MacFadden & Associates, Inc. (MacFadden) of 8403 Colesville Road, Ste 400, Silver Spring, MD 20910-4032, performed under task order number EP08H002296 and issued against MacFadden's General Services Administration schedule contract number GS-35F-4713G, will be processed under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(A) and (C).  The sole source extension is in the interest of economy and efficiency, and the new work is a logical follow-on to the original Federal Supply Schedule order given that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order was not previously issued under sole-source o r limited-sources procedures.  Additionally, an urgent and compelling need exists as following the standard competitive Federal Supply Schedule procedures would cause unacceptable delays in the EPA's ability to meet the accelerated registration requirements mandated by Congress under the Pesticide Registration Improvement Act (PRIA).
The referenced contract task order was originally scheduled to expire on 31 August 2012.  The task order was modified to extend the performance period to 31 October 2012 in accordance with the Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source synopsis posted on 25 July 2012 and as provided below.  A new contract task order will not be awarded by the current expiration date.  A gap in service under the referenced contract task order is unacceptable to the EPA.  The sole source award will help to continue the ongoing regular operation of the Document and Data Management Support (DDMS) operations and to ensure that costs, resources, and activities are managed appropriately.  In order to avoid a gap in service, EPA intends to award a three (3) month extension of the current contract task order until a competitive contract can be awarded by 31 January 2013.
The modification is for non-personal services to be extended on MacFadden's referenced contract task order.  The task order was awarded competitively on 1 September 2008.  The modification to extend services for the additional three (3) month period is valued at $508,065.51. The same level of services will be provided by MacFadden in accordance with the contract task order Performance Work Statement.  Under the current task order, MacFadden provides services to the OPP, including extraction of information about pesticide studies, analyses of the records resulting from the decision processes, and the capture of data supporting regulatory applications.  MacFadden has the experience to address the follow-on requirement to meet the PRIA mandated accelerated regulatory schedule and the necessary expertise and knowledge of the pesticide label process.
THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE MODIFICATION FOR FOLLOW-ON WORK UNDER THE REFERENCED CONTRACT TASK ORDER.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  NO SOLICITATION FOR THE THREE (3) MONTH FOLLOW-ON EXTENSION WILL BE PROVIDED.  The determination not to compete this proposed contract action is solely in the discretion of the EPA.  The EPA will not be responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this notice.  This notice in no way obligates the EPA to award the three (3) month follow-on extension of services, sole source modification to the subject contract task order.
Interested parties must provide evidence of their capability to fulfill this requirement no later than 29 October 2012 by 10:00 AM ET to Stefan Martiyan, Contracting Officer, via email at martiyan.stefan@epa.gov.  A draft Performance Work Statement is provided at http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/pcsc/DDMSLUIS/index.htm.  Responses to this notice must demonstrate evidence that clearly and convincingly demonstrates that competition of the three (3) month extension of services would be advantageous to the Government and would not hinder EPA mission objectives.
END of Notice.

<DESC>*** THIS IS NOT AN INVITATION FOR BID OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL ***
<p>The Jacksonville District Corps of Engineers will hold a Pre-Proposal Teleconference on Wednesday, October 31, 2012, at 1:00 PM, EST regarding the Mile Point Training Wall Reconfiguration Project. The purpose of this teleconference is to discuss with industry the means and methods that prospective offerors may utilize to accomplish the construction of the training wall reconfiguration (see "Items for Discussion" section of this notice for details) as well as discuss any questions, concerns or comments industry may have regarding the DRAFT solicitation. The DRAFT solicitation is available for download. It is requested that all participants review the DRAFT solicitation and submit proposed means and methods as well as any specific questions, comments, or concerns in writing via e-mail by close of business on October 26, 2012, to Beau.Corbett@us.army.mil. This will allow the technical team time to review industry submissions prior to the teleconference. Any information that is considered proprietary should be marked accordingly to alert Government personnel as to what can and cannot be released or discussed publicly without the prospective offeror's permission. The teleconference will begin with Jacksonville District personnel responding to industry questions, comments and concerns. An open discussion period will follow and any additional issues may be presented at that time.</p>
<p>The toll free dial in number for this teleconference is: (888) 830-6260 and the participant access code is 768759. The total number of available incoming phone lines is limited; therefore, it is requested that each firm utilize a minimum number of lines (preferably only one or two) for those individuals participating. The web meeting address for this conference is: https://www.webmeeting.att.com and the participant access code is 768759. The first time you use the Web Meeting Service, you will need to download the client software. Web Meeting help and software downloads can be found at: https://www.webmeeting.att.com<br />In order to prepare, in advance, a list of attendees of individuals participating in this teleconference, it is requested that an e-mail be sent to Beau.Corbett@us.army.mil with the following information: (1) name and address of your firm; (2) the total number of phone lines your firm will be using; (3) name and title of each individual participating; and (4) their telephone number and e-mail address. Please include a statement in this e-mail indicating whether or not the Jacksonville District may include this information when posting and/or distributing the list of attendees.</p>
<p>When the DRAFT solicitation has been finalized it will be synopsized and advertised under a standard Request for Proposal (RFP) number such as: W912EP-13-R-00XX.</p>
<p>Potential offerors and subcontractors are encouraged to register on the Federal Business Opportunities website as Interested Vendors for this special notice to take full advantage of networking opportunities.</p>
<p>The Jacksonville Harbor (Mile Point) Navigation Study Final Integrated Feasibility Report and Environmental Assessment will be posted to the link below for informational purposes.<br />http://www.saj.usace.army.mil/Missions/CivilWorks/Navigation/NavigationProjects/JacksonvilleHaborMilePoint.aspx</p>
<p>Items for Discussion at Pre-Solicitation Teleconference<br />&bull; Construction Sequencing (prescribed order of work items and ideas about how the work will proceed)<br />&bull; Deconstruction of existing training wall and the processing of material for reuse<br />&bull; Work during strong tides/dynamic environment <br />&bull; Staging/Stockpiling/Processing requirements - sufficient space on Helen Cooper Park?<br />&bull; Temporary Containment features (prescribed-geotextile tubes vs. performance-met environmental and containment requirements)<br />&bull; Return water system (low spots on southern containment and/or through west wall?)<br />&bull; Structure foundation through scour holes (bags, tubes, riprap, sand?)<br />&bull; Concrete Structural Units (CSU) ideas (should we provide a default stone structure in addition?)<br />o Proposed training wall systems will need to promote tidal exchanges hydrating and draining the new salt marsh, and should also promote favorable oyster and fish habitat deliveries for a 3.9 Foot mean tide range using openings or windows. The systems will be required to resist loads for final dredge material placed at elevation +4 Feet MLLW with a base elevation at -2.5 Feet MLLW, while resisting overturning and sliding for described conditions. Approximate dredge slurry maximum elevation may achieve +4 Feet MLLW. Maximum river current velocity is 5 Feet/Second. Systems must deliver shoreline protection for wind and wave conditions with a design wave height of 5 Feet. Top of structure is required at elevation of not less than +7.5 Feet MLLW. The proposed system should be expected to perform with minimum operational maintenance and repair, and should remain structurally stable for a service period of 75 to 100 years.<br />&bull; Containment features behind the west training leg. (marine mattresses laying on the backs of the CSU's or geotextile tubes behind the CSU's, etc...) Would CSU manufacturers be comfortable having those earth pressures on their structures if we use marine mattresses, or the CSU may not have a flat face conducive for laying a marine mattress against?</p>

<DESC>**PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE POSTED 17 OCT 2012; HSCG84-13-R-BB8031**<br /><br />This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE (not a pre-solicitation notice pursuant to FAR Part 5) to determine the capability of potential sources and the availability of commercial sources pursuant to FAR Part 10.
<p>This notice is issued by the U.S. Coast Guard Shore Infrastructure Logistics Center, Norfolk, VA to identify sources capable of providing all labor, materials, equipment, and personnel necessary to support U.S. Coast Guard Air Station Houston (ASH) unit-specific aviation training program.</p>
<p>The contractor will be responsible for providing and operating a vessel in support of the U.S. Coast Guard Air Station Houston (ASH) unit-specific aviation training program. <br />As such, the contractor shall provide a vessel and all necessary management supervision, personnel, labor materials, fuel and equipment required for supporting helicopter crew hoists, rescue swimmer operations, and any aerial delivered material used to fulfill the Air Station's training requirements. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. The U.S. Coast Guard anticipates soliciting and awarding a contract for a base plus four option years, if exercised by the Government, beginning upon award.</p>
<p>ASH is located at the Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base in Houston, Texas; however all work will be completed in the general vicinity of the Western and Northwestern portions of Galveston Bay. The area of operations will be located within an area bound to the north by Morgan's Point, south to Eagle Point, and east to the Houston Ship channel; with the majority of operations being conducted within 5 NM from the entrance to the Kemah Channel and occasionally Clear Lake.</p>
<p>The contractor will normally be available for training each Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday for a total of 4 hours each day (or 12 hours of training time each week). Operations will be conducted every Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday between the hours of 0900 and 1300 OR 1 hour before sunset until 3 hours after sunset.</p>
<p>Vessel Description: <br />The vessel shall be similar to the Coast Guard's 41' Utility Boat (UTB) or 45' Response Boat Medium (RB-M). The vessel should be capable of maneuvering and operating as a stable platform at idle and or low speeds and therefore should be of the displacement hull type. Similar to the 41' UTB, the contract vessel should be no smaller than 30 feet and no greater than 50 feet in length. The vessel's beam shall be no less than 10 feet and no greater than 20 feet. Mast must have no permanent structures protruding higher than 25 feet above the water line which cannot be quickly stowed or folded (e.g. antennas) prior to commencing operations. Gross vessel weight shall be 8 tons minimum. The vessel should have a cabin large enough to accommodate the entire crew if necessary. The vessel shall be capable of easily and quickly recovering personnel from the water (routine recovery of helicopter rescue swimmers or rescue of aircrew) and operating in an adverse weather environment.</p>
<p>Other Characteristics: Minimum speed is 0 knots (dead in the water) and able to maintain up to 10 knots for at least 3 hours. Ideal vessel speed for training is approximately 5-10 knots for a period of 1 hour. Vessel must be capable of maintaining a heading of + / - 10 degrees while operating under a Short Range Rescue (SRR) MH-65 helicopter producing an average peak velocity of 90 knots of rotor downwash in varying sea states and winds depending on site. An extremely shallow draft vessel is undesirable due to drift characteristics when subjected to rotor downwash; draft shall be between 3 to 6 feet.</p>
<p>Required Deck Area: Similar to the 41' UTB and the 45' RB-M, the minimum deck area should be at least 60 sq. ft on the aft fantail portion of the vessel, to allow a minimum of two crew members to safely conduct hoist operations. Deck area must be free of all obstructions, and must have no permanent structures protruding higher than 20 feet above the water line which cannot be quickly stowed or folded (e.g. antennas).</p>
<p>Vessel Equipment: At a minimum the vessel shall have all equipment required by law including, but not limited to: an operating depth sounder, VHF-FM (multiple frequency capable) two-way marine radio, a cell phone for secondary communications with the ASH Operations Center (713-578-3006), GPS, and a long distance high beam search light.</p>
<p>Safety Equipment: The vessel shall be outfitted with a contractor furnished first aid kit and USCG approved Type III Personal Flotation Devices for all crew and passengers carried aboard. Personal protective equipment, foul weather gear, and survival suits shall be provided by the contractor and worn as needed by crew members allowing them to operate safely on deck and under rotor downwash continuously in temperatures ranging from 0&deg; C to 43&deg; C (32&deg; F to 110&deg; F). The contractor shall provide helmets, gloves, goggles, and grounding rods for use by crewmembers during helicopter operations. All equipment shall be used in accordance with and be of the same type or better as listed in the USCG Rescue and Survival Systems Manual, COMDTINST M10470.10F and the USCG Boat Crew Seamanship Manual, COMDTINST M16114.5C. These manuals can be found online at http://www.uscg.mil/directives/.</p>
<p>A solicitation is anticipated to be issued shortly and will be synopsized on the FedBizOpps Electronic Posting System at www.fedbizopps.gov. It is the potential offer's responsibility to monitor this avenue for release of any future solicitation or synopsis.</p>
<p>The applicable NAICS Code is 488390 (Other Support Services for Water Transportation) with a size standard of $35.5 million.

<DESC>SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
<p>The following document is prepared in accordance with FAR 6.301 and FAC 97-02, October 10, 2012, (6.303). Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements:</p>
<p>1) Identification of the agency and the contracting activity:<br />Udall Foundation <br />U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution<br />130 S. Scott Ave.<br />Tucson, AZ 85701</p>
<p>2) Nature and/or description of action being approved:<br />Request to sole source contract with California State University (CSU) to mediate/facilitate the 3rd year of the Sierra Cascades Dialog Project, a multi-stakeholder forum that meets four times a year in the Sacramento, California area.</p>
<p>3) A description of supplies of services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value):</p>
<p>The Sierra Cascades Dialogue Group (SCD) consists of a broad range of stakeholders with an interest in the Sierra Nevada Range including the National Forests located within Region 5 of the Forest Service. The SCD convenes four times a year to discuss critical issues that have caused conflicts in forest planning and that affect people who live, work and recreate in the Region 5 National Forests. The intent of the dialogs is to hold regular conversations among engaged stakeholders to achieve agreements and understanding that will inform Forest Service decisions. Outcomes are shared with the Regional Leadership Team and other staff of the Forest Service.</p>
<p>The Forest Service has requested the services of the Udall Foundation to provide neutral third party facilitation for this project for the 2013 calendar year (total of four dialog meetings). Services include meeting facilitation, preparation and agenda design with the SCD multi-stakeholder steering committee, logistical preparation for an average of 150 participants per meeting, and documentation of the meetings and steering committee calls. The total value for these services, including the venue costs, is $119,016.</p>
<p>4) An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition:<br />Other than full and open competition is authorized by FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) because there is "only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."</p>
<p>5) A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires the use of the authority cited:</p>
<p>&bull; CSU assigned to the project Gina Bartlett who has designed and executed seven previous meetings for the SCD between June 2010-September 2012. This contractor has performed very highly by meeting the contract objectives and completing all work on time and within budget.</p>
<p>&bull; Gina Bartlett has built relationships and trust with the SCD stakeholders through this process and has a high amount of credibility among a wide range of stakeholders for her neutrality and working fairly and effectively with known parties within this stakeholder group. <br /><br />&bull; Gina Bartlett is located within geographic proximity of this project. Through her history of work in the Sierra Cascades area and within this process she has gained extensive knowledge of the geographic area and key forest issues the group is working together on.</p>
<p>&bull; The Sierra Cascades Dialogue Steering Committee, consisting of a range of stakeholders that represent the region, have requested the Udall Foundation to continue with CSU and Gina Bartlett as the neutral facilitator to maintain consistency and not cause disruptions in the project that may affect their success.</p>
<p>&bull; Gina Bartlett is a member of the Udall Foundation's National Roster of ECR practitioners</p>
<p>6) A description of the efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many sources as is practical, including whether a CBD notice was or will be publicized as required in Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies:</p>
<p>5.202 - The contracting officer need not submit the notice required by 5.201 when (a)(2) The proposed contract action is made under the conditions described in 6.302-2 (see #4)</p>
<p>7) A determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable:</p>
<p>&bull; Gina Bartlett's hourly rate is $188/hr which is within the middle range of rates on the ECR National Roster of ECR Practitioners. A survey of the rates charged by other roster members in the Sacramento/Bay Area of California revealed rates ranging from $160 to $220 per hour.<br />&bull; The cost for the 2012 Dialogs was contracted for $90,864.43 which was determined to be fair and reasonable compared to contracts awarded by the Udall Foundation for similar services. The price quoted for 2013 is within range of this estimate. The price increase for 2013 to $119,016.38 is due to the following:<br />o Increase in venue costs due to the new location that will accommodate more people and has access to necessary technology<br />o New audio/visual costs to accommodate webcasting of meetings and needed equipment<br />o Additional hours for Gina Bartlett based on the needs of 2012 to manage the SCD project. Also the January Meeting for 2013 will be a two-day meeting whereas all meetings in 2012 were 1 day meetings.</p>
<p>8) A description of the market survey conducted (Sec. 7.101) and the results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted:</p>
<p>A market survey was not conducted due to the fact that the Forest Service and the SCD steering committee has specifically requested this contractor.</p>
<p>9) Other factors supporting the use of other than full and open competition:</p>
<p>Gina Bartlett has extensive knowledge from the previous years that is directly applicable to the 2013 Dialogs. With this knowledge, she is able to design agendas and logistics based on what has worked or not worked in the past and also is able to move discussions forward from previous Dialog meetings. A considerable amount of time and money would need to be invested to bring another contractor up to speed to operate at the same capacity, including a stakeholder assessment that would be estimated in the $15,000 - $30,000 range.</p>
<p>10) Listings of any sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition:<br />None</p>
<p>11) Statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the services require:</p>
<p>None</p>
<p>12) Certification</p>

<DESC><p align="left">The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of River Protection (ORP) intends to award a firm fixed price modification to Contract Number DE-EM0002103, by means other than full and open competition. DOE-ORP intends to award a sole source contract modification to Energy Solutions, LLC, located at 6100 Chevy Chase Drive, Laurel, MD, 20707.</p>
<p align="left">Work associated with Modification 002 will support development of the vitrification process for the Hanford Tank Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP). The WTP is expected to treat both High-Level Waste (HLW) and Low-Activity Waste (LAW).</p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin: 0pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><strong></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin: 0pt; mso-outline-level: 1;">This effort is for the procurement of services to (1) develop enhanced Low Activity Waste (LAW) glass property-composition models, by performing melter tests to define limiting concentrations of halides and other minor components, and (2) enhance High Level Waste (HLW) glass property-composition models by performing melter tests to define High Waste Loading Glass Formulations for High-Cr HLW and establish limitations of direct feeding of the HLW Facility.<br /><br />Competition Exception:&nbsp; DOE-ORP has determined that this requirement can only be satisfied by the unique services offered by Energy Solutions, LLC. The statutory authority permitting this action is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), where a determination has been made that the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Energy Solutions, LLC, through its exclusive agreement with Catholic University of America (CUA), Vitreous State Laboratory (VSL), is the only firm that is uniquely capable of providing the technical expertise and facilities necessary to complete the tasks described above.&nbsp; These tasks will be performed at the glass development laboratory and melter test facility at CUAVSL, in Washington, D.C. Performance of these tasks requires the use of a DM100 melter, which resides at CUA-VSL, and expertise with LAW/HLW glass composition models. Energy Solutions, LLC, is the only source with the required equipment and technical expertise to perform the work in the required time frame.<br /><br />Unsolicited Proposals: All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the agency.<br /><br />The estimated amount for this effort is less than $3,500,000.00.<br /><br />This effort is not set-aside.</p>

<DESC>ICE is procuring iOS services from various cellular carriers via Apple iPhone devices bundled into monthly plans for cellular phone service, Internet access for domestic and international coverage, and text messaging capabilities. The devices provide critical, mission support services for ICE personnel and provide modern communication and personal computing services. Examples are: call waiting, call forwarding, three way calling, caller ID, voice mail messaging, geospatial services, and picture/video capabilities. The iOS services will be used by a variety of agency personnel, including, but not limited to, Homeland Security Investigations, Enforcement and Removal Operations, and Office of the Principal Legal Advisor employees. The iPhone services will allow these individuals to leverage reliable, mobile technology on a secure and manageable platform in furtherance of the agency's mission.
<p>ICE is intends on procuring the iOS-based devices/iPhone services for 17,676 users.</p>
<p>The salient characteristics and critical functions required by ICE for mobile technology services are as follows:<br />Attribute Utility<br />Commercial Viability Services must be derived from a commercial product that has significant market share to ensure product enhancement, support, and interest by third-party vendors to spur innovation and utility.<br />Operating System modification detection Ensures uniform deployment and identifies security threats.<br />Product uniformity and predictability Ensures supportability, training, and security management<br />Voice and data communication support Basic need for a mobile communications device.<br />Digital certificate and Identities management Ensure unique identity of device and end user for secure operations.<br />Email and Directory service support Basic need for mobile computing.<br />Microsoft Exchange integration with ActiveSync Ensures proper integration with ICE's enterprise messaging infrastructure.<br />Virtual Private Network support Basic need for secure communications with mission applications.<br />Remote management capabilities Supports field users and ensures consistent operational posture of the device.<br />Device use and operating characteristics managed using centralized policy management and manual configuration Essential for secure and consistent operations. Enforces agency standards for service use.<br />Secure backup of device data and configuration support Basic need to support reliability, repair, and end user support<br />Managed application distribution Basic need for consistent delivery of services and security.<br />Application development tools Needed to develop custom mission support applications. Promotes commercial viability of services and devices.<br />Signed application enforcement Ensures applications on device are from legitimate source and/or meet agency policy controls.</p>
<p>Business Requirements</p>
<p>&bull; Training and Standards of Conduct - In coordination with the ICE Office of Training and Development (OTD) and the ICE Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR), establish and provide training on the use of mobile computing devices that are enforced using the operating system policy that can be remotely managed and monitored.<br />&bull; Promote the use and standardization of commercially established mobile and web-based applications for mobile computing.<br />&bull; Identify scanning capabilities for the mobile computing environment needed to support the ICE missions (either built-in, or as an accessory add-on for ICE law enforcement (LE) and non-LE use). Examples include:<br />o LE - biometrics fingerprint and retina scanning for immediate identification of an individual<br />o LE - biometrics for facial recognition identification of an individual<br />o LE - scanning of data card magnetic strips and embedded chips for LE purposes (e.g., state drivers licenses and ID cards; passports and other type of cards such as debit cards requiring magnetic strip scanning)<br />o LE - other TBD <br />o Non-LE - barcode scanning for property/inventory management <br />&bull; Product consistency and uniformity simplify management and training. Products used by enterprises must balance the pace of innovation with the ability of the organization to adapt to those changes. ICE's paramount need for security and maintainability presents unique challenges that many consumer-oriented products ignore due to the complexity of implementation and low returns on investment.</p>
