No partial shipments are permitted, unless otherwise specified by Contracting Officer at time of award.<BR><BR>(a) The provider of information technology shall certify applications are fully functional and operate correctly as intended on systems using the Federal Desktop Core Configuration (FDCC). This includes Internet Explorer 7 configured to operate on Windows XP and Vista (in Protected Mode on Vista). For the Windows XP settings, see http://csrc.nist.gov/itsec/guidance_WinXP.html and for the Windows Vista settings, see: http://csrc.nist.gov/itsec/guidance_vista.html.(b) The standard installation, operation, maintenance, update, and/or patching of software shall not alter the configuration settings from the approved FDCC configuration. The information technology should also use the Windows Installer Service for installation to the default program files directory and should be able to silently install and uninstall.(c) Applications designed for normal end users shall run in the standard user context without elevated system administration privileges.(d) The Department of State currently intends to use Vista in Protected Mode in the future when all devices at all worldwide locations have sufficient capacity to permit an upgrade from the XP operating system.<BR><BR>The Contractor and its employees shall exercise the utmost discretion in regard to all matters relating to their duties and functions. They shall not communicate to any person any information known to them by reason of their performance of services under this contract which has not been made public, except in the necessary performance of their duties or upon written authorization of the Contracting Officer.  All documents and records (including photographs) generated during the performance of work under this contract shall be for the sole use and become the exclusive property of the U.S Government. Furthermore, no article, book, pamphlet, email, recording, broadcast, speech television appearance, film or photograph concerning any aspect of work performed under this contract shall be published or disseminated through any media without the prior written authorization of the Contracting Officer. These obligations do no cease upon the expiration or termination of this contract.  The Contractor shall include the substance of this provision in all contracts of employment and in all subcontracts hereunder.<BR><BR>CA/CST/ES owns and has in use several IBM servers.  These IBM servers are used to support projects throughout the Washington Metropolitan Area. The warranties already have or are about to expire; however, they are still in use and are an essential part to CA/CST/ES.  By extending the warranty and reinstating the equipment, CA can ensure that IBM will provide hardware and software troubleshooting after business hours or over the weekend, followed by on-site service and parts when necessary. The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the services identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system.
Due to CAs investment and overall satisfaction with IBM servers and the service IBM provides, it would be counter-productive and unnecessarily costly to attempt to identify, acquire, and install new hardware and new services at this time, assuming that an alternative could be found that offers identical functionality and ease of use.  CA/CST believes that it is critical to the ongoing operation of Consular Systems to continue service for the IBM servers.  Because this service has already been successfully used, CA/CST believes that it is in the Governments best overall interests to procure and use this particular product.The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.<BR><BR>

The Department of State, Office of Acquisition (NLMJAQMJIP/GPB),intends to award a GSA Task Order Contract to a GSA vendor provider ofNetApp Storage Appliances and Support on behalf of European andEurasian Affairs Bureau (EURlIOJEX). Thc estimated cost is $197,942.91.2. The Department of State, Office of Acquisitions is conducting this acquisitionfor the European and Eurasian Affairs Bureau (EURlIOJEX). Under thisprocurement, NetApp Storage Appliance and Support will be solicited onFEDHID, limited to name brand only and GSA Schedule holders.3. The successful GSA vendor will provide the following NetApp StorageEquipment and Services:ADP Acquisitions SUI' Services-CIFS Software; ADP Acquisitions SUPServices-Kit; Documents 2020; SW Base Pack; Power Cable North America;DS14MK4 Shelf ACPS 14x300GB 15k HDD ESH4; 36 Months Service;FAS2020 Disk Shelf 12x4450 SAS; SFP optical, LC/LC SM X; RackmountKit 4N2 DS14-Middle; GSA Fee; FAS2020 Disk Shelf I2x300GB SAS;Support edgc Premium 7x24 4hr onsite; SW Application Pack TI; FAS2020Base Appliance; SW Foundation Pack '1'1.4. IAW FAR 8.405-6, citing 40 U.S.C. 50 I , Limited sources justification andapproval, the acquisition is conducted under the authority of the MultipleAward Schedule Program.s. NetApp is the leading manufacturer of network attached storage (NAS) andstorage area networks (SAN) appliances and is already operational/in-use inthe EUR Bureau. Our in-house engineers have already been trained andhave experience on the NetApp products and our mission critical data isalready in the NetApp format. New units need to be NetApp appliances inorder to complete our storage and disaster recoveryrequirements/operations.6. Using the procedures except as required by 8.405-2(d), the ordering activityhas concluded that the order represents the best value and results in thelowest overall cost alternative (considering price, special features,administrative costs, etc.) to meet the Government's needs. Although GSAhas already negotiated fair and reasonable pricing, ordering activities mayseek additional discounts before placing and order. The price under theGSA Schedule remains constant and unchanged. Therefore, the ratesoffered, under this acquisition is considered fair and reasonable.<BR><BR>7. Market Research was conducted to identify potential vendors of the NetAppproducts on GSA Advantage. FCN Technology Solutions offers theseproducts and has authority to provide GSA schedule quotes on these items.FCN Technology Solutions has provided a preliminary quote and willparticipate in the FEDBID reverse auction.8. Utilizing any other brand than NetApp is simply not feasible in this situation.The office is simply replacing older units with newer units and ones that mayhave more capacity. The data stored on the current devices must be moved tothese devices and will only work on this product line. Furthermore, theengineers are trained on this product line. Additionally, NetApp is the onlyproduct line that is compatible with the office's current storage and DisasterRecovery plans.9. There arc no plans at this point to transition to a different system.<BR><BR>Reposted to update line item 1.<BR><BR>

<DESC>In late 2008, the Coalition purchased approx 60,000 ICOM series Land Mobile Radios (LMR) but due to budget constraints eliminated the associated maintenance and sustainment program and created a gap between operating and maintaining the investment.  ICOM LMR are presently for local command and control communications by the various police and administrative departments of the Iraq Ministry of Interior (MoI) which provides police services throughout Iraq.  While operating with these radios, MoI desires to be as self-sufficient as possible, so toward that end, this SOW is intended to address the need for designated MoI personnel to be able to operate, maintain and sustain the ICOM LMR at the operational and intermediate maintenance levels.  The gap created by purchasing these systems and not purchasing organic maintenance capabilities adds additional burden upon the MoI Directorate of Communication by increasing their reliance upon the Coalition and ICOM systems manufacturer to sustain their operations. 

The objectives of this SOW are to enable the Iraq MoI to be able to conduct its own recurring training program within its own organization(s) so that designated and appropriately certified MoI personnel can train their police operators to effectively operate and maintain the ICOM series LMR, as well as understand operational capabilities well enough to improve its own operations procedures and policies for future growth in command and control capabilities of its police forces

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information contained in this notice.  This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.5.

The National Library of Medicine (NLM) intends to contract, on a sole source basis, with Siemens Building Technologies Inc., 1000 Deerfield Parkway, Buffalo Grove, Illinois.  The purpose of this effort is to provide services for maintenance and calibration of the environmental monitoring system which is currently installed.

Pursuant to section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 as set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 13.501(a)(1)(ii), Siemens is the only known source that is capable of fulfilling this requirement.  The Facilities Manager at NLM has identified Siemens as having the requisite experience, knowledge and skills to perform this work as the monitoring and temperature control equipment is built on a Siemens platform system.  

This is not a request for competition.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  Vendors must demonstrate satisfactory work for clients of comparable size and collection complexity to NLM.  

 The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NLM to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 3:00 PM EDT September 25, 2009.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  Questions regarding NLM-09-223-KDP must be submitted in writing to Kimberly D. Pringle at pringlek@mail.nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have valid certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).

The contractor shall comply with all applicable Federal, State and local laws, executive orders, rules and regulations applicable to its performance under this order.  Full text of clauses and provisions are available at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR):  http://www.arnet.gov/far/.

<DESC>This requirement is to provide follow-on Annual Maintenance Control Software Scrutinizer, Danika and Logalot and Whatsup Gold for Joint Task Force-Global Network Operations (JTF-GNO), Arlington, VA.  This will be solicited as a Limited Source procurement (Name Brand). The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541519.   The period of performance will be 25 Septebmer 2009  24 September 2010.  Companies who can provide the above listed Renewal Maintenance for the product software listed in the attached solicitation HC1028-09-T-2298 must complete the solicitation, available at http://www.fbo.gov/ and return via email to tina.book@disa.mil, no later than 9:00 am Central Time 22 September 2009.   The resultant contract will be a firm fixed price purchase order.  Offerors must have permission to service the intellectual property rights of product software as listed in the solicitation.    Estimated cost is $13,000.00.  

Justification: JTF-GNO considered other network monitoring Platforms, but were eliminated because of over-complexity, lack of functionality, or cost.  JTF-GNO regularly evaluates industry leading vendors to ensure their best interest is being served by the hardware and software solutions they implement.   JTF-GNO Engineers and Administrators found Plixer International, Inc. and IPswitch products meet their needs, are compatible with the existing infrastructure components, and easy to use.  To continue using these products and purchase the annual software assurance far out weigh replacing the network monitoring tools with another manufacturers software with the same or similar functions.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-36. The solicitation number is Q9504090016, and the solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  This Request for Quotation has been made available through www.fbo.gov to comply with the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(e)) and the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 416), that requires contracting officers to disseminate information on proposed contract actions expected to exceed $10,000 or more, by displaying in a public place, or by any appropriate electronic means. Due to the limited amount of public places for positing at Olympic National Park, and the remote locations and accessibility of field sites, electronic posting of Fedbizoppos is utilized to comply with public posting and to promote competition to the extent practical.  This solicitation is a small business set-aside.  The NAICS code is 512110 with an associated small business size standard of $29.5 million (average gross revenue over past three years).  It is the contractor's responsibility to be familiar with applicable clauses and provisions.  Clauses and provisions can be found at http://www.arnet.gov/far.   This solicitation will result in award of a firm, fixed-price contract.  The National Park Service, Olympic National Park, has a requirement for production of nine short movies featuring eight National Park Service sites located in the Pacific Northwest states of Washington and Oregon.
OBJECTIVE:  The goal of this project is to introduce and educate new audiences (youth, students, teachers, web-users) through on-line movie presentations about current research and science activities, highlighting the diversity of natural and cultural resources in National Parks, and highlighting day-to-day operations of scientific field work.  Creative visualization will be a collaborative effort with the contractor and the North Coast and Cascades Research Learning Network (RLN) staff, and will include natural-setting scenic shots, wildlife or other natural resources, on-camera staff interviews, and images of research activities in progress.  It is the Government's intention that the contractor film candidates with engaging on-camera personality, who interact well with park field crews, who can be on-location to capture images or reshoot scenes as needed, and deliver finished products on a deadline.  Each movie will follow a field crew conducting monitoring or studies (in biology, history, archeology, physical sciences, etc.) for a day at each of the following eight parks:  (1) Olympic National Park, headquarters at 600 East Park Avenue, Port Angeles, WA 98362;  (2)  North Cascades National Park, headquarters at 810 State Route 20, Sedro Woolley, WA 98284; (3) Mount Rainier National Park, headquarters at 55210 238th Avenue East, Ashford, WA 98304; (4) Ebeys Landing National Historical Reserve, headquarters at 162 Cemetary Road, Coupeville, WA 98239; (5) San Juan Islands National Historical Park, headquarters at 4668 Cattle Point Road, Friday Harbor, WA 98250;  (6) Fort Vancouver National Historic Site, headquarters at 612 East Reserve Street, Vancouver, WA 98661; (7) Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park - Seattle Unit, headquarters at 319 Second Avenue South, Seattle, WA 98104; and (8) Lewis and Clark National Historical Park, headquarters at 92343 Fort Clatsop Road, Astoria, OR 97103. 
TASK:  Produce a total of 9 each, three to five minute movies:  (A) one introductory movie about the RLN featuring all eight parks referenced above, and (B) one movie for each of the eight parks.  SCOPE OF WORK:  Contractor shall be responsible for obtaining any necessary filming permits from parks, and should coordinate with RLN staff because not all filming will require a permit.  RLN staff will provide appropriate movie content, including the NPS mission statement, and other detailed park information, with the intent that the movies convey factual park information, the importance of why studying a particular resource is vital to achieving NPS goals, and show that science and research are performed in National Parks.  The RLN will coordinate for the contractor, all on-site interviews with park staff, and will be present for most of the filming.  The Government anticipates filming can be achieved in a day at each of the eight parks, and overnight stays in the field with NPS researchers or scientists will not be required.  However, arrangements can be made for the contractor to stay in the field overnight by agreement of the RLN and NPS staff.  Field work may require contractor's crew to cross difficult terrain and film in varying weather conditions.  Upon contractor's submittal of "first draft" of the nine movies, allow six weeks for the RLN staff to review and comment.  Final submittal shall include three master DVDs, raw footage, and edited video files.  HD Video and Final Cut Pro format is preferred.   COMPLETION DATE:  The Government intends that filming be spread out during spring and summer 2010, rather than completed all at once.  The contract performance period will be twelve months from date of award.  The contractor must complete all work within the twelve-month performance period, providing final approved movies to Olympic National Park no later than the end date stated in the contract.  DELIVERY:  Final movies shall be submitted to the attention of Jerry Freilich at Olympic National Park, 600 East Park Avenue, Port Angeles, Washington  98362.  Full details of NPS computer formats will be provided after award.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS - Effective September 18, 2009:
1) MUST FILMING OCCUR OVER THE COURSE OF THE SUMMER MONTHS SO THAT MULTIPLE TRIPS ARE REQUIRED?   No.  NPS will work with the videographer to schedule as much filming as possible into the tightest time frame.  This is a change from the original statement of work.  Due to weather variables and the spatial separation of the northwestern national parks, the Government anticipated that it would be unlikely that all of the work could be accomplished in a single period of eight days, however, the vendor should include its own proposed filming schedule to accomplish all work.
2) ARE THERE SCRIPTS FOR THE PROPOSED SEGMENTS FOR THIS PROJECT?  No.  OR IS THE VENDOR GOING TO PROVIDE THESE SCRIPTS?  The videos will each highlight the activities of a field researcher who will be shown conducting his or her own work.  Although no script is involved, each video sequence will be scheduled and accompanied by an NPS liaison staffer.  The liaison staff will provide a few leading questions to start the interview and the rest will follow ad lib. 3) IF THE VENDOR IS TO PROVIDE SCRIPTS/CONTENT FOR THIS PROJECT CAN YOU GIVE US SOME ADDITIONAL DETAILS AS TO THE TYPES OF RESEARCH AND SUBJECT MATTER THAT WILL BE COVERED AT EACH OF THE SITES?  Vendor does not need to provide or follow a script. Research is all Park Service science projects in many disciplines: vegetation, wildlife, fisheries, coastal, physical science, climate, etc.  See #2. 4) ALSO IS IT POSSIBLE TO GET DETAILS FOR SEASONAL RESTRICTIONS OR REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PRINCIPLE PHOTOGRAPHY AT EACH LOCATION?  There are no restrictions except those of weather and the time when field crews are doing their work, most of which is in the spring and summer. 5) HOW MANY SEPARATE RESEARCHERS WILL BE INVOLVED IN EACH SITE? WILL THERE BE ONLY ONE OR MULTIPLES FOR EACH SITE AND ITS RESEARCH?  Normally a single researcher is in the field with a small crew of 3-4 individuals.  6) IS THERE ANY NEED FOR A IN FILED TALENT TO BE INVOLVED OR SHOULD WE EXPECT THAT THE INTERVIEWS WILL BE TO AN OFF CAMERA SOURCE?  There is no more "Talent" involved than NPS staff. Some researchers are obviously more out-going or photogenic than others. NPS will try to select film subjects passionate about their work. Videographer's task is to convey that passion to audiences. 7) DO YOU EXPECT THAT THERE WILL BE THE NEED FOR EXTENSIVE GRAPHICS TO SUPPORT THE INFORMATION BEING DISCUSSED?  No, there will be no props or visuals except the equipment used by researchers and nature itself. 8) IS THERE A BUDGETARY CAP THAT YOUR ORGANIZATION MUST MAINTAIN ON THIS PROJECT?  While the government estimate cannot be divulged, the Government anticipates this project to be less than $25,000.  The National Park Service expected there to be interest from film students and beginning professionals, willing to tackle a lower-budget project. 9) WHO WILL BE THE KEY CONTACT FOR THIS SERIES OF PROJECTS?  Dr. Jerry Freilich, Coordinator of the North Coast & Cascades Science Learning Network 360-565-3082, jerry_freilich@nps.gov. 10) WHO WILL BE THE FINAL DECISION MAKER(S) FOR THIS SERIES OF PROJECTS.  See #9. 11) IS THERE A DESIRE TO DELIVER THE SERIES IN ONE "GRAND" FINAL DVD OR WOULD IT SERVE THE ORGANIZATION BETTER TO DELIVER THE SERIES AS IT IS COMPLETED, WITH A FINAL COMBINED DVD MASTER WHEN ALL SEGMENTS ARE COMPLETED?  Use of a single grand master is not required.  Each individual video may be provided on its own DVD.  
12) "IT IS THE GOVERNMENT'S INTENTION THAT THE CONTRACTOR FILM CANDIDATES WITH ENGAGING ON-CAMERA PERSONALITY, WHO INTERACT WELL WITH PARK FIELD CREWS, WHO CAN BE ON-LOCATION TO CAPTURE IMAGES OR RESHOOT SCENES AS NEEDED, AND DELIVER FINISHED PRODUCTS ON A DEADLINE."   WHO DOES 'CANDIDATES' REFER TO?  PAID ON-CAMERA TALENT THAT WE AS CONTRACTORS WOULD PROVIDE?  OR MEMBERS OF THE NORTH COAST AND CASCADES RESEARCH LEARNING NETWORK (RLN) AND/OR THE PARK SERVICE RESEARCHERS AND STAFF?  The "Talent" involved is NPS staff.  All film subjects will be NPS staff. Some researchers are obviously more out-going or photogenic than others. NPS will try to select film subjects passionate about their work. Videographer's task is to convey that passion to audiences.
13) "CONTRACTOR SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR OBTAINING ANY NECESSARY FILMING PERMITS FROM PARKS, AND SHOULD COORDINATE WITH RLN STAFF BECAUSE NOT ALL FILMING WILL REQUIRE A PERMIT."  WILL THERE BE A FEE FOR THESE PERMITS?  AND IF SO HOW MUCH?  It is our understanding that permits will not be required because this work is solely for the non-profit use of the National Park Service and the work is being done at our direction. 
14) "FIELD WORK MAY REQUIRE CONTRACTOR'S CREW TO CROSS DIFFICULT TERRAIN AND FILM IN VARYING WEATHER CONDITIONS." WILL 4-WHEEL DRIVE VEHICLES BE REQUIRED? IF SO SHOULD CONTRACTOR PROVIDE THEM?  Nearly all of the field work is conducted in backcountry locations. Equipment will need to be transported via backpack on foot.  Vehicles are not permitted in backcountry areas. Most filming will be conducted at locations within day-trip of front-country roads.  Overnight (backpacking) may be helpful, but not required.  If vendor anticipates spending nights in the back-country, that shall be stated in the quote, mainly as advance notice that arrangements will need to be made, and in some cases, may not be appropriate or authorized, as determined by the RLN or NPS staff.
15) EIGHT SHOOTING DAYS ARE MENTIONED FOR DOCUMENTING THE RESEARCHERS.  SHOULD WE BUDGET FOR ADDITIONAL DAYS TO CAPTURE WILDLIFE AND SCENIC SHOTS, OR WILL THAT BE OBTAINED FROM EXISTING FOOTAGE?  Eight days of field work should suffice for obtaining needed interviews.  Additional footage is highly desireable and can be obtained on field days before and after the interview times. Additional days should not be needed to obtain wildlife shots. A very limited amount of existing video is on hand that may be usable to videographers doing this assignment.
16) IS THERE A BUDGET RANGE FOR THIS PROJECT?  See #8.
17) WILL THE VIDEOS NEED TO BE CAPTIONED OR HAVE AND ASSISTED OR AUDIO DESCRIPTION?  The National Park Service follows government-wide practice in ensuring that videos and similar media are accessible to all audiences.  Close-captioning will be performed by NPS after delivery of the videos.  Film makers do not need to be concerned with providing close-captioning in their delivered products.
18) "QUOTER'S NARRATIVE ABOUT PAST EXPERIENCE IS LIMITED TO TWO PAGES OF TEXT NO SMALLER THAN TWELVE POINT FONT."  DOES THIS MEAN THAT THE OVERALL TECHNICAL PROPOSAL CAN BE LONGER THAN THIS?  Yes.  See #18.
19) "RESUMES OF KEY PERSONNEL MAY BE SUBMITTED, BUT ARE ALSO LIMITED TO TWO PAGES OF TEXT NO SMALLER THAN TWELVE POINT FONT."  DOES THIS MEAN 2 PAGES OF TEXT FOR EACH KEY PERSONNEL?  Yes.  Each resume or summary of vendor's key personnel shall be limited to 2 pages of text, no smaller than 12 point font.  Vendor should not submit a resume for every person it will assign to the project - but rather the person(s) who will be in a leading role, making decisions on behalf of the vendor.  Some vendors may choose to submit an overall summary about key personnel or the firm's past experience, in lieu of resumes, which is fine, but that too is limited to 2 pages of text, no less than 12 point font.  This is not the same as past performance.

The information technology should also use the Windows Installer Service for installation to the default program files directory and should be able to silently install and uninstall.(c) Applications designed for normal end users shall run in the standard user context without elevated system administration privileges.(d) The Department of State currently intends to use Vista in Protected Mode in the future when all devices at all worldwide locations have sufficient capacity to permit an upgrade from the XP operating system.<BR><BR>The Contractor and its employees shall exercise the utmost discretion in regard to all matters relating to their duties and functions.

All documents and records (including photographs) generated during the performance of work under this contract shall be for the sole use and become the exclusive property of the U.S Government. Furthermore, no article, book, pamphlet, email, recording, broadcast, speech television appearance, film or photograph concerning any aspect of work performed under this contract shall be published or disseminated through any media without the prior written authorization of the Contracting Officer.

Further, the sole awardee and only the sole awardee shall submit its invoice to the government and receive payment from the government.<BR><BR>GSA schedule orders may include "open market" items, i.e., items not on the awardee's list of GSA schedule items, only in compliance with FAR 8.402(f). Offerors should verify in writing which items are listed on their GSA schedule contracts and which items are "open market" items. For an offer to qualify as an offer based on a GSA schedule contract, the value of "open market" items included in the offer may not exceed the applicable micro-purchase threshold as defined in FAR 2.101.In order to notate which items are open market, in accordance with FAR 8.402(f)(3), Seller must write "open market" in the Line Item Description for any item not currently active on the cited contract, or list in the Seller Bid Description field all open market line numbers (e.g. "Open Market Items: Lines 1, 2, 3.")<BR><BR>CA/CST/ES owns and has in use several IBMservers.  These IBM servers are used to support projects throughout the Washington Metropolitan Area. The warranties already have or are about to expire; however, they are still in use and are an essential part to CA/CST/ES.  By extending the warranty and reinstating the equipment, CA can ensure that IBM will provide hardware and software troubleshooting after business hours or over the weekend, followed by on-site service and parts when necessary. The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the services identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system.
Due to CAs investment and overall satisfaction with IBM servers and the service IBM provides, it would be counter-productive and unnecessarily costly to attempt to identify, acquire, and install new hardware and new services at this time, assuming that an alternative could be found that offers identical functionality and ease of use.  CA/CST believes that it is critical to the ongoing operation of Consular Systems to continue service for the IBM servers.  Because this service has already been successfully used, CA/CST believes that it is in the Governments best overall interests to procure and use this particular product.The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.<BR><BR>

The Department of State, Office of Acquisition (NLMJAQMJIP/GPB),intends to award a GSA Task Order Contract to a GSA vendor provider ofNetApp Storage Appliances and Support on behalf of European andEurasian Affairs Bureau (EURlIOJEX). Thc estimated cost is $197,942.91.2. The Department of State, Office of Acquisitions is conducting this acquisitionfor the European and Eurasian Affairs Bureau (EURlIOJEX). Under thisprocurement, NetApp Storage Appliance and Support will be solicited onFEDHID, limited to name brand only and GSA Schedule holders.3.

IAW FAR 8.405-6, citing 40 U.S.C. 50 I , Limited sources justification andapproval, the acquisition is conducted under the authority of the MultipleAward Schedule Program.s. NetApp is the leading manufacturer of network attached storage (NAS) andstorage area networks (SAN) appliances and is already operational/in-use inthe EUR Bureau. Our in-house engineers have already been trained andhave experience on the NetApp products and our mission critical data isalready in the NetApp format. New units need to be NetApp appliances inorder to complete our storage and disaster recoveryrequirements/operations.6. Using the procedures except as required by 8.405-2(d), the ordering activityhas concluded that the order represents the best value and results in thelowest overall cost alternative (considering price, special features,administrative costs, etc.) to meet the Government's needs. Although GSAhas already negotiated fair and reasonable pricing, ordering activities mayseek additional discounts before placing and order. The price under theGSA Schedule remains constant and unchanged. Therefore, the ratesoffered, under this acquisition is considered fair and reasonable.<BR><BR>7. Market Research was conducted to identify potential vendors of the NetAppproducts on GSA Advantage. FCN Technology Solutions offers theseproducts and has authority to provide GSA schedule quotes on these items.FCN Technology Solutions has provided a preliminary quote and willparticipate in the FEDBID reverse auction.8. Utilizing any other brand than NetApp is simply not feasible in this situation.The office is simply replacing older units with newer units and ones that mayhave more capacity. The data stored on the current devices must be moved tothese devices and will only work on this product line. Furthermore, theengineers are trained on this product line. Additionally, NetApp is the onlyproduct line that is compatible with the office's current storage and DisasterRecovery plans.9. There arc no plans at this point to transition to a different system.<BR><BR>

<DESC>RECOVERY -- THIS AWARD NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  This project is to complete the design and construction of the proposed second story expansion and alteration to the existing Intermediate Wall Control House at Lock 27 in Granite City, IL. The existing first floor height and window arrangement restricts and hinders the lock operators, and the security cameras visibility into the lock chamber. This creates an unsafe emergency response environment and does not allow for timely emergency response for incidents involving persons within the lock during lock operations, especially tow deckhands.  Lock-operators 24 hour continuous shifts do not allow ready access to toilet facilities at the exiting I-wall control house.<BR><BR>In accordance with section 803 evaluation requirements, the evaluation consensus board (using the evaluation criteria identified in the RFP), determined John J Kirlin Special Projects as the best value contractor to perform the services.  <BR>
