<p><br />The statuatory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this acquisition is 811219, Other Electronic and Precision Equipment Repair and Maintenance.

<p><br />The purpose of this procurement is for Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Inc., to provide maintenance services. Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Inc. is the sole manfacturer of the Shimadzu scientific instrumentation that CDC uses to help accomplish its public health mission. Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Inc., is the only qualified vendor that is capable of providing services for these instruments since they have the servicing and maintenance expertise and are the only company that can supply compatible parts for these instruments. Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Inc. has the technical and software updates as well as factory certified replacement components needed to maintain the instrumentation. Substitution of any other vendor for our requirement would be detrimental to the laboratory's equipment and may result in increased downtime and delays in reporting timelines to maintain the peak performance of the equipment.

No other company can meet the Government's requirement. The equipment list for this maintenance contract is an attachment to this synopsis.</p>

<p><br />52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items OCT 2014</p>
<p><br />ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS<br /><br />The Government will award a firm-fixed priced contract to the responsible offeror whose quote will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <br />(1) Technical Acceptability - The quote demonstrates an understanding of the requirements and the approach meets all performance or capability standards. The offeror has a current facility clearance and is able to provide "green-badge" workers during the specified period of performance.</p>
<p>(2) Price - Price and cost analysis techniques will be used to evaluate an offeror's proposed price. Price will be evaluated for the value offered for the price, and the extent to which it is fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>(3) Past Performance - Evaluation of past performance will be subjective based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances. The currency, content, general trends, and relevance of the information will be considered.</p>
<p>Except communications conducted for the purpose of minor clarifications, the Government intends to evaluate quotes and award a contract without discussions. Therefore, each initial quote should contain the offeror's best terms from a pricing and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if it is later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.</p>
