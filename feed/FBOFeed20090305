<p>CFDA Number: 12.800</p>
<p><br />I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory is soliciting white papers for various scientific studies, analytical tools, algorithm developments, projects, and experiments focused on developing enhanced information fusion technology capabilities to provide the Air Force the means to better conduct Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR).</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>One of the Air Force's key mission is to provide exacting Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) in Ground, Air, Space and Cyberspace. The significance of ISR is growing as our adversaries become more difficult to locate and identify and their intentions more difficult to analyze and predict. The transition from force-on-force confrontation of the past to today's asymmetrical warfare is challenging ISR force to anticipate, find, fix, track, and identify potential targets over broader areas, in less time and with more accuracy than at any other time in history. The goal of ISR operations is to provide accurate, relevant, and timely intelligence information to decision-makers at all levels.</p>
<p>ISR systems and methods must be flexible enough to accommodate diversity in the way we fight, who we fight, and the technology we employ. Specifically, Air Force ISR systems must be able to provide national and military decision-makers intelligence and information of higher fidelity, over a broader scope of operations, meeting a faster operations cycle and in an environment less tolerant of errors than in the past.</p>
<p>One of the desired effects of ISR is dominant Situational Awareness (SA) that allows commanders and their forces to make better-informed decisions and implement them faster than their adversaries can react. Dominant SA is the result of rapid, expert analysis and fusing of multiple sources of information gathered through surveillance and reconnaissance and its synthesis with existing contextual knowledge to produce assessments and predictions needed for superior planning, execution and evaluation of national security actions and joint force operations.</p>
<p>Significant increases in multi-sensor capabilities such as layered sensing will demand much more robust processing capabilities to refine and convert collected data into information products. Sophisticated analytical tools will be required to aid the analyst in fusing and integrating the vast amounts of data from these more capable and numerous ISR sources. Semi-automated and automated tools will be required to assist the analyst in finding the "golden nugget" in the vast array of information. <br /><br />The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate (AFRL/RI) has an established test-bed facility to develop, integrate, test, evaluate, and demonstrate fusion and information technologies to support Command and Control. The Information Fusion (IF) Test-bed facility is used to support algorithm development and evaluation, analytical studies, on-site and network distributed simulation exercises and demonstration of fusion technologies with real and simulated multiple source INTelligence (multi-INT) data. Capabilities include scenario generation, platform and sensor modeling (including JSTARS, LSRS, U2, and Global Hawk). Simulators have been developed for various intelligence data types such as Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) information, ELectronic Signals INTelligence (ELINT) and Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT). Highly developed multi-INT data fusion systems are available for application to the problem of ground target tracking and identification against a variety of operational scenarios. Analytical tools that quantify established Measures of Performance (MOPs) are available for target tracking and other applications. In total the Information Fusion test-bed helps to facilitate a broad range of Command, Control, Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (C2ISR), and fusion technology developments.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE:</p>
<p>The overall objective of this BAA is to develop and demonstrate innovative and advanced information fusion technologies for dominant situational awareness and assessment. This effort will investigate the research and development, evaluation, and demonstration/application of emerging information fusion technologies, products or standards to; (1) automate the fusion of collected, or stored information in support of ISR applicable to the ground, air, space and cyberspace domains; (2) enhance the ability to fuse or correlate data from multi-platform, multi-intelligence sources; and (3) provide for situational awareness, threat assessment, and resource management derived from multiple intelligence sources and within a common operational picture.</p>
<p><br />For the purpose of the BAA, AFRL will focus on technologies to extend and enhance the capabilities of Information Directorate's Information Fusion Test-bed facility. Specific technologies should deliver advanced capabilities that include, but are not limited to advanced data fusion technologies, fusion analytical tools, fusion algorithm developments, fusion metrics and evaluation standards, fusion performance modeling, scenarios for fusion technology testing and the integration of fusion evaluation techniques into an information fusion design for legacy and future ISR systems.</p>

These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after white paper/proposal submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a Top Secret facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to Top Secret information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility such as the AFRL Rome Research Site's Fusion Testbed located in the Corporate Collateral Facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.</p>
<p>3. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS. Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.</p>

<DESC><p>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER THE CONTRACTS IDENTIFIED IN THE ATTACHED LIST.
<p>In June 2008, the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) of the U.S. Department of Education awarded contracts to 49 State Education Agencies (SEAs) (all states except NY, LA, and TX plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico). The period of performance was for a base year of 12 months and 4 12-month option periods for the purpose of providing support to ED by National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) State Coordinators. <br /><br />The Department of Education intends to issue a 12-month task order against each of the existing 49 state contracts to assist SEAs in continued long-term improvement of data collection and submission systems and processes. Final regulations published on January 25, 2007 under 72 FR 3698 require SEAs to use the EDFacts system for submission of all data collected by EDFacts beginning with data collected for SY 2008-09.</p>
<p>These task orders aim to facilitate seamless reporting of complete and timely data to ED and the public. This would be accomplished through steps taken to improve data usage and reporting capabilities within the SEA, including but not limited to: expanding guidance available to Local Education Agencies (LEAs) to improve the quality of their data submissions, automating standard EDFacts reporting formats and enhancing linkages between EDFacts reporting tools and the state's longitudinal student data system.</p>

<DESC><p>The Department of Education intends to issue two new contracts to the State Education Agencies (SEAs) for New York and Louisiana to support long term improvement of data collection through EDFacts. Final regulations published on January 25, 2007 under 72 FR 3698 require SEAs to use the EDFacts system for submission of all data collected by EDFacts beginning with data collected for SY 2008-09.
<p>The SEAs possess unique capabilities in the collection of data from the districts and reporting of that data to the U.S. Department of Education as required for EDFacts. This reporting is a responsibility of the SEA. No other source would be able to access the SEAs' EDFacts reporting systems or the data therein, nor have any binding authority over an SEA's internal data coordination processes. Participation in the Partnership System for the data coordination activities will involve a relationship between the SEA EDFacts Coordinator and OPEPD. The EDFacts Coordinator will be responsible for all data coordination activities and data coordination matters concerning the Partnership System.<br /><br />These contracts aim to facilitate seamless reporting of complete and timely data to ED and the public. This would be accomplished through steps taken to improve data usage and reporting capabilities within the SEA, including but not limited to: expanding guidance available to Local Education Agencies (LEAs) to improve the quality of their data submissions, automating standard EDFacts reporting formats and enhancing linkages between EDFacts reporting tools and the state's longitudinal student data system.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Yield Engineering Systems, Inc., of Livermore, California for the purchase of an HMDS Vacuum Bake / Vapor Prime Oven under other than full and open competition by the authority of FAR subpart 13.106 b(1): Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 

The NIST Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology requires a Hexamethyldisilizane (HMDS) Vacuum Bake / Vapor Prime Oven.  An industry nanofabrication standard utilizes such a system to promote chemical adhesion of a photoresist to a substrate.  A necessary process requirement in nanofabrication uses a photosensitive liquid material called photoresist which is applied to a substrate.  The photoresist is used to create an image and it is very important for this resist to remain adhered to the substrate during processing.  The chemical hexamethyldisilizane (HMDS) in a vapor form is the best way to create this adhesion. 

The required instrument can perform batch processing of multiple cassettes for 75 mm and 100 mm wafers, and is capable of handling several size wafer cassettes up to 200 mm.  It can also provide dual function of delivering anhydrous ammonia to chamber for image reversal processing.  The required instrument has two vessels with pressure gauges to fill with HDMS and ammonia.  

Yield Engineering Systems, Inc. is the only contractor who can provide a HMDS Vacuum Bake / Vapor Prime Oven that meets NISTs requirements.  Therefore, Yield Engineering Systems, Inc. is uniquely qualified to provide the required HMDS Vacuum Bake / Vapor Prime Oven.

Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractors commercial schedule.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  The Government will consider responses received by 3:00 p.m. (EST) on March 20, 2009.  Inquiries will only be accepted via email to paula.wilkison@nist.gov.  No telephone requests will be honored.   

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command intends to award a Sole Source Delivery Order under Basic Ordering Agreement N00019-07-G-0001 to Rolls-Royce PLC, UK, for the work efforts required to design, develop, integrate, and test a form-fit-enhanced-functionality obsolescence upgrade for the AV-8B Engine Monitoring System (EMS) and an improvement to the engine vibration data processing with the development and introduction of dual accelerometer engine tranducers.

The AV-8B EMS is obsolete to the extent that components required for repair are either no longer available or increasingly difficult to obtain. Since the service life of the AV-8B Weapon System has been extended to 2021, an obsolescence upgrade to the EMS and improvements to engine vibration data collection are necessary to safely maintain the AV-8B engine and its related subsystems.

The purpose of this order is to design, develop, integrate and test a form-fit-enhanced-functionality obsolescence upgrade for the AV-8B EMS and dual accelerometer engine transducers usingtechnologically current and available components while minimizing cost and accelerating schedule. In addition, this contract will identify and provide for life cycle logistics such as support equipment, training, and technical publications.

The upgraded EMS shall be based on US132 baseline functionality and at a minimum, perform the same functions as the legacy EMS and shall incorporate additional Input/Output (I/O) capabilities, increase processor performance and memory, and shall address limitations and life cycle support issues of the existing EMS and engine vibration data collection system through 2012.

The results of the development may have applicability to the Governments of Spain, Italy, and the UK; therefore all four nations' specific requirements shall be taken into consideration.

The resulting contracts will be awarded for a base period of one year with four one-year option periods.  FAR Clause 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services will be incorporated into the resulting contracts.  The minimum guarantee for each contract is $5,000.  The aggregate value of task orders issued under the resulting contracts shall not exceed $100,000,000.  The Government intends to award without discussions; therefore, offerors should submit proposals that contain their best terms.
The services to be acquired will be to perform environmental remedial actions; removal actions; remedial design; expedited and emergency response actions; pilot and treatability studies; remedial action systems operation and maintenance; and other related activities associated with returning sites to safe and acceptable levels of contamination. The contaminants will include, but are not limited to, those identified and regulated under RCRA, CERCLA, Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), Solid Waste Disposal Act (SWDA), and petroleum oils and lubricants (POL).  It is anticipated that most of the work resulting from this solicitation will be performed in California. 
Formal source selection procedures will be followed as prescribed by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15 and FAR Supplement as applicable.  Contracts will be awarded to the responsible qualified small business firm(s) whose proposals, conforming to the solicitation, offer the "Best Value" to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The Government intends to award one contract with the proposed Task Order 0001 and to award the remaining contracts with the minimum guarantee of $5,000 each.  The Government reserves the right not to award the Proposed Task Order 0001 identified in the solicitation or to award it at a later date after award of the basic contract(s).  The minimum guarantee applies to the five-year term of the contract(s).  The aggregate value of task orders issued under the contract(s) will not exceed $100,000,000.

Factors 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are of equal importance to each other.  Factor 6 - Price (Price of the proposed Task Order 0001) is slightly less important than any one of the other factors.  When the proposal is evaluated as a whole, Factors 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 when combined are significantly more important than Factor 6.  The importance of price will increase if offerors are considered essentially equal in terms of technical capability or if price is so significantly high as to diminish the value of the proposal's technical superiority to the government.  Proposals shall be submitted in accordance with Sections L, and M of the solicitation.

Performance Work Statement (PWS) for Testing of Lighting Products Compliance with Energy
1.0 Background
The mission of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Office of Inspector General (OIG) is to perform independent work that helps ensure the integrity of EPA programs and operations by promoting economy, efficiency, and effectiveness.  In addition, the OIG seeks to detect and prevent fraud, waste, and mismanagement in Agency programs and operations.  
Energy Star is a joint program of the EPA and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) helping to save money and protect the environment through energy efficient products and practices. In 1992, EPA introduced Energy Star as a voluntary labeling program designed to identify and promote energy-efficient products to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Computers and monitors were the first labeled products.  To participate manufacturers self-certify that at a minimum, their products comply with the Energy Star specifications for that product.  Through 1995, EPA expanded the label to additional office equipment products and residential heating and cooling equipment. In 1996, EPA partnered with the DOE for particular product categories. The Energy Star label is now on major appliances, office equipment, lighting, home electronics, and more. EPA has also extended the label to cover new homes, and commercial and industrial buildings.
The EPA OIG plans to select Energy Star qualified lighting products and have them tested to determine if they meet applicable Energy Star product specifications.  This independent testing will help to verify whether EPA's self-certification process provides reasonable assurance that test results provided by partners and others are representative.  
2.0 ScopeThe contractor shall provide any and all necessary personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and services to test lighting products designated as Energy Star to determine whether they meet the Energy Star specifications. All products will be procured by the OIG and remain the property of the OIG; and must be returned to the OIG upon completion of testing.  The contractor shall perform all tests in accordance with Energy Star testing methodologies located at http://www.energystar.gov/.  The contractor must be accredited by the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP).
The contractor must provide assurance that it has the resources to employ test methods specified by the Energy Star's Eligibility Criteria located at http://www.energystar.gov/.  for each product selected for testing.  The contractor must maintain the applicable certifications or specification requirements that are specified by Industry or by the Energy Star testing guidelines located at http://www.energystar.gov/.  The contractor shall provide personnel with background and expertise in areas germane to the objectives.2.1 Contractor Personnel
	2.11 Project Manager.  The contractor shall provide a project manager who shall be responsible for the performance of work and certified to oversee testing.  The name of this person, and an alternate who shall act for the contractor when the manager is absent, shall be designated in writing to the Contracting Officer and their representative. 	2.12 The project manager and alternate shall have full authority to act for the contractor on all contract matters relating to daily operation of this contract.
	2.13 The project manager and alternate shall be available during normal business hours, with reasonable notice, to discuss the project.
2.2 Contractor Employees  
2.21 Before starting work under this contract, contract employees performing testing must have all applicable certification and/or specification requirements that are specified by Industry and/or by the Energy Star testing guidelines.  Proof of these certifications and statements that the personnel do not have a conflict of interest will be submitted to the Contracting Officer and their representative prior to starting work under this contract.
	2.22 Conflict Of Interest.  In order for the OIG to evaluate any potential conflict of interest, please disclose any and all Energy Star product testing performed for private manufacturers, Environmental Protection Agency, or Department of Energy within the last five years.  The selected vendor also cannot be currently employed by any of the above entities to perform work duplicative to that referenced in the PWS.  2.23 The contractor must provide proposed subcontractors and obtain approval prior to subcontracting out any testing required under this contract.  Subcontractors must meet the same requirements and standards as the prime described in the Performance Work Statement.
	2.24 The contractor shall not utilize the services of any person who is an employee of the U.S. Government if employing that person would create a conflict of interest in work performed under this contract.  
3.0 ObjectivesThe objective of this work is to test Energy Star lighting products to determine whether they comply with the Energy Star specifications for those products. Repeat testing may be requested for some products after initial test results are received.  In addition, other Energy Star products may be tested if OIG determines a need to do so.  This information will be used to protect Energy Star brand integrity and strengthen the EPA Energy Star's quality assurance program.
4.0 Tasks	4.1 Procurement of Energy Star Products

<DESC>Communications technology that can provide seamless, robust, connectivity is at the foundation of the Sea Power 21 and FORCEnet Vision "... to have the right information, at the right place, at the right time ..." The performance of Command and Control (C2) systems and decision making at all levels of command depend critically on reliable, interoperable, survivable, secure and timely communications and networking, and the availability of high capacity multimedia (voice, data, imagery) communication networks is fundamental to nearly all Department of Navy missions.

The current evolution of naval warfighting from a platform-centric to a network-centric paradigm depends on successfully meeting the implied need for significantly enhanced communications and networking capabilities, extending both to fixed shore facilities and to highly mobile air, surface, land and subsurface platforms, including the so-called "disadvantaged user", e.g., small-deck combatants, submarines, unmanned air vehicles (UAVs), dispersed ground units in urban and radio frequency (RF) challenged environments. Many of these tactical platforms and users routinely operate in a highly intermittent, often disconnected communications environment.

The goal of the Communications and Networking Program within the Office of Naval Research (ONR 312) is to support the FORCEnet vision by developing measurable advances in technology that can directly enable and enhance end-to-end connectivity and quality-of-service for mission-critical information exchange among such widely dispersed naval, joint and coalition forces. The vision is to provide high throughput robust communications and autonomous networking to ensure all warfighters from the operational command to the tactical edge have access to information, knowledge, and decision-making necessary to perform their assigned tasks.

White papers for potential FY10 Exploratory Development/Applied Research (Budget category 6.2) projects are sought under the following focus areas:

1. Next generation tactical data link waveforms/networks simultaneously satisfying conflicting requirements of low-intercept, anti-jam and bandwidth, while being scalable to hundreds of nodes within a few hops (i.e., maintain low latency).

2. Electronic protection for High Frequency (HF) Communications (e.g., electrically small antennas, low observable or feature-less waveforms, rapid synch/detection, blind beam forming, and dynamic interference cancellation).

3. Efficient and robust multi-hop networking in the presence of significant differences in communications performance between transmit and receive links (e.g., asymmetry in error rate due to link disruption) of some pairs of nodes. 

4. Concepts using the platform superstructure as an antenna and efficiently coupling the signal to the communications system, both in the receive as well as in the transmit direction. Some receive capability has been shown in the HF, but needs to be expanded to other frequency bands.

5. Mitigation techniques to overcome poor optical propagation through aerosols/obscurants (e.g., fog and cloud propagation/scattering of 1.5 micron communications wavelength) ONR is also receptive to highly innovative ideas in other general communications and networking areas that are not designated focus as above, but nonetheless important to Navy/Marine Corps, as determined under the synopsis section above.
Work funded under a BAA may include basic research, applied research and some advanced technology development (ATD). With regard to any restrictions on the conduct or outcome of work funded under this BAA, ONR will follow the guidance on and definition of "contracted fundamental research" as provided in the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics) Memorandum of 26 June 2008. As defined therein, the definition of "contracted fundamental research", in a DoD contractual context, includes [research performed under] grants and contracts that are (a) funded by Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation Budget Activity 1 (Basic Research), whether performed by universities or industry or (b) funded by Budget Activity 2 (Applied Research) and performed on campus at a university or by industry. ATD is funded through Budget Activity 3.  In conformance with the USD (AT&L) guidance and National Security Decision Directive 189, ONR will place no restriction on the conduct or reporting of unclassified fundamental research, except as otherwise required by statute, regulation or Executive Order. Normally, fundamental research is awarded under grants with universities and under contracts with industry. ATD is normally awarded under contracts and may require restrictions during the conduct of the research and DoD pre-publication review of research results due to subject matter sensitivity.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC><p>Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) plans to issue a sole source extension modification for the DISN Transmission Services - CONUS / Access Optimization (DTS-C/AO) Contract HC1013-06-D-2006 with AT&amp;T.  The proposed modification is a continuation and extension of the work performed by AT&amp;T.  DISA intends to extend the existing contract with AT&amp;T to allow for the sustainment of services until approximately 400 circuits can be transitioned off the existing contract.  The modification will extend the period of performance from 27 July 2009 to 26 Jan 2010 with one additional six month option.  The DTS-C/AO contract provides T-1 through OC-N transmission services for the Department of Defense and its Services and Agencies and other Federal Departments within the Continental United States.  In addition to transmission services, the DTS-C/AO Contract provides (as specified by the Government) post, camp, and station wiring to accommodate transmission service delivery to identified Service Delivery Point(s) (SDP).  The contractor must maintain any equipment they installed and provide trouble administration functions to enable users to report problems that effect service, to resolve reported problems, and to determine the status of trouble reports.  The DTS-C/AO contractor ensures the protection of the circuits and the network management data transported or contained within the circuits.  The contractor provides administration, operations and maintenance support sufficient to ensure continued operation of the DTS-C/AO services in accordance with the specific requirements of the contract.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The DTS-C/AO circuits must remain with the existing contractor until they are either transitioned to another contract or discontinued.  AT&amp;T is the only vendor capable of providing continuous, uninterrupted transmission service after 26 July 2009 for the users of the contract.  No other contractors would be able to have all the required circuits in place that can provide service to the required locations prior to the expiration of the DTS-C/AO contract.  All inquiries regarding the sole source modification shall be submitted electronically and directed to Meghan E. Eversgerd, Contract Officer, at meghan.eversgerd@disa.mil.  (NAICS) 517110 is applicable to this acquisition.</p>

<DESC><p><strong>Expressions of Interest Sought</strong>
<p><strong>Requirement:</strong></p>
<p>The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Wichita, Kansas, that will be expiring. The Government is seeking to lease approximately 1,467 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space. The rentable space must yield a minimum of 1,280 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet. The lease term requirement is for 10 years, 5 years firm. The space must be available for occupancy by April 17, 2010. <strong>The delineated area is within the city limits of Wichita, Kansas.</strong></p>
<p>Other requirements applicable to this requirement include:</p>
<p>&bull; 2 structured parking spaces for official Government vehicles.</p>
<p>The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost/benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location.

The MICH-STANDARD helmet will be used throughout the spectrum of Special Operations Forces (SOF) operational continuum, from Humanitarian Assistance and Peacekeeping, through Counter-Terrorism and Counterinsurgency, to low intensity conflict and full-scale war.  The environmental conditions will range from tropic to arctic and from arid desert to open ocean with weather conditions associated with these environments to include limited visibility. <BR>The MICH-ENHANCED is also an improved MICH helmet that provides the SOF Operator current state of the art ballistic and impact protection. provides all the added benefits and protections of a Standard MICH helmet with the added features of configurability for the full spectrum of SOF mission, plus the MICH-ENHANCED will provide protection against rifle threats.<BR>The Government envisions that a Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract will be awarded for each helmet line or a single award if one vendor wins both helmet lines as a result of the Request for Proposals (RFP) but reserves the right to award one or none.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE. NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. BASED ON CAPABILITY STATEMENTS RECEIVED IN RESPONSE TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT THIS ACQUISITION MAY BE SOLICITED AS A 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.  ALL SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS (SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB, and SDVOSB) ARE ENCOURAGED TO RESPOND TO THIS NOTICE.  SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS MUST HAVE THEIR SIZE STATUS CERTIFIED BY THE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION.  ALL SMALL BUSINESSES ARE ENCOURAGED TO RESPOND. THE NAICS CODE IS 541711 WITH A SIZE STANDARD OF 500 employees.

Research supported and conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), strives to better understand, treat, and ultimately prevent immunologic, infectious, and allergic diseases.  The NIAID Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation (DAIT) supports extramural basic, pre-clinical and clinical research focusing on immune-mediated diseases through a variety of research grants and contracts.  This includes support for clinical research to evaluate the safety and efficacy of therapeutic and preventive approaches and agents and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of such approaches and agents.

This requirement for the Statistical and Data Coordinating Center (SDCC) for the Atopic Dermatitis Research Network provides critical services for the design, implementation, oversight (including regulatory support and compliance, safety and clinical site monitoring and reporting, training, and distribution and quality control of study products), and analysis of DAIT, NIAID-supported Atopic Dermatitis Research Network clinical studies and clinical trials and associated mechanistic studies being conducted by this group.

The purpose of the Atopic Dermatitis Research Network (ADRN) is to study the defense mechanisms of the skin, with research focused on atopic dermatitis (AD) and its association with both immune and skin barrier defects (compared to non-atopic individuals). Specific research areas may include the defects resulting in susceptibility to eczema vaccinatum (EV) and eczema herpeticum (EH), and to colonization and infection with Staphylococcus aureus (SA) (including methicillin-resistant Staphylcoccus aureus, MRSA), and responsiveness of AD subjects to vaccines. It is anticipated that research conducted within the ADRN will utilize state of the art techniques to measure immune responses and skin barrier function, and will capitalize on new scientific opportunities and advancements in the field. The ADRN will support multi-disciplinary teams that include qualified personnel committed to the project in areas proposed.  This is likely to include immunologists, virologists, bacteriologists, geneticists, dermatologists and allergists.

This Network was originally established as the Atopic Dermatitis and Vaccinia Network (ADVN), consisting of three contracts: a Clinical Studies Consortium, an Animal Studies Consortium and a Statistical and Data Coordinating Center These three contracts were originally funded from 2004-2009, and the contracts were then extended until 2010. The ADVN has been focused on the pathogenesis of EV, with the ultimate goal of reducing the severity of EV, but the new solicitation extends the scope of the Network to the research areas described above.

The initial ADVN SDCC contract was awarded to Rho Federal Systems, Inc. in 2004 (Contract Number HHSN26620040033C ) and has served to provide a broad range of clinical research support services to the ADVN.  Under this contract, those services will be continued and will also be expanded to provide support for the expanded research areas of the new Atopic Dermatitis Research Network.

Potential sources must demonstrate and document their ability to perform the following in their capability statements:

The Contractor shall establish and manage the ADRN SACCC to provide statistical, clinical, technical, regulatory and administrative support for Atopic Dermatitis Network clinical studies and clinical trials and associated mechanistic studies, including support for the following: (1) statistical design and analysis, including interim and final analyses of study data from clinical studies and clinical trials, as well as any animal studies that are performed; (2) data collection, management, quality assurance and reporting; (3) regulatory activities, including compliance with Federal and country-specific regulatory requirements and current Good Clinical Practice (GCP), Good Laboratory Practice (GLP), and Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) guidelines for research involving human subjects; (4) safety oversight and reporting, including support for the activities of independent Data and Safety Monitoring Boards (DSMBs) and other safety oversight structures; (5) clinical site monitoring and training for clinical site personnel; (6) preparation of study products; (7) distribution and quality control of study products; (8) continuation, expansion and management of a Registry of subjects with AD and subsets of AD subjects, and (9) computer tracking support for a repository for biological specimens. In addition, technical and administrative support shall be provided for the ADRN Steering Committee.

Project Type and description: 

This project is for Construction, at the NIH Bethesda Campu, Maryland.  Building 4 (candidate for registration as a Historic Building) is a 67 year old Building that is located on the NIH Bethesda, MD campus.  It houses research laboratories, and is a four story building with three basement levels.  The top level is used as a mechanical mezzanine. This project consists of renovating the first and second floors of Building 4 in two phases, totaling approximately 29,000 Gross Square Foot (GSF). 

The project includes research labs with office space for scientist, tissue culture rooms, equipment rooms, cold rooms, autoclave rooms, LAN rooms, admin area, conference room, break room, restrooms and lobby.  

The existing building system is a dual duct forced air system with air handling units located in the B3 level. The existing infrastructure capacity is sufficient to support the air requirements to renovate these two floors. The dual duct system will be converted to a single duct system with terminal heating coil units to increase energy performance and temperature control. Additionally, Electrical Switchboard will be added in the basement to support the new work for these floors. Since existing electrical gear must remain active during construction, new equipment (installed in parallel) must be added to support the renovation.

Building 4 is a candidate for registration as a Historic Building and is located on a Historic Site. This is an interior renovation project; the envelope of the building shall remain intact.

Contract Duration: 16 to 24 months
Estimated Eagnitude of Construction: $5M to $20M

Please note:  This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY, NOT A SOLICITATION.  Any proposal or quote for future funding will not be considered.  There is not any funding available to fund any work.  	This announcement is a call for white papers from industry, academia, laboratories, and relevant developers that wish to make known to the DoD their intent to participate and a short description about their system.  Based on the contents of the white papers, submitters may be selected to individually and privately present to a DoD-only audience of program/project managers/engineers and specified support contractors.  The government reserves the right to decline the participation of an applicant if they feel the proposal does not meet the intended scope of the investigation.  Presentations shall not contain classified material. 	The United States Marine Corps and other DoD services intend to gather information about the current and future state of the art for ground based man-portable laser designators. The knowledge gained from this investigation will help the DoD to plan R&D efforts and to generate future specifications that allow for state of the art equipment to be available to the warfighter.  The government is interested in systems that are lighter, smaller, more power efficient, and more capable than the current systems.  The government is also interested in innovative approaches to fulfilling the role of laser target designating, day/night laser spot imaging, and target marking including 3-5 um lasers.	The intent is to provide the respondent the opportunity to give a one hour briefing to an audience of multi-service government only and specified support contractors about their ideas, concepts, and technologies that apply to ground based man-portable laser designators, markers, & laser spot imagers.  If participants have hardware they wish to demonstrate, a second day will be provided where participants can set up on a laser range to allow the government observers to operate the systems.  Participation in the field demonstration portion is not required.  Systems participating in the field demonstration will be subject to a safety assessment.
Questions should be directed to Bonnie Impastato, (Code CXS11-4), Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division, 17632 Dahlgren Road, Suite 157, Dahlgren, VA 22448-5110, or email to bonnie.impastato@navy.mil. 	System Characteristics for the topic area of interest / objectives are as follows:	The USMC currently uses the AN/PEQ-1B Ground Laser Target Designator (GLTDII), AN/PEQ-1A SOFLAM, AN/PEQ-17 Portable Lightweight Designator/Rangefinder (PLDR), and the AN/PAS-25 Thermal Laser Spot Imager (TLSI).  The joint services have an Initial Capabilities Document for the Joint Effects Targeting System that describes the objective characteristics of a Target Location/Designation System (TLDS).  Some of the objective characteristics applicable to this synopsis include:
.	Target Marker:  >4km .	Day/Night Laser Spot Imager:  >8km.	Designator Range:  >8km.	Target Location/Designator System Weight:  <5 lbs for designation module and batteries .	Total TLDS weight:  <15 lbs (including tripod, batteries, and cables)
Designator output energies of at least 50 mJ are acceptable.  A system that uses a novel approach or addresses a specific designator mission and does not meet these same characteristics could still be of interest.Application and Submission Process for White PapersAll white papers submissions will be protected from unauthorized disclosure in accordance with FAR 15.207, applicable law, and Department of Defense and Department of Navy regulations. Offerors are expected to appropriately mark each page of their submission that contains proprietary information.  Submitted white papers shall not contain classified material.

Starting in December 2001 with the promulgation of Program Decision Memorandum IV, the architecture has evolved from largely a segmented collection of separate systems to a fully integrated system supporting the complete spectrum of user needs from diverse communities of interest. The resultant Transformational Communications Architecture (TCA) is viewed as the means of incorporating new technologies to provide significant levels of capabilities needed in the post-2010 timeframe.</p>
<p>As the Program Manager for the Global Information Grid (GIG) and upgrades to the GIG, DISA has committed its support to TCA activities. DISA/GE22, as the lead office for communications transport, is a key source of engineering expertise for these efforts. Request small businesses qualified to support this contract action provide their experience and understanding of the following SATCOM areas:</p>
<p>&#61607; Analysis and assessment of SATCOM user requirements;<br />&#61607; Support to the Capabilities Development Document (CDD) Development, and Capabilities Production Document (CPD) processes;<br />&#61607; Support to the TCA acquisition process;<br />&#61607; SATCOM Integrated Concept Team (ICT) participation;<br />&#61607; SATCOM performance assessment tool development;<br />&#61607; SATCOM Gateway architecture assessments;<br />&#61607; Support for the SATCOM Data Base (SDB) requirements process; and<br />&#61607; Ad hoc support to ongoing and new studies and analysis activities (e.g., the Capability Portfolio Management (CPM) process for ASD(NII))</p>
<p>A key element in the efficient operation/management of user needs from these diverse communities of interest is the Satellite Communications (SATCOM) Database (SDB). The JCDSC originated with the development of the SDB to support the Joint Staff in their evaluation of satellite communications requirements. This capability has evolved into a much more comprehensive decision support system that includes an integrated satellite communications requirements data base, a data base of various war fighting scenarios and their associated communications needs, and a collection of system modeling and costing tools. The range of supported elements likewise expanded to include Combatant Commanders, Service, Agency, Joint Staff, and Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Networks and Information Integration (NII) planners. The set of current and future SATCOM requirements forms the SATCOM Communications Data Base (SDB).</p>
<p>The JCDSC maintains the SDB and develops the software required for Remote Users to access the SDB. The software suite required to access the SDB is known as the SATCOM Database - Management Tool (SDB-MT). To meet the needs of DISA, the Joint Staff, and organizations responsible for follow-on SATCOM systems development, the JCDSC maintains the Scenario Development Tool (SDT) software application.</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION:  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION; no award will be made as a result of this request.  This request for information is for informational purposes only; this is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  All interested parties are encouraged to respond to this RFI. The Government will not pay for information and materials received in response to this RFI and is in no way obligated by the information received.<BR><BR>1. SCOPE.<BR>Background: The mission of the U.S. Army Rapid Equipping Force (REF) is to rapidly increase mission capability while reducing risk to Soldiers and others by equipping operational commanders with off-the-shelf (government or commercial) solutions or near-term developmental items that can be researched, developed and acquired quickly.  The REF receives requirements from operational commanders in war zones setting forth the capabilities needed.  The REF is chartered by the Senior Army leadership to provide material solutions to meet these requirements in a significantly reduced timeline compared to traditional Department of Defense acquisition procedures.<BR><BR>The purpose of this RFI is to obtain potential solutions to provide concepts and products to decrease the lethality of explosives in culverts.   The REF believes that Counter-Insurgency Operations (COIN) in Iraq and Afghanistan will require the use of improved culvert material capable of mitigating blast effects of explosives emplaced in and around culvert areas.   In order to accomplish this effort the REF will look at solutions submitted by companies providing economical and effective strategies. <BR><BR>Experience and information obtained from this request for information will be provided to Army Product Manager REF who will evaluate the information and feasibility of issuing a procurement action to resolve the stated problem.<BR><BR>2. REQUIREMENTS. <BR>The REF is requesting information pertaining to technology or systems that can or has been developed for culvert design/materials focused on dissipation/absorption/redirection of blast energy and/or denying emplacement/access and warning.<BR><BR>2.1.	The vendor must provide prototype blast demonstration and measurement/analysis of results<BR>2.2.	Developed material must render substantial amounts of explosives emplaced in culvert non-lethal to military vehicular traffic<BR>2.3.	Material or device must not limit water flow thru culvert<BR>2.4.	Cost must not exceed $1500.00 per culvert<BR>2.5.	Capable of withstanding temperature range of: -25.6 C to +49  C<BR>2.6.	Capable of withstanding humidity ranges from 0 to 100% humidity<BR>	2.8. 	Identify number of days for your proposed demonstration of systems that meets the above requirements.<BR><BR>3. DELIVERABLES<BR>Specific information on industry capability to produce a system that can meet the requirements identified in paragraph 2 above, or otherwise solve the problem of identifying and detecting objects being emplaced using low cost, low technology systems.<BR><BR>This is NOT a Request for Proposal. Companies who desire to participate in this market survey are encouraged to submit a white paper which supports the companys claim that it presently has the technology, qualifications, and capabilities to satisfy one or more of the performance and technical objectives described above.  The white paper should discuss the companys ability to develop materials/systems focused on redirection of blast energy within culverts in Iraq and Afghanistan and should provide a ROM (rough order of magnitude) price and its anticipated delivery for the solution proposed.<BR><BR>The white paper should also discuss related company experience and include point(s) of contact.  The white paper should be prepared in MS Word, limited to ten (10) pages, and submitted electronically to the contracting officer at peter.buckless@us.army.mil.  The company shall be responsible for any costs associated with preparing responses to this market research.  All requests for further information must be made in writing or via email; telephone requests for additional information will not be honored.  The government will review RFI submissions as they are received.  The government reserves the right to close this RFI once they have received adequate response(s) to this RFI.<BR><BR>Responses to this request are due by April 3, 2009  2:00pm EST to Peter Buckless (peter.buckless@us.army.mil).<BR>

<DESC>General Notice:  The purpose of this notice is to announce that the Government intends to enter into a contractual agreement with Sea Island Software, Inc. to provide hurricane planning services through the operation and maintenance of HURREVAC.  At this time, Sea Island Software, Inc. is the only known vendor that can provide the planning services in this manner.  The Government is interested in determining if any other businesses can provide for the operation and maintenance of HURREVAC as described in this solicitation.<BR><BR>General Information:  The multi-agency National Hurricane Program (NHP) helps protect communities and residents from hurricane hazards through various projects and activities. Established in 1985, the NHP has also prepared numerous Hurricane Evacuation Studies (HES) and provided tools and technical assistance to State and local agencies in developing hurricane evacuation plans.  To support the management of HES data, the NHP commissioned the development of HURREVAC (HURRicane EVACuation) in 1988.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: 
Department of Homeland Security

Certification Requirements:


New Employee/FCIP Training RequirementsAccelerated Training Program
The Geosciences professionals at the MMS are responsible for evaluating fair market value of offshore leases, ensuring conservation and diligence of resource development, estimating the volume of public resources and reserves, and assuring safe operations throughout the Gulf of Mexico.  A training program to bring the many new employees and FCIP personnel up to speed as soon as possible is essential.
With critical time frames outlined by the OCS Oil and Gas Leasing Program 2007-2012, new employees need an accelerated training program to bring them to minimum levels of competency in a shortened time frame.  This training program needs to accommodate 10 to 20 new employees, be intensive, concentrated, and tightly integrated with geology, geophysics and engineering disciplines. This training program should also be commercially available in an off-the-shelf configuration designed for oil and gas prospect and development analysis.  The training should integrate critical hands-on experience to allow the new employee to return from training and immediately contribute to mission goals. The training must take place this summer (2009) as there are already 12 to 15 new employees on board that are mandated to be trained by the FCIP program or are just new hires that need to be incorporated into Unit assignments as soon as possible.  Required areas of competency for an MMS Geoscientist are structural styles; sequence stratigraphy; open-hole log analysis; seismic survey design, acquisition, and processing; 2-D and 3-D seismic subsurface interpretation; subsurface geological mapping; oil and gas prospect identification; field determination and mapping; and field performance and reserves estimation.  Also, overviews of the oil and gas industry in general are important for these new hires as many of them have little or no Gulf of Mexico backgrounds.  Through past history at the MMS this training must also include an intensive mentored mapping project workshop in conjunction with the classes in a controlled environment with measureable results.  Furthermore, the training needs to be at MMS, New Orleans.

DESCRIPTION: 
The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Advanced Measurement Technology, Inc, of Oak Ridge , TN for the purchase of a Gamma Ray Detector under other than full and open competition by the authority of FAR subpart 13.106-(b): Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 

NIST must have an identical replacement of the original detector in order to maintain compatibility. The detector is the proprietary design of Advanced Measurement Technology, Inc (Ortec). The use of any other detector would require a costly redesign of our experiment and make existing measurement data taken over several years, unusable and useless.

 Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractors commercial schedule.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  The Government will consider responses received by 1:00 p.m. (EST) on March 19, 2009.  Inquiries will only be accepted via email to janet.lamb@nist.gov.  No telephone requests will be honored.    

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.

<DESC>Request for Information:
Operator Interface & Management Applications for Command and Control

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

DHS-S&Ts Standoff Technology Integration Demonstration Program (STIDP) is designed to accelerate the development of standoff and remotely operated explosives detection technologies, related technologies, concepts of operations, and training. The ultimate goal of the program is to prevent explosives attacks at large public events and mass transit facilities via a spiral development approach. 


PROBLEM STATEMENT 
The C3center operations and the supporting infrastructure are critical components in the operations of any countermeasure architecture.  System operation and management applications and integration solutions are needed for deployment in a command center for testing countermeasure architecture operations.  Operations include law enforcement personnel using a variety of standoff sensor systems geographically distributed over an outdoor public venue to screen patrons attending events, such as hockey games.  Software, middleware, and other relevant solutions are needed to provide and/or integrate area surveillance cameras for situational awareness; threat and asset evaluation, prioritization and management; and support and record screening and interdiction decisions;  A single operator interface is needed to control a variety of integrated sensors and screening systems; plays back in real time  (on the fly), and requires only limited operator customization.  Desired functionality includes coordinate-based mapping for the relative position of people approaching the venue. The optimum solution would be customizable and executable on both stationary and mobile/tablet devices.  
The nature of the STIDP test bed requires that supporting system applications be based on an open architecture and recognized national standards.  Adopted technology solutions must allow for integration functionality regardless of which sensor system may be deployed.  Complete integration solutions as well as individual system components will be considered.

FUNCTIONAL & OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS
The solution must:
	Provide simultaneous and real-time display of live and recorded data by multiple computers on a network
	Allow viewing of recorded data while real-time data are being recorded
	Provide a graphical user interface that requires minimal training and is easy to use
	Operate with standard input devices (e.g.,  mice, keyboard, stylus)
	Coincides with typical law enforcement operations and equipment
	Provide management and display of pre-defined system alarms 
	Use system processing and data recording processes that are automated and transparent to the operator 
	Provide the ability to easily and dynamically add and remove data sources with minimal changes to the systems configuration 
	Provide the ability to input, view, and track data based on a date-time stamp, and store disparate types of data (i.e., video and text)
	Provide a means to archive and/or back up data generated by the application
	Provide the ability to set custom archiving and processing schedules
	Allow the movement of the archive data from one location to another (both on and off the network) without losing the ability to access and process the data
	Provide operators the functionality of interacting with camera and PTZ units through hardware and software that is easy to learn and use
	Track events based upon time and alert indices per sensor or camera
	Provide the means to search the data sets based upon time or alert indices
	Provide the ability to easily create high-quality exports of data segments both textually and graphically
	Provide the means to analyze and mine recorded sensor data
	Provide the means to perform self diagnostics
	Use a distributed network
	Provide value-added and decision-making tools
	Provide the ability to create custom views of user displays
	Provide multi-sensor and camera views during real-time events and post events.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL<BR>FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<BR><BR>1.	CONTRACTING AGENCY:  Portland District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers<BR><BR>2.	DESCRIPTION OF ACTION:  Approval for a new Firm-Fixed Price Contract using FY09 Columbia River Fish Mitigation Act funding.<BR><BR>3.	DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES OR NATURE OF CONSTRUCTION:  Purchase of high energy density lithium battery packs to power juvenile salmon acoustic telemetry system (JSATS) autonomous receivers during the FY09 Field Season. The underwater receiver detects and decodes a modulated ultrasound signal transmitted from acoustic fish tags and are used for evaluation of fish behavior and survival. The delivery schedule is from 01 May 2009 to 01 July 2009.  <BR><BR>The estimated contract price is: $106,422.00.<BR><BR>4.	AUTHORITY CITED:  10 U.S.C.2304 (c)(1) & FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(B). Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.<BR><BR>5.	REASON FOR AUTHORITY CITED:  In the development, of the JSATS autonomous receiver, batteries from several manufacturers were tested to identify the longest life and most reliable batteries required to power the receivers.  The results of this testing (see attachment 1) revealed that Tadiran batteries met the requirements specified by the USACE.<BR><BR>6.	BACKGROUND:  The Portland District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, owns 185 autonomous acoustic receivers designed and built by Sonic Concepts, Inc.  The battery packs currently being used in the receiver are made up of seven batteries, soldered together in series. The batteries used in the packs are lithium/thionyl chloride batteries made by Tadiran. The Tadiran brand battery was chosen by USACE based on its proven ability to operate the receiver for at least 30 days. <BR><BR>   a) Justification:<BR>	1) The battery packs must utilize Tadiran batteries, be able to provide at least 30 days of power and be light enough so that the receiver remains buoyant. We need a total of 510 packs with shipment beginning in May in order to continue fish monitoring. <BR><BR>	2) The proposed contractor is Saft Federal Systems, Inc a subsidiary of Tadiran Batteries LTD who are the manufacturer of the Tadiran battery.  Saft Federal Systems, Inc. has the battery supplies on-hand for the packs and has the expertise to manufacture a battery pack that meets our design criteria and battery life needs for the receivers. Their design will result in a cost savings to the government of 48% over the battery pack purchased in 2007.  <BR><BR>	3) Competition to design a battery pack may have been feasible if there had been enough time to solicit and evaluate proposed designs. Unfortunately, due to the Continuing Resolution Act (CRA) and regional prioritization actions funds were not made available to the research team until January 2009. The battery packs must be replaced starting in May to continue tracking the fish without interruption and subsequent lose of data. <BR><BR>	4) Saft Federal Systems, Inc a subsidiary of Tadiran Batteries LTD provided these battery packs in 2008 (under a sole source procurement).  For FY09, the District intended to award a contract under full and open competition to procure autonomous nodes, which would include the battery packs, however, the award has been delayed until FY10.<BR><BR>	5) Under the Endangered Species Act for the protection of stocks of Pacific Salmon listed as threatened or endangered, the 2008 National Marine Fisheries Service Biological Opinion on FCRPS (http://www.salmonrecovery.gov/) mandates that the Action Agencies provide improvements for fish passage and survival through physical and operational changes to the hydropower system.  These changes require thorough investigation in to the efficacy of proposed changes.  The JSATS autonomous receiver are a critical and functional part of these investigations.  <BR><BR>b) Impacts<BR><BR>1) Failure to obtain the battery packs will result in the failure of several key research programs funded by the USACE to meet the requirements of the 2008 NMFS Biological Opinion on the FCRPS for the recovery of ESA-listed stocks of Pacific Salmon.  For FY09, the USACE has committed to nearly $2 million to research contracts that require the JSATS autonomous receivers.<BR><BR><BR>	2) Alternatives: The technical team did consider using USACE labor to assemble the battery packs, but that would still require an acceptable battery pack design and manufacturing of the battery pack. The cost of using our own labor would be approximately $60,000 not including the cost of materials and tools.  Additionally, the time to solicit for production of the pack would not meet our deadline to keep the receivers operational for the upcoming juvenile salmon migration season.<BR><BR><BR><BR>7.	EFFORTS TO OBTAIN COMPETITION:  Based on information in paragraph 6 above, competition for this action is not feasible.<BR><BR>8.	ACTIONS TO INCREASE COMPETITION:  In 2009, the Portland District USACE will issue a competitive solicitation to the acoustic telemetry market for a base plus 4 year options contract for the manufacture of new and refurbishment of existing receivers and to add needed features and repair of all receivers purchased and/or refurbished under that contract.  Work completed under this new contract may result in re-evaluation of battery needs and criteria and ultimately a new batter pack design.  The USACE will subsequently pursue a competitive contract for the procurement of battery packs.  This contract will be in place prior to the FY10 salmon research season.  <BR><BR>9.	MARKET RESEARCH:  An abbreviated search was conducted due to the urgency of fulfilling this requirement for battery packs. The original designer of the receivers, Sonic Concepts, Inc., was contacted to solicit a battery pack design that would reduce costs, and they suggested we contact the battery manufacturer for another battery pack provider source. As stated previously, funding was not available to activate the technical team to start the investigatory process into the redesign of the battery pack. A lack of time to properly solicit for and evaluate other battery pack designs has prompted us to go with the most feasible and subsequently cost effective battery pack design that can meet our time schedule.<BR><BR>10.	INTERESTED SOURCES<BR>a) Sonic Concepts, Inc. submitted preliminary technical information in response to our technical team inquiry on a battery pack redesign, but their design resulted in a less reliable battery holder. <BR><BR>	b) An intent to award sole source notice will be posted on FedBizOpps.<BR><BR>11.	OTHER FACTS:<BR><BR>Price Fair and Reasonableness:<BR>In the past battery packs were purchased as part of the contract with the receiver developer, Sonic Concepts Inc.  These battery packs cost $375 each and consisted of seven lithium/thionyl chloride D-cell batteries (to achieve the desired battery life two packs were used at a time).  Total cost for batteries to the USACE for all of its research in 2007 was $677,000.00.  To reduce the costs in 2008 Sonic Concepts, Inc. suggested that the government directly purchase the batteries from Tadiran and they would produce a battery holder.  Total cost to the government under this proposed option was approximately $335,000.00.  After discussions with Tadiran and the USACE funded researchers it was decided that battery holders are less reliable than are battery packs (batteries are soldered and/or welded together to form the pack, in a battery holder batteries are held in place by springs, if 2 batteries disconnect power, and subsequently data, is lost). Saft Federal Systems, Inc. provided a quote for a 15 D-cell battery pack at a cost of $195.00 each for a total cost of approximately $150,000.00, a cost savings of more than 48% to the government over 2007 years costs.  In addition to the above cost savings, USACE is impacted by a tight delivery schedule for the packs. The first shipment of packs needs to on-site the first of May. Due to the Continuing Resolution Act (CRA) and SCT prioritizations funding was not obtained in a timely fashion to conduct the research on the battery pack before January and funding for contract award was not available until January. <BR><BR>As previously noted, we did purchase these same batteries in January 2008 under a sole source procurement with Saft Federal Systems, Inc. on contract number W9127N-08-P-0076 and the quoted price was $195.00 each, which is the same price we were quoted for this purchase.<BR>

<DESC>Justification for other than Full and Open Competition1.  Contracting activity:		      US Department of Veteran Affairs      Center for Acquisition Innovation - Austin      1615 Woodward Street      Austin, TX 787722.  A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs:The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Center for Acquisition Innovation  Austin (CAIA) plans to procure EMC backup solution.The VA OI&T sites in Hines, IL, Philadelphia, PA, and Silver Spring, MD have been configured to support the VA VACO and OI&T Exchange production applications along with other OI&T applications using EMC software technology that cannot be duplicated on non-EMC Symmetrix DMX hardware platforms.  The EMC Control Center product suite has been deployed to manage the VA OI&T storage infrastructure.  These functions have their maximum impact using the unique features of the EMC Symmetrix array operating environment known as Enginuity.  The data on the tapes can not be accessed utilizing any other proprietary backup application (Veritas, Commvault, HP, IBM, etc).  VA Central Office (VACO) applications utilize proprietary EMC backup solutions (TimeFinder Exchange Integration Module/TF-EIM & TimeFinder SQL Integration Module/TSIM) to backup their primary e-mail & Exchange environment. This includes the Secretary of the VA and his entire Executive Staff and Cabinet members (Deputy Directors, etc).  The TF/EIM and TF-SIM microcode software products are exclusive to the EMC Symmetrix DMX storage array platform.  The VA OGC (Office for General Counsel) and Justice Dept. have set forth special sequester mandates associated with ALL VA electronic media being backed up (this includes all VACO e-mail data being written & backed up to tape). At present there are approximately 7500 tapes (comprising 2.6 petabytes of data) that are under special mandate by the VA OGC  all of these tapes are in either EMC Legato Networker or EMC Data Manager (EDM) format.  The data on the tapes can not be accessed utilizing any other proprietary backup application (Veritas, Commvault, HP, IBM, etc).  OI&T has 5 EMC Symmetrix arrays distributed as follows:  Hines  1 Symm 8830, 1 DMX 3000; Falling Waters  1 DMX 2000, 1 DMX 3000; Silver Spring 1 Symm 8830.  OI&T have a requirement to replace the 2 units at Falling Waters and Hines with a single DMX4 at each location.  The 8830 at Silver Spring should be replaced with a new DMX1000.  This enables the VA to realize its Tech Refresh goals with minimal disruption and impact on the staff. 3.  An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.    FAR 6.302-1(2)(ii) and 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1).4.  Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above.  This is a brand-name procurement.  VA Central Office (VACO) applications utilize proprietary EMC backup solutions (TimeFinder Exchange Integration Module/TF-EIM & TimeFinder SQL Integration Module/TSIM) to backup their primary e-mail & Exchange environment.  This includes the Secretary of the VA and his entire Executive Staff and Cabinet members (Deputy Directors, etc).  The TF/EIM and TF-SIM microcode software products are exclusive to the EMC Symmetrix DMX storage array platform.  If non-EMC hardware were to be purchased to replace the current EMC storage arrays both the application data backup software infrastructure and the Storage Resouce Management infrastructure would need to be replaced.VA has a substantial investment in EMC ControlCenter and this investment can be leveraged to reduce the cost of acquisition, implementation, training and operation.  The ControlCenter server hardware already deployed in the three sites can be reused in an integrated enterprise solution to gain benefits in scalability, manageability and asset utilization.  The software acquisition costs can be significantly lower as well since VA owns most of the required components and would only need to purchase the additional functionality to enable the Symmetrix Virtual Provisioning feature.  The implementation process is also simplified given that the framework for ControlCenter is already successfully deployed at all the sites and need only be upgraded and incorporated into the enterprise design.  Since ControlCenter employs a single user interface, the VA storage managers are already familiar with the toolset and the need for training is minimized.  To implement & integrate a new solution to replace the existing one would require months of integration testing and would be an extremely complicated operation  cost of performing such this type of migration would be very expensive and will place the patient health care records in jeopardy.  It took 2 years to get the existing environment in a stable condition due to the complexity of the new VA Exchange architecture  migrating to a new storage platform would require a similar transition which would have a negative impact on the operation of the current VACO Exchange email environment.  Data protection requirements have continued to evolve to a point where the backup application needs to manage multiple tiers of data protection from tape, to disk, to snaps, across a variety of applications within both physical and virtual environments, comprehensive scheduling and policies, operational and disaster recovery scenarios.  The VA OGC (Office for General Counsel) and Justice Department have set forth special sequester mandates associated with ALL VA electronic media being backed up (this includes all VACO e-mail data being written & backed up to tape).  At present there are approximately 7,500 tapes (comprising 2.6 petabytes of data) that are under special mandate by the VA OGC  all of these tapes are in either EMC Legato Networker or EMC Data Manager (EDM) format.  The data on the tapes can not be accessed utilizing any other proprietary backup application (Veritas, Commvault, HP, IBM, etc).  The cost associated with migrating the data from the 7,500 tapes to another format would be in the millions (approximately $3.4 million) and will result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and will cause unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements.  The NetWorker and EDM backup environments (due to the manner in which these environments were deployed and setup in the VA) require the use of an EMC Symmetrix storage system in order to function. 5.  Efforts to Solicit Potential Sources; Market Research Conducted; and Sources which expressed interest in writing:  The VA looked at several vendors products to see which one would meet the requirements the best.  However; in order to deploy new backup solution, the VA will have to purchase new software and new network management servers will need to be build and configure.  Additional hardware and extra man-hours needed to make it work will result in substantial duplication of cost to the government that will not be recovered through competition--VA could not justify the extra expense.6.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable.  The Contracting Officer has determined that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable based on historical data, price analysis, and negotiations.Market research was conducted by the program office and the contracting officer.  The market research identified numerous vendors that offer this brand name product.  The price is determined fair and reasonable based on adequate competition.7.  Other Supporting Data:  Although other tools might be used, EMC provides the best chance for success due to its cost and tight fit/integration with current product it provides.  A sizeable amount of effort would be needed to use another tool and will result in substantial duplication of cost to the government that will not be recovered through competition.

<p>
<p>Duties include but are not limited to:&nbsp;</p>
</p>
<p>A. BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>In September 2000, the Executive Staff of the Federal Bureau of Prisons approved a concept which would initiate a pilot program of multi-faith Residential Re-entry Program. This voluntary program, Life Connections, will initially be located in five institutions in various regions of the country. The program will be available to men and women inmates.</p>
<p>The program provides inmates with opportunities for spiritual growth and deepening their religious roots by sharing common space and programs for the purpose of personal transformation and reducing recidivism. Inmates participate in religion specific and multi-faith program components designed to bring restoration with God, family, community, and self. The program's design increases religious tolerance and respect among inmates of various faiths; connects each inmate with a spiritual mentor; and links participants with a faith community at their release destination in order to enhance community reintegration. Another component of the program initiates specific Victim Impact programs to assist inmates in claiming responsibility for their actions and making amends with victims, family, and community.</p>
<p>The program enlists partnerships with individuals and organizations in its efforts to lower recidivism and facilitate spiritual growth and personal change. Volunteers, contractors, mentors, sponsoring religious congregations and organizations are all essential partners in the program.</p>
<p>The goal of the Bureau of Prisons Residential Life Connections Program is to provide inmates living in a shared living space with intensive opportunities for holistic life restoration for the purpose of reducing recidivism and enhancing prison management.</p>
<p align="justify">B. SUBJECT:</p>
<p align="justify">Acquisition of a Community Liaison who will assist in the recruitment and training of a broad spectrum of religious congregations and civic organizations to serve both as incarceration phase mentors and others as post-incarceration phase mentors for inmate participants in the Life Connections Program. The relationship between the incarceration phase mentors and the inmate participants will begin within three months of the inmate beginning the program and will continue at least until their graduation. The contractor will promote the Bureau of Prisons Residential Life Connections Program in the community at large in an effort to recruit and maintain relationships with re-entry mentors. This is a multi-faith program, so the contractor will be expected to foster relationships with a broad variety of religious communities on a nationwide scale.</p>
<p align="justify">The contractor will provide training for both sets of mentors prior to and during the time they are mentoring. They will also provide bimonthly follow-up reports on status of the post-incarceration mentoring for the first year after each graduate is released.</p>
<p align="justify">The contractor will develop and provide access to the Bureau of Prisons, a web-based data collection system to assist in tracking the progress of program participants after their release to the community. The contractor will work with the sponsoring congregations to gather data used in compiling information related to the baseline measures of the program.</p>
<p align="justify">C. PLACEMENT OF PERFORMANCE:</p>
<p align="justify">The scope of this position requires contacts with religious congregations and civic organizations nationwide. The contractor may operate from their home office location for approximately 10 hours each week and will be required to work at the pilot site here at the Federal Correctional Institution (FCI), Milan, MI approximately 20 hours each week</p>

<p align="justify">F. METHOD OF INSTRUCTION:</p>
<p align="justify">The selected contractor will be knowledgeable of program goals and will maintain accurate records of all contacts made related to the program. There are approximately 100 inmate participants at FCI Milan, each requiring a mentor willing to actively and personally mentor the participant during the incarceration phase of the program and a post-incarceration mentor who is willing to correspond with the inmate prior to release and then actively and personally mentor him/her for one year after his/her release from prison. Each inmate should be matched with an incarceration phase mentor within three months of the beginning of the 18-month program and also matched with a post-incarceration phase mentor within nine months of beginning the program. The contractor will also follow-up with the graduates when they are released to assure they are in regular contact with their mentors. The contractor will work closely with the Chaplain Program Manager and other program staff at FCI Milan to ensure that volunteers and mentors from a broad spectrum of religious communities are available to meet the needs of this multi-faith program. The contractor will supply a Community Liaison at FCI Milan to work approximately 20 hours per week in the institution and approximately 10 hours per week in a home office off site.</p>

<p align="justify">A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements and the badge will expire six months from the date of issuance. This process can only be used once for a short-term contractor in a twelve month period. This will ensure that any consecutive short-term appointments are subject to the full PIV-I identity proofing process. For example, if a contractor employee requires daily access for a three or four-week period, this contractor would be cleared according to the above short-term requirements. However, if a second request is submitted for the same contractor employee within a twelve-month period for the purpose of extending the initial contract or for employment under a totally different contract for another three or four-week period, this contractor would now be considered "long-term" and must be cleared according to the long-term requirements as stated in this interim policy.</p>
<p align="justify">(3) Intermittent Contractors:</p>
<p align="justify">An exception to the above-mentioned short-term requirements would be intermittent contractors.</p>
<p align="justify">(a) For purposes of this policy, "intermittent" is defined as those contractor employees needing access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for a maximum of one day per week, regardless of the duration of the required intermittent access. For example, the water delivery contractor that delivers water one time each week and is working on a one-year contract.</p>
<p align="justify">(b) Contractors requiring intermittent access should follow the Department's escort policy. Please reference the August 11, 2004, and January 29, 2001, Department Security Officer policy memoranda that conveys the requirements for contractor facility escorted access.</p>
<p align="justify">&copy; Due to extenuating circumstances, if a component requests unescorted access or DOJ IT system access for an intermittent contractor, the same pre-employment background investigation waiver requirements that apply to short-term contractors are required.</p>
<p align="justify">(d) If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the contractor will only be issued a daily badge. The daily badge will be issued upon entrance into a DOJ facility or space and must be returned upon exiting the same facility or space.</p>
<p align="justify">(e) If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the approval will not exceed one year. If the intermittent contractor requires unescorted access beyond one year, the contractor will need to be re-approved each year.</p>
<p align="justify">(4) An individual transferring from another department or agency shall not be re-adjudicated provided the individual has a current (within the last five years), favorably adjudicated BI meeting HSPD-12 and DOJ's BI requirements.</p>
<p align="justify">(5) The DOJ's current escorted contractor policy remains unchanged by this acquisition notice.</p>

<p align="justify">ii) Under HSPD-12, long-term contractors are contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or longer. The PIV-I identity proofing process, including initiation and adjudication of the required background investigation, is required for all new long-term contractors regardless of whether it is the current practice to issue a badge. The second phase of HSPD-12 implementation (PIV-II) requires badge issuance to all affected long-term contractors.</p>
<p align="justify">iii) For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package.</p>
<p align="justify">iv) In order to avoid a delay in the hiring process, components should request an Advance NAC Report when initiating investigations to OPM. Per OPM's instructions, to obtain an Advance NAC Report, a Code "3" must be placed in block "B" of the "Agency Use Only" section of the investigative form. This report is available for all case types.</p>

<p align="justify">For all systems handling such data, the contractor shall comply with all security requirements applicable to Department of Justice Systems, including by not limited to all Executive Branch system security requirements (e.g., requirements imposed by OMB and NIST), DOJ IT Security Standards and DOJ Order 2640.2E. The contractor shall provide DOJ access to and information regarding the contractor's systems when requested by the Department in connection with its efforts to ensure compliance with all such security requirements, and shall otherwise cooperate with the Department in such efforts.

<p align="justify">and verify each extract including sensitive data has been erased within 90 days or its use is still required. All DOJ information is sensitive information unless designated as non-sensitive by the Department;</p>
<p align="justify">5. Contractor-owned removable media, such as removable hard drives, flash drives, CDs, and floppy disks, containing DJB data, shall not be removed from DOJ facilities unless encrypted using a NIST FIPS 140-2 approved product;</p>
<p align="justify">6. When no longer needed, all removable media and laptop hard drives shall be processed (sanitized, degaussed, or destroyed) in accordance with security requirements applicable to DOJ;</p>
<p align="justify">7. Contracting firms shall keep an accurate inventory of devices used on DOJ contracts;</p>
<p align="justify">8. Rules of behavior must be signed by users. These rules shall address at a minimum: authorized and official use; prohibition against unauthorized users; and protection of sensitive data and personally identifiable information.</p>
<p align="justify">9. All DOJ data will be removed from contractor-owned laptops upon termination of contractor work. This removal must be accomplished in accordance with DOJ IT Security Standard requirements. Certification of data removal will be performed by the Contractor's project manager and a letter confirming certification will be delivered to the CO within 15 days of termination of contractor work.</p>
<p align="justify">b. Data Security:</p>
<p align="justify">By acceptance of, or performance on, this contract, the contractor agrees that with respect to the data identified in paragraph a, in the event of any actual or suspected breach of such data (i.e., loss of control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, access for an unauthorized purpose, or other unauthorized access, whether physical or electronic), the contractor will immediately (and in no event later than within one hour of discovery) report the breach to the DOJ CO and the contracting officer's technical representative (COTR). If the data breach occurs outside of regular business hours and/or neither the CO or the COTR can be reached, the contractor shall call the DOJ Computer Emergency Readiness Team (DOJCERT) at 1-866-US4-CERT</p>
<p align="justify">(1-866-874-2378) within one hour of discovery of the breach. The contractor shall also notify the CO as soon as possible during regular business hours.</p>
<p align="justify">c. Personally Identifiable Information Notification Requirement:</p>
<p align="justify">The contractor further certifies that it has a security policy in place that contains procedures to promptly notify any individual whose personally identifiable information (as defined by OMB) was, or is reasonably believed to have been, breached. Any notification shall be coordinated with the Department, and shall not proceed until the Department has made a determination that notification would not impede a law enforcement investigation or jeopardize national security. The method and content of any notification by the contractor shall be coordinated with, and be subject to the approval, of the Department. The contractor assumes full responsibility for taking</p>
<p align="justify">corrective action consistent with the Department's Data Breach Notification Procedures, which may include offering credit monitoring when appropriate.</p>

<p align="justify">The requirements set forth in Paragraphs a through c above, apply to all subcontractors who perform work in connection with this contract. For each subcontractor, the contractor must certify that it has required the subcontractor to adhere to all such requirements. Any breach by a subcontractor of any of the provisions set forth in this clause will be attributed to the contractor.</p>
<p align="justify">Faith-based and Community-based organizations can submit offers/bids/quotations equally with other organizations for contracts for which they are eligible.</p>
<p align="justify">Freedom of Information Act</p>
<p align="justify">The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and its amendments have resulted in an increasing number of requests to Federal Agencies for copies of Technical/Management and Business Proposals from other than Government sources.</p>
<p align="justify">The offeror should identify information in its Technical/Management and Business Proposals the offeror believes should be withheld from these sources, on the basis the proposals consist of "trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential" (exemption (b) (4) of the FOIA). This identification will assist in the decision by a responsible federal official to disclose or withhold the requested information.</p>
<p align="justify">If an offeror considers elements of its proposal to be exempt under FOIA, ensure the following notice is annotated on the title page of the proposal:</p>
<p align="justify">Elements of this document, as identified on individual pages, are considered by the submitter to be privileged or confidential trade secrets or commercial or financial information not subject to mandatory disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. Material considered privileged or confidential on this basis is contained on pages ____. The offeror must annotate each individual item it considers privileged or confidential under the FOIA exemption with the following notice: The data or information is considered confidential or privileged, and not subject to mandatory disclosure under the FOIA. All information in an offeror's proposal not designated may be subject to automatic public disclosure if it is requested under the FOIA. It must be emphasized that under the FOIA no information is automatically exempt from public disclosure. However, no disclosures will be made without careful evaluation, giving due regard to the need for</p>
<p align="justify">safeguarding material considered privileged or confidential by the offeror. It is Department of Justice policy to withhold whenever possible material that is genuinely privileged or confidential.</p>

The Contractor must be capable of performing all the tasks described in the Statement of Work.

Employment and staffing difficulties shall not be justification for failure to meet established schedules, and if such difficulties impair performance, the contractor may be subject to default.

1752.209-74	Organizational Conflicts of Interest 

(a)	The Contractor warrants that, to the best of the Contractors knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which could give rise to an organizational conflict of interest (OCI), as defined in FAR 9.5, Organizational and Consultants Conflicts of Interest, or that the Contractor has disclosed all such relevant information.

SPECIAL BUSINESS QUOTATION INSTRUCTIONS

The Government anticipates that the work will be performed at the contractors facility.  
52.212-2  EvaluationCommercial Items (JAN 1999)
(a) The Government intneds to award a Best Value Firm Fixed Price contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation is determined by the Government to represent the best value and results in the lowest overall cost alternative (considering price, special features, administrative costs, etc.) to meet the Governments needs.  In determining which offer represents the best value and results in the lowest overall cost alternative (considering price, special features, administrative costs, etc.) to meet the Governments needs, the Government shall evaluate responses using the following factors in descending order of importance.  

1.	Technical Approach

The offeror will be evaluated on how it proposes to provide the printing services required.  The offeror should present their approach to meeting the requirements in sufficient detail to demonstrate their understanding of the project and to allow OPM to evaluate their approach. 

Your narrative should, at a minimum:

(1)	Indicate the initial plan to gain an understanding of OPMs operations needs;
(2)	Discuss the anticipated methodology to complete the work listed in the requirements;
(3)	Discuss methodology to meet the requested delivery time frames; and
(4)	Describe your strategy for dealing with potential significant technical, administrative, or managerial problems that could arise, particularly those issues that impact deliverable deadlines.

2.	Past Performance 

Your corporate past performance will be evaluated on the relevance of performance documented in submitted project summaries relating to type of work, complexity, and technical applicability of experience.

We will conduct reference checks in order to determine the offeror's corporate past performance.  In this regard, for each project listed, the offeror shall provide a point of contact (name and telephone number) to support past performance.  No more than three references are required.
The following considerations will apply to the evaluation of past performance: 

	Quality of Product or Service: compliance with contract requirements - accuracy of reports - and technical excellence.

	Timeliness of Performance: met interim milestones - reliable - responsive to technical direction - completed on time, including wrap-up and contract administration - no liquidated damages assessed.

	Cost Control: within budget - current, accurate, and complete billings - relationship of negotiated costs to actual - cost efficiencies.

	Business Relations: effective management - reasonable/cooperative behavior - flexible - business-like interest for the Governments interests. 

	Customer satisfaction: satisfaction of end-users with the Contractors services. 

Assessment of offerors past performance will be one means of evaluating the credibility of the quotation, and relative capability to meet performance requirements. 

Evaluation of past performance will often be quite subjective based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  It will include a determination of the offerors commitment to customer satisfaction and will include conclusions of informed judgment.  However, the basis for conclusions of judgment will be documented. 

If an offeror, or its proposed employees, do not have a past performance history relating to this solicitation, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on this factor. 
3.	Price

Price, while neither a weighted criterion nor a controlling factor, will be an important evaluation consideration in selecting a contractor under this Request for Quotations.

Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  As technical scores for the contractors become more equal, price becomes a more determinate factor.
	
(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. 

FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items (Feb 2009) An offeror shall complete only paragraph (b) of this provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES

1.	BACKGROUND: 
Founded in 1964, the White House Fellows program is America's most prestigious program for leadership and public service. White House Fellowships offer exceptional young men and women first-hand experience working at the highest levels of the federal government.
White House Fellows typically spend a year working as full-time, paid special assistants to senior White House Staff, the Vice President, Cabinet Secretaries and other top-ranking government officials. White House Fellows also participate in an education program consisting of roundtable discussions with renowned leaders from the private and public sectors, and trips to study U.S. policy in action both domestically and internationally. Fellowships are awarded on a strictly non-partisan basis.
The Presidents Commission on White House Fellows requires a contractor to provide overnight accommodations, conference space, audio visual equipment, meal services, and shuttle bus service (if necessary), in support of the annual selection weekend event, held during the second week of June.

The contractor will provide overnight accommodations, conference space, audio visual equipment, meal services, and shuttle bus service (if necessary), in support of the annual White House Fellows selection weekend event to be held June 9, 2009 through June 13, 2009.  Rendering of the services must occur before June 14, 2009 and include the following:

4.1.	Overnight accommodations
4.2.	Conference Space
4.3.	Audio Visual Equipment
4.4.	Meals
4.5.	Shuttle Bus Services

5.	QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN:

Note: the following Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP)  is OPMs codification of its method of implementing FAR 37.601, which requires that performance-based contracts or task orders- 

a)	Describe the requirements in terms of results required rather than the methods of performance of the work; 
b)	Use measurable performance standards (i.e., in terms of quality, timeliness, quantity, etc.) and quality assurance surveillance plans; 
c)	Specify procedures for reductions of fee or for reductions to the price of a fixed-price contract when services are not performed or do not meet contract requirements; and 
d)	Include performance incentives where appropriate. 

Offerors must complete the QASP as part of their proposal. A description of the columns and information to be entered follows below. 

We will use the information provided as part of our evaluation of your offer.

(1)	Deliverable: One of the deliverables described in the Deliverables section above.

(2)	Performance Standard: The level of performance which the Government considers acceptable. A good performance standard in general should:
&#61607;	Measure important things;
&#61607;	Be simple, but not too simple;
&#61607;	Be auditable and capable of validation (quantifiable measures preferred, as they are less subjective);
&#61607;	Attainable and worth the cost;
&#61607;	Have a level of detail that corresponds to the intent of the stated measure and expectation;
&#61607;	Be consistently combined with other measures to reflect corporate priorities; and
&#61607;	Be controlled by the contractor.

(3)	Acceptable Quality Level: The range of deviationif anyin which the Government will consider performance to be acceptable. Each offeror must propose an Acceptable Quality Level (AQL) for each performance standard for each deliverable. If the selected offeror fails to achieve stated AQLs, OPM will reduce the offerors payment for the services rendered in accordance with the disincentive formula. You must enter the AQLs for each deliverable in the Performance Requirements Summary Template for each deliverable that has a performance standard. 

(4)	Monitoring Method
(a)	This is the method OPM will use to monitor performance and determine the extent to which performance has met the standard. Offerors are encouraged to propose a sound process for verifying the accuracy of performance data on a continuing or recurring basis. Regardless of the method or degree of monitoring, we reserve the right to audit all performance data to independently verify its accuracy.

(b)	In general, we prefer monitoring methods that automatically capture measurements as part of the process and do not place a burden on either the offeror or OPM to collect and analyze data.

(5)	Incentive / Price Reduction 
(a)	For each AQL, your proposal must specify a maximum price reduction that will take effect if you fail to meet the AQL. The proposal must also specify the formulas and decision criteria that we will use to calculate the actual amount of price reduction for the related CLIN.

(b)	OPM is willing to consider proposals that include additional incentives for performance that exceeds the AQL. These incentives may be either monetary or non-monetary. 

(i)	For monetary incentives, your price proposal must specify a formula or set of decision criteria that we can use to calculate additional incentive payments to you. These incentive payments will only take place if you perform above the AQL. You must specify a maximum incentive payment that we will not be required to exceed, regardless of your performance.
(ii)	Some examples of non-monetary incentives that we would consider include, but are not necessarily limited to:
Revised schedule
Reduced oversight
Positive performance evaluation
Automatic extension of contract term or option exercise (FAR Part 17 still applies)
Lengthened contract term (award term contracting) or purchase of extra items (award purchase)
Publish article(s) in agency newsletter or speak at agency seminars
Letters of appreciation to individual employees, which may translate to bonuses
Use trade space for licensing, access to agency officials, etc.
Use those FAR clauses that can be negotiated to your advantage

(c)	Your selection of AQLs, incentive formula and price reduction formula will be important to our evaluation. Your response must specify the proposed method for measuring your performance against each performance standard, which we will compare to relevant industry benchmarks.

6.	OPM SPECIFIC CLAUSES

1752.205-70	Announcement of Contract Award 

OPM complies with FAR 5.3, Synopses of Contract Awards, in terms of synopsizing and publicly announcing contract awards. These actions take place at the time of, and not before, the contract is awarded. Contract award, in this case, means signature of the contractual document by the Contracting Officer and forwarding of the contractual document to the contract awardee. If the contract awardee wishes to make a separate public announcement, the awardee must obtain the approval of the Contracting Officer prior to releasing the announcement, and must plan to make announcement only after the contract has been awarded.

1752.209-70	Contractor Performance Capabilities
	
The Contractor must be capable of performing all the tasks described in the Statement of Work. The Government shall not be liable for any costs or other involvement in the purchase, repair, maintenance or replacement of Contractor items used to implement or comply with requirements of the contract. Likewise, the Government shall in no way be held accountable by the Contractor for the Contractors inability to perform under this Contract due to Government technology implementations and or changes.

1752.209-73	Standards of Conduct

(a)	Personnel assigned by the contractor to the performance of work under this order must be acceptable to the Government in terms of personal and professional conduct.  Contractor personnel shall conform to standards of conduct as follows:
	(1)	No contractor employees shall solicit new business while performing work under this order.
	(2)	The contractor and its employees shall not discuss with unauthorized persons any information obtained in the performance of work under this order.

(b)	Should the continued assignment to work under this order of any person in the contractors organization be deemed by the Contracting Officer to conflict with the interests of the Government, that person shall be removed immediately from assignment, and the reason for removal shall be fully documented in writing by the Contracting Officer.  Employment and staffing difficulties shall not be justification for failure to meet established schedules, and if such difficulties impair performance, the contractor may be subject to default.

1752.209-74	Organizational Conflicts of Interest 

(a)	The Contractor warrants that, to the best of the Contractors knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which could give rise to an organizational conflict of interest (OCI), as defined in FAR 9.5, Organizational and Consultants Conflicts of Interest, or that the Contractor has disclosed all such relevant information.

52.212-2  EvaluationCommercial Items (JAN 1999)
(a) The Government intends to award a Best Value Firm Fixed Price contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation is determined by the Government to represent the best value and results in the lowest overall cost alternative (considering price, special features, administrative costs, etc.) to meet the Governments needs.  In determining which offer represents the best value and results in the lowest overall cost alternative (considering price, special features, administrative costs, etc.) to meet the Governments needs, the Government shall evaluate responses using the following factors in descending order of importance.  

1.	Technical Approach

The offeror will be evaluated on the extent to which you understand the scope of work, and that your technical approach to accomplishing this work is sound to include the following:  provision of space, quality of services and overnight accommodations, confirmation of overall quality rating and location, meal services, and shuttle bus service (if necessary).   The offeror should present their approach to meeting the requirements in sufficient detail to demonstrate their understanding of the project and to allow OPM to evaluate their approach. 

Your narrative should, at a minimum:

(1)	Indicate the initial plan to gain an understanding of OPMs operations needs;
(2)	Discuss the anticipated methodology to complete the work listed in the requirements;
(3)	Discuss methodology to meet the requested delivery time frames; and
(4)	Describe your strategy for dealing with potential significant technical, administrative, or managerial problems that could arise, particularly those issues that impact deliverable deadlines.

2.	Past Performance 

Evaluation will based on your corporate experience (including results) with the provision of overnight accommodations, conference space, audio visual equipment, meal, and shuttle bus service contracts similar to this solicitation that the offeror has successfully performed in the past five years.

Your corporate past performance will be evaluated on the relevance of performance documented in submitted project summaries relating to type of work, complexity, and technical applicability of experience.

We will conduct reference checks in order to determine the offeror's corporate past performance.  In this regard, for each project listed, the offeror shall provide a point of contact (name and telephone number) to support past performance.  No more than three references are required.
The following considerations will apply to the evaluation of past performance: 

	Quality of Product or Service: compliance with contract requirements  

	Timeliness of Performance: met interim milestones - reliable - responsive to technical direction - completed on time, including wrap-up and contract administration - no liquidated damages assessed.

	Cost Control: within budget - current, accurate, and complete billings - relationship of negotiated costs to actual - cost efficiencies.

	Business Relations: effective management - reasonable/cooperative behavior - flexible - business-like interest for the Governments interests. 

	Customer satisfaction: satisfaction of end-users with the Contractors services. 

Assessment of offerors past performance will be one means of evaluating the credibility of the quotation, and relative capability to meet performance requirements. 

Evaluation of past performance will often be quite subjective based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  It will include a determination of the offerors commitment to customer satisfaction and will include conclusions of informed judgment.  However, the basis for conclusions of judgment will be documented. 

If an offeror, or its proposed employees, do not have a past performance history relating to this solicitation, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on this factor. 

3.	Price

Price, while neither a weighted criterion nor a controlling factor, will be an important evaluation consideration in selecting a contractor under this Request for Quotations.

Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  As technical scores for the contractors become more equal, price becomes a more determinate factor.

(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. 

FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items (Feb 2009) An offeror shall complete only paragraph (b) of this provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov. If an offeror has not completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at the ORCA website, the offeror shall complete only paragraphs (c) through (m) of this provision.

<DESC><p>During National Recognition Week June 20-24, 2009, the Presidential Scholars Program invites 141 graduating high school students, their teachers, and families to Washington, DC. The kick off event for NRW is the annual Welcome Reception held on Saturday, June 20, 2009 from approximately 7-10pm for the Commission, scholars, their families and their teachers.</p>
<p>The approximate needs are as follows:</p>
<p>An event space, which can accommodate a reception with a few remarks for 500-600 guests. Ideally the space will be located in or close to Washington, DC and the White House. The location should offer something of educational or cultural value, for example, a museum exhibit. The site should be able to offer security and clean up services as well as be open to outside catering services. The reception would occur approximately from 7-10pm.

<p>STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>FOR TRAINING, CONDITIONING, AND CIVILIAN OUTREACH SERVICES</p>
<p>Fleet Transition and Diversity Outreach Program<br />Naval Amphibious Base, Little Creek, Norfolk, Virginia</p>
<p>Commander, Naval Special Warfare Center<br />San Diego, CA</p>
<p><br />1.0 Background. Global War on Terror requirements has prompted efforts to grow the Naval Special Warfare (NSW) force. Consequently, Naval Special Warfare has targeted a 25% increase in the Sea, Air, and Land (SEAL) force by 2012. An additional objective is to increase the diversity of the Force as it conducts missions throughout the globe. A key element of candidate preparation centers on swimming skills and experience. Efforts are required to offer programs for Fleet sailors and civilian candidates to better improve swimming skills and thus become more competitive for SEAL training. This is of particular interest in minority communities where, historically, swimming has often been less emphasized as a sport or activity. As part of the effort to support this requirement, the Naval Special Warfare Center has developed the Fleet Transition and Diversity Outreach Program with a pilot effort being undertaken at the Naval Amphibious Base, Little Creek, at Norfolk, Virginia.</p>
<p>There are two missions of the Fleet Transition and Diversity Outreach Program. One is to train, mentor and coach prospective NSW students in NSW-specific core physical and mental skills, with particular emphasis on the swimming portion, culminating in higher physical preparedness, as indicated by successful completion of an elevated Physical Screening Test (PST) score. The other is to work closely with community leaders to identify potential minority candidates for Naval Special Warfare and to assist their preparation by enhancing swimming skills. Since success in NSW training programs is significantly higher for physically prepared students, this program will positively impact candidate success and minority accession rates.</p>
<p>This Statement of Work (SOW) is designed to meet the requirement to provide high quality swimming and physical training to Fleet and civilian candidates by offering professionally and technically experienced training while simultaneously conducting focused minority outreach.</p>
<p>2.0 Performance Based Work Statement. This Statement of Work describes a performance-based work environment in terms of "what" the required service outputs are, rather than "how" to perform the work. The service provider is encouraged to strive for constant improvement and innovation in the performance of this contract as long as the performance objectives are being achieved at the desired levels of performance. Successfully identifying and applying best practices can reduce business expenses and improve customer satisfaction. The service provider is required to manage the quality of the services delivered using their internal management structure. This SOW attempts to create a government-service provider relationship that promotes achievement of mutually beneficial goals, and promotes a partnership environment. The success of this contract is dependent upon free and open communication between the government and the service provider. The ultimate goal of this SOW is for the service provider to establish a quality program to NSW candidates in the Fleet awaiting training, and to outreach to the local Norfolk area minority community to enhance swimming skills for future NSW candidates.</p>
<p>3.0 General Duties of the Contractor:</p>
<p>3.1 The Contractor will provide an In-Fleet Swimming and Strength/Conditioning program and training services to Commanding Officer, Naval Special Warfare Center in support of the East Coast active duty recruiting and motivation team located at the Naval Special Warfare Center's detachment onboard NAB Little Creek, at Norfolk, Virginia.</p>

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is seeking Full and Open Competition for vendors that can provide quotes/proposals.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 05-24.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The synopsis, NAICS code  423490, is to notify contractors that the government intends to issue a Purchase Order  in accordance with FAR Part 13, for the following statement of work, under the simplified acquisition procedures.  Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the solicitation and any amendments.  It is the offerors responsibility to monitor FedBizOpps website for the release of any amendments to this solicitation.  Hard Copies will be provided to individuals eligible under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Rehabilitation Act upon request.  The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initiall offer(s) is/are providing Best Value and discussions are not necessary.

Project Title:  Nitrogen/Air Generators

Background:  The Office of Regulatory Science, Divisions of Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry, intends to purchase gas/nitrogen generators to support the development of analytical methods that utilize mass spectrometers and infrared microscopes.  At last count, there are over twenty mass spectrometer systems and one infrared microscope in our office that require dry nitrogen or zero air generation systems.  The generators will replace our current nitrogen/gas generation system, which utilizes gas from liquid nitrogen dewars.  
The current gas generation system has become unmanageable because of the large number of bulky, cumbersome dewars that we need on a weekly basis.  Dewars occupy significant space (about 12 square feet of floor space, and they stand at least 5 feet high) and are heavy and bulky.  They are creating significant space management issues in the laboratory.  They must be replaced at weekly intervals, requiring loading dock personnel to bring them to the laboratory corridors, and CFSAN scientific personnel must then move them into place for use with the appropriate instrumentation.  The gas generation rate of Dewars can be unpredictable, since they often leak at the same time they are supplying instruments, leading to many occasions when Dewars have run empty during the course of overnight experiments; it is almost impossible to run experiments over the weekend since we cannot be sure that gas will be available.  Dewars also tend to ice over with frozen condensation, particularly during the summer months, followed by melting and creation of puddles of water on the laboratory floors, leading to hazards.  Finally, a significant number of instruments requiring dry nitrogen have been added to the Office of Regulatory Science over the past 3 years, requiring the delivery of 9-12 dewars on a weekly basis.  This has created significant logistical issues, including management of the procurement of the dewars, which must be done on a weekly basis by CFSAN scientific staff.  Consequently, it has become imperative that we replace our dewars with standalone gas generation systems.




Requirements:   
  The following gas generators are required to address our needs:  QTY  1
1.	Dry air generation system: An existing Fourier Transform Infrared Microscope system requires a constant flow of dry gas to maintain proper experimental operation.  Dry, carbon-dioxide free gas is required necessary to provide a sample analysis environment free of interfering water and carbon dioxide, which can generate IR signals that mask important analytical information.  This is particularly important in IR Microscopy, where samples are examined on surfaces, and signal intensities are already low, making elimination of interferences necessary.  The gas generation system for this instrument:
a.	Must be a completely self-contained generator with a quiet, oil-free scroll compressor
b.	Must generate dry air at -100F dew point, <1 ppm CO2 (carbon dioxide), <2 ppm THC (total hydrocarbons)
c.	Must provide a flow rate of up to 1 scfm (1 standard cubic foot per minute, equivalent to 27 liters per minute) at a pressure of 80 psi (adjustable)
d.	Should use regenerative molecular sieve technology rather than replicable desiccants, to generate the purified gas
e.	Should have an integrated pressure gauge and flow control
f.	Should be enclosed to suppress noise


2.	Nitrogen generation system:  QTY  9  The Office of Regulatory Science currently has 17 mass spectrometers that utilize electrospray (ESI)/atmospheric chemical ionization sources (APCI) for generation of ions.  Each of these systems requires the use of dry nitrogen for the ESI or APCI sources. Typical flow rates requires are on the order of 10 liters/minute, but these rates vary from system to system.  However, in most cases, two instruments can be run from a single generation source.  We are initially requesting to purchase 9 such systems to address our immediate needs.  To address the needs for dry nitrogen for these systems, we require the purchase of nitrogen generators that can meet the following requirements:
a.	A self-contained system that occupies a footprint of 2-4 square feet
b.	Includes an integrated oil-free, low noise air compressor
c.	Runs on 120 V power
d.	generates nitrogen at flow rates of up to 30 liters per minute (slight more than 1 standard cubic foot per minute) at up to 99.9% purity (purity is adjustable)
e.	generates nitrogen at adjustable pressures of up to 110 psi
f.	uses a passive separation technology (for example, membrane)
g.	uses a carbon filter system for removal of hydrocarbons

3.	Combined nitrogen/zero air generation system:  QTY  2  The Office of Regulatory Science currently has three Applied Biosystems Mass Spectrometers that require dry, zero grade air and dry nitrogen for operation.  We require a generator that can provide both with a low noise, integrated compressor and passive separation system.  The gas generation must meet the following requirements:
a.	Must have an integrated oil-free scroll compressor enclosed in a noise suppression cabinet
b.	Must provide at least 10 liters per minute of dry nitrogen at 80 psi
c.	Must provide at least 20 liters per minute of  high purity (< 0.05 ppm total hydrocarbons), zero grade air at 110 psi
d.	Must provide 8 liters per minute of dry air at 60 psi
e.	Should deliver dry air at -40F dew point air or lower 
f.	Should use a passive (e.g. membrane) technology to generate the purified gas

Deliverables:
The contractor shall deliver Generators within 30 days.  

Warranty:  Warranty must be of the product explicitly stated.

CCR:  Vendor must be registered in the Central Contractor Register (CCR) prior to the award of the contract.  You may register by going to www.ccr.gov.  You will need to your Tax ID, Duns Number, Bradstreet number and banking information.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; fixed price proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is NAMA-09-Q-0036 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).

BACKGROUND: The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) has a critical need to expand its recruitment presence in the American Indian/Alaska Native community. Indeed, NARAs Strategic Plan calls for NARA to strive toward increasing the percentages of NARA employees in underrepresented groups to match their respective availability levels in the civilian labor force.  Currently, American Indians comprise less than 1 percent of NARAs workforce.  Traditional recruitment methods alone are not enough to address this problem; Federal agencies must look to alternative sources for American Indian applicants.  

In an effort to meet the expectations set forth in the Strategic Plan, NARA is seeking to partner with an internship organization that can assist NARA in expanding its outreach in the American Indian/Alaska Native community.  Specifically, NARA is seeking assistance in filling five vacant intern positions for the summer 2009.  The internships will focus on locating, researching, and organizing archival documents and records of particular interest to American Indian/Alaska Native communities.  Requirement CLIN 0001 total price for 5 summer interns

In addition the partner organization must be able to provide these services within sufficient time to meet the start date of the NARA summer internship program: June 1, 2009.  In particular, intern applications and other relevant materials must be available for NARA to review by March 18, 2009 in order to allow sufficient time for the interview and selection process.

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information contained in this notice. The procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.5. This announcement constitutes the formal Request for Quotation (RFQ) and a written solicitation WILL NOT be issued. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through February 2009 Federal Acquisition Regulation revision, which includes the consolidation of all Federal Acquisition Circulars 2005-30. This acquisition is NOT a small business set-aside and the NAICS code is 519120. <br /><br />It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM), to negotiate on a sole source basis with the British Library in Boston Spa, United Kingdom (UK), for continuation of indexing services under the current purchase order for journals published in the UK for citation in MEDLINE/PubMed. The British Library has provided such services to NLM for more than 25 years, and possesses staff members that have been fully trained to perform MEDLINE indexing. Using their own copies of journals published in the UK, <br />and using their own computer equipment and telecommunications system, British Library-trained staff will analyze journal articles for subject content and apply appropriate subject headings drawn from NLM's controlled thesaurus, MeSH (Medical Subject Headings), using the NLM's Web-based indexing system (to which NLM will provide access). The British staff members are trained in NLM MEDLINE indexing policy and have many years of satisfactory indexing performance from their staff. Use of this source would eliminate the need to train new indexers. Indexing will be performed following the policies and rules specified in NLM's MEDLINE Indexing Manual and technical memoranda. The journal articles are highly technical in nature, and require subject knowledge of the biomedical sciences in order to perform adequate subject analysis and indexing. The volume of indexing is anticipated to be approximately 32,000 journal articles per year. The period of performance is anticipated to begin on or about March 23, 2009 with options for four (4) successive one-year periods. All proposals received within 15 days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by NLM. Responses must be in writing and must be received in this office by March 19, 2009 and must include pricing information and meet NLM's requirement. This is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NLM to determine if the party can perform this requirement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have valid certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).
<p>NLM Synopsis No. NLM-09-077-UHP. EMAILS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTABLE. Firms interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide the professional services required by NLM.

<p>Statement of Work<br />VISTA Lost Alumni Recovery Project</p>
<p>Background<br />The Corporation for National &amp; Community Service (CNCS), is a federally owned corporation. Volunteers In Service To America (VISTA) is a program that is a part of CNCS. In partnership with state and local government and non-profit organizations, we administer National Service programs, including AmeriCorps, Senior Corps and Learn and Serve.</p>
<p>The CNCS mission is to engage Americans of all backgrounds in community-based service. This service addresses the nation's education, public safety, human and environmental needs to achieve direct and demonstrable results. In doing so, the Corporation fosters civic responsibility, encourages community teamwork, and provides education opportunity for those who make a substantial commitment to service.</p>
<p>Since 1964, more than 170,000 Americans served through VISTA. Today, nearly 6,000 VISTA members serve over 1,200 projects throughout the country-working to fight illiteracy, improve health services, create businesses, increase housing opportunities, bridge the digital divide, and strengthen the capacity of community organizations. <br />VISTA members leverage human, financial, and material resources to increase the capacity of low-income communities across the country to solve their own problems. When VISTA members complete their service, they leave behind lasting solutions to some of our country's toughest problems.</p>
<p>Volunteers In Service To America (VISTA), the AmeriCorps program fighting poverty, provides full-time volunteer members to nonprofit, faith-based and other community organizations, and public agencies to create and expand programs that ultimately bring low-income individuals and communities out of poverty.</p>
<p><strong>Objective</strong><br />The purpose of this requirement is to find current contact information for approximately 175,000 VISTA alumni. CNCS database of VISTA Alumni is incomplete and out-of-date. Currently, VISTA has little to no contact with alumni. This requirement will enable VISTA to build an alumni program as part of its overall outreach and recruitment strategies. This will also result in a mailing list for the upcoming 45th and 50th anniversaries of the VISTA program.</p>
<p><strong>Scope of Work</strong><br />VISTA is seeking a contractor to find contact information for alumni.</p>
<p>Task 1: Finding current contact information<br />&bull; VISTA will provide the contractor with an encrypted DVD copy of the VISTA alumni database, which is a Micro Soft Access file.<br />&bull; Using only public records, a contractor will find the current home mailing addresses of as many of alumni as possible, based on their social security number and name in VISTA's electronic database.<br />&bull; The contractor will use only public records and databases to retrieve contact information for VISTA alumni.<br />&bull; The contractor will deliver the updated contact information as an Access file that can be uploaded into our existing database.<br />&bull; The contractor will also let VISTA know which individuals are deceased by flagging them in the Access file so that VISTA will not inadvertently contact a deceased individual's family.<br />&bull; The DVD copy of the VISTA alumni database will be returned to VISTA and all personally identifiable information in the possession of the contractor must be destroyed-proof of this destruction must be provided to VISTA.</p>
<p><strong>Deliverables and Schedule</strong><br />This project shall be completed by June 19, 2009. The contractor shall complete and deliver the following:</p>
<p><br />&bull; Post-Award conference to discuss the execution of the Purchase Order and Task within<br />&bull; Maintain weekly meetings with Contracting Officer's Technical Representative throughout the project and acquire VISTA's approval before beginning each task<br />&bull; Deliver an uploadable, Microsoft Access file containing current addresses of all VISTA alumni that can be found.<br />&bull; Return the DVD copy of the VISTA alumni database and certify that all other personally identifiable information has been destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>Corporation Furnished Property (Facilities, Equipment or Services)</strong><br />VISTA will provide alumni names and Social Security Numbers (SSNs) in a Microsoft Access file on an encrypted DVD. Note: All work shall be performed at the Contractor-Site.</p>
<p><strong>Corporation Commitment to Response Time<br /></strong>The COTR and the contractor will determine an appropriate response time based on the specific tasks and deliverables (using the standard 10 business days as a reference point and not to exceed the 10-day reference point).</p>
<p><strong>Contractor Tasks/Responsibilities/Capabilities<br /></strong>Contractor is responsible for assisting VISTA in preparing documents to secure Office of Management and Budget clearance (if necessary) for this project.</p>
<p><strong>Security Requirements<br /></strong>Contractor must keep all alumni personal information secured, according to both FISMA and Privacy Act policies outlined below:</p>
<p><br />As a federal agency, the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) is subject to and complies with the security requirements of the Federal Information Security and Management Act (FISMA). The Contractor shall ensure that services and products provided under a contract resulting from this solicitation shall comply with the Corporation's information security program and privacy program policies, and Contractor Security Requirements available at</p>
<p>http://www.nationalservice.gov/home/security_and_privacy_policy/index.asp.<br />Contractor background screening requirements are included in the Security and Privacy requirements link above. In summary, contractors are required to complete the applicable background investigation request forms provided by the Corporation within 7 days after the individual's start date on the contract. If a contractor employee already holds a credential issued by a federal agency after background screening through OPM, the contractor may provide documentation supporting this status to the COTR. CNCS security officials will determine if the existing clearance can be accepted without further investigation.</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

52.232.9650  Wide Area WorkFlow-Receipt and Acceptance
USMC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW IMPLEMENTATION (AUG 2006)
  To implement DFARS 252.232-7003, "ELECTRONIC SUBMISSION OF PAYMENT REQUEST (JAN 2004)", the United States Marine Corps (USMC) utilizes Wide Area WorkFlow-Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) to electronically process vendor requests for payment. This application allows DoD vendors to submit and track Invoices and Receipt/Acceptance documents electronically.  
The contractor is required to utilize this system when processing invoices and receiving reports under this contract/order, unless the provision at DFARS 252.232-7003(c) applies. The contractor shall (i) ensure an Electronic Business Point of Contact is designated in Central Contractor Registration at http://www.ccr.gov and (ii) register to use WAWF-RA at the https://wawf.eb.mil site, within ten (10) calendar days after award of this contract or modification. Step by step procedures to register are available at the https://wawf.eb.mil site.
The USMC WAWF-RA point of contact (POC) for this contract is Ms. Judy Vinzant and can be reached at (760) 725-3418. 
The contractor is directed to use the "Combo,"  &ldquo;2-in-1,&rdquo; format when processing invoices and receiving reports 
When entering the invoice into WAWF-RA, the contractor shall fill in the following DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions:
(Contracting Office should fill in the following table at time of award to assist contractor with entering data in WAWF-RA)
In some situations the WAWF-RA system will pre-populate the &ldquo;Issue By DoDAAC&rdquo;, &ldquo;Admin By DoDAAC&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pay DoDAAC&rdquo;. Contractor shall verify those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF-RA system match the above information. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the contractor shall correct the field(s) and notify the Contracting Officer of the discrepancy (ies). Step by step WAWF-RA invoicing procedures for &ldquo;Combo,&rdquo; &ldquo;2-in-1,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cost Voucher&rdquo; are available at the USMC paperless site at http://www.marcorsyscom.usmc.mil/sites/pa/ under &ldquo;Vendor Interface&rdquo; section. On the Vendor Interface page click on &ldquo;WAWF-RA&rdquo; header at the top of the page. Under downloads on the WAWF-RA page that appears, click the appropriate document either &ldquo;Combo,&rdquo;  &ldquo;2-in-1,&rdquo; or "Cost Voucher&rdquo; to download the instructions. 
Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF-RA, but after submitting the document or documents, the contractor will be prompted to send additional email notifications. Contractor shall click on &ldquo;Send More Email Notification&rdquo; on the page that appears. Add the acceptor&rsquo;s/receiver&rsquo;s email address (Note this address is their work email address not their WAWF-RA organizational email address) in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF-RA system.  
 
NOTE: The POCs identified above are for WAWF-RA issues only. Any other contracting questions/problems should be addressed to the Contracting Officer or other person identified in the contract to whom questions are to be addressed.

<SUBJECT>EMC Captiva Software Maintenance 
<SOLNBR>TIRNO-09-Q-00B04
<RESPDATE>031009
<CONTACT>Craig M James, Contract Specialist , Phone 202-283-1196, Fax 202-283-4429, Email craig.m.james@irs.gov
<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This solicitation, TIRNO-09-Q-00B04, Provisions and clauses in effect through FAC 2005-29 Amendment 1 are incorporated into this RFQ. This procurement is a set-aside for Small Business. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 423430. The small business size standard is 100 Employees. 

CLIN 0001 Annual Maintenance for TEDS development, test and production environment including Dongle Keys 242863, 706306, 908510, T-7854, T-7849, T-7803, 102078, T-8529, and T-8526. Period of Performance is 1/01/2009 - 12/31/2009.

The IRS is seeking competitive RFQs for the following brand name requirement. EMC Captiva software annual maintenance"" the rationale is that this requirement is for the maintenance of critical EMC Captiva SW components that must be fully functional for the project to provide the designed functionality. The EMC Captiva SW must work with the Kodak & Fujitsu document scanners and provide the CSPC operators & data entry teams the ability to transcribe the information received. The Tax Exempt Determination System (TEDS) is a production system used by Employee Plans/Exempt Organization (EP/EO) Determination Specialists & Managers. TEDS was delivered with new COTS SW technology and significantly enhanced functionality. TEDS Release 2 provides functionality that will facilitate the processing of determinations with image scanning, electronic case management, and automated business rules. The EP/EO personnel involved in the determination process will be able to review cases through desktop or portable computing systems, replacing the current practice of hardcopy review only. Routing of cases between district and regional offices will be greatly enhanced as electronic data and images will be routed instead of paper. The EMC Captiva SW is already installed and operating in the IRS environment as described above. It would be too costly to procure new software, install and test the software, and have it operational immediately for use by the Service during tax season. This is an RFQ and brand name justification to procure EMC Captiva software annual maintenance. The IRS is not requesting information from resellers of other brand name but manufacturers that can perform the brand name equivalent. All manufacturers that can perform the equivalent function/services should submit their technical qualifications and literature.  

The following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provisions and clauses in effect through FAC 2005-27 are applicable to this procurement: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to offerors - Commercial, and FAR 212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, apply to this acquisition. Offerors shall include a fully executed copy of FAR provisions at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items, with their offer. FAR Clauses 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items, 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Order - Commercial Items applies to this acquisition. Per 12.603(b) the SF 1449 is not used. FAR clause 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities; 52.222-26, Equal Opportunity; 52.222-35, Equal Opportunity for Special Disabled Veterans, Veterans of the Vietnam Era, and Other Eligible Veterans; 52.222-36, Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities; 52.222-37, Employment Reports on Special Disabled Veterans, Veterans of the Vietnam Era and Other Eligible Veterans and 52.232-33, Payment of Electronic Funds Transfer  Central Contractor Registration. 

All responsible sources that can provide the above requirements and deliver all products shall submit written quotations no later than 10 days from the posted date of this announcement. The government intends to award a firm fixed price order. The Vendor shall be selected based on the lowest priced technically acceptable proposal. All quotes must include price(s); Quotes over 10 pages in total will not be accepted. All questions must be submitted by email to Craig.M.James@irs.gov.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to post the IRS response to questions received about providing services for this requirement.  

 Question 1: We request clarification as to scope of services requested.   Specifically, does the IRS require the Professional Services to configure the array, connect host and establish cloning?
 Answer 1: Professional Services is required to install and configure the array per IRS Enterprise Operations standards and EMC best practices.  The specific tasks are outlined in detail in the SOW section C.II.A.2 "Implementation Services for Detroit Computing Center CLIN 1".

Question 2:  What if a company is capable of performing the services required to install and implement the solution and has documented past performance implementing a DMX-4 as an EMC subcontractor and an EMC Proven Professional?
 Answer 2: As noted in the "Scope" section of the SOW, "Successful completion of these tasks will require extensive background with IRS Tier II SAN design and implementation standards, direct access to EMC engineering and existing IRS configuration information held by EMC, and full unfettered access to IRS facilities and personnel.  The skill levels of the personnel performing these tasks must be Subject Matter Expert for the following functional skill sets: Project Manager, Solutions Architect, Technology Consultant, Implementation Specialist, and Customer Engineer. The personnel also must have in-depth knowledge for integration between DMX storage, Tier 2 operational standards and data replication.  Engineers with EMC Expert Certification are required. ".  Furthermore, only EMC personnel are cleared for access to site, can configure modem dial-home access to the SAC and can work on the array without voiding the warranty.

<CONTACT>Kenneth C Brumfiel, Phone 757-893-2716, Email kenneth.brumfiel@vb.socom.mil
<DESC><p>The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to all of the questions that have been received:</p>
<p>1. Question: "On the frames, the proposal states 3 x 8.25 x 3 &lsquo;C formed channel'. Is this a stock structural channel size, or is it a fabricated structure with three individual pieces, continuous welded. I have found a structural channel MC9 x 23.9 that is similar, but not exact dimensions."</p>
<p>Each frame will be made from a &lsquo;C' formed channel of 3/8" thick hot rolled mild steel (ASTM A-36) in the following dimensions: 3" side by 8.25" base by 3" opposite side.</p>
<p>Answer: Yes - MC9 x 23.9 is acceptable. The stated dimensions are approximate in relation to standard CMU concrete blocks. The inside dimensions of the &lsquo;C' must be larger than standard CMU blocks.</p>
<p>2. Question: "On the Cart, similar question: Are the &frac14;" formed channels standard structural channels? I am looking at a C9 x 13.4 for the 8 ft runners and a C10 x 15.3 for the 30 inch tall vertical supports. Is this acceptable, or does the "C channel" require three pieces continuously welded the entire length?"</p>
<p>CLIN 0008: Firm Fixed Price (FFP). Frame Storage Rack capable of holding 7 filled frames, approximately 8 feet in length. Qty: 16, Unit of Issue: Each.</p>
<p>Answer: From the conceptual drawings provided at the pre-bid meeting (February 25, 2009), the vendor can interpret and submit a design that meets CLIN 0008 requirements. The government can work with winning vendor to optimize the design. Bearing in mind that these racks will be used to store and transport up to seven frames filled with CMU, the design and materials must be very robust.</p>
<p>3. Question: "On the &frac12; inch mount plates CLIN 0007, do I read this correctly, that on-site welding will be required to fit the 4 corners into the existing structure to match each frame?"</p>
<p>CLIN 0007: Firm Fixed Price (FFP). The contractor shall provide and install &frac12;" mount plates for the reusable metal frame. All welds shall be coated with zinc rich paint. Qty: 168, Unit of Issue Each;</p>
<p>Answer: There will be four plates welded into 42 opening; two on top and two on bottom. This is a clarification from the pre-bid.</p>
<p><br />4. Question: "Delivery in 60 days ARO, is this for the entire shipment, including potential on-site mounting of the &frac12;" mount plates (CLIN 0007)?"</p>
<p>Delivery: Delivery is required not later than 60 days after contract award, accelerated delivery is requested.</p>
<p>Answer: All frames must be delivered and all mounts must be welded within 60 days of contract ward. NLT day 61, acceptance testing (fitting frames into opens and attaching to mounts) will begin.</p>
<p><br />5. Question: "I attended the Pre-bid yesterday and asked the tall gentleman about the channel that is used for the breach walls. He stated that we could simply use MC channel. The drawings call for a formed channel 8 3/4" to the outside, 3/8" wall whereas a WC-8 channel would only allow approximately 7 1/4" inside. Does the channel need to have 8" flat surface at the bottom on the inside or can it have break radiuses in the bottom and be 8" the rest of the way up the 3" wall?"</p>
<p>Answer: See Question #1</p>
<p><br />6. Question: "I was going to go ahead and plan on hot dip galvanize the frames and storage rack. This should be better than zinc rich paint, but we can do it just about as cheap. An then cold galvanize the welds where we field weld the &frac12;'' thick mount plates in the field. Would this be acceptable?"</p>
<p>From CLIN 0007 (referencing that mounting plates): All welds shall be coated with zinc rich paint. <br />From Section C: All frames and hardware will be treated with a rust preventive black or gray paint.</p>
<p>Answer: Yes to all. Hot dip galvanize is a highly desirable rust treatment and would be an acceptable substitute for black or gray rust preventive paint.</p>
<p>7. Delivery/Installation will be made to Fort Story, VA 23459 not to NSWDG, 1636 Regulus Avenue, Virginia Beach, Virginia 23461-2299. A specific delivery address will be provided upon receipt of award.</p>

The purpose of this notification is to determine whether any competitive sources exist and to notify industry of any impending actions so that possible subcontracting opportunities may be pursued.Any IDIQ Contract resulting from this sources sought synopsis will be to acquire the non-developmental ATP-SE as a follow-on system to the AN/AAQ-33 targeting pod.  The ATP-SE is an external, pylon-mounted targeting pod and will be integrated onto the F-16, F-15, A-10, B-52 and B-1 platforms with the potential for integration onto other military platforms.  The targeting pod is capable of producing infrared and visible imagery of both ground and airborne targets.  The pod provides laser ranging and designation in support of weapon delivery, navigational functions, recording and data-linking of generated imagery and data.  The imagery will allow for greater stand-off ranges and increase target identification.  The Government does not contemplate providing any data or drawings related to the existing targeting pods already in the Governments inventory.

<p>&nbsp;Whether the nonmanufacturer rule applies to a concern which intends to provide an item manufactured by a large business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I. BACKGROUND [*2]</p>
<p>&nbsp;A. The Procurement</p>
<p>&nbsp;On January 9, 2004, the United States Marshals Service of the Department of Justice (USMS) issued the subject solicitation for the short term lease of narrow bodied (single aisle) large passenger/transport jet aircraft to perform its missions of moving federal prisoners and illegal aliens. The solicitation seeks to award three contracts, one at each of three different operational sites. The sites are Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Mesa, Arizona; and Alexandria, Louisiana. The contractor will lease the aircraft to USMS, and be responsible for aircraft maintenance and logistics. USMS will operate the aircraft.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The Contracting Officer (CO) set the procurement aside for small business, and designated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 532411, Commercial Air, Rail, and Water Transportation Equipment Rental and Leasing, with a corresponding $ 6 million annual receipts size standard, as the applicable NAICS code for the procurement. However, the solicitation also contains Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR or 48 C.F.R.) clause</p>
<p>52.212-1, stating the small business size standard for a firm which intends to furnish an item which it did not itself manufacture [*3]<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>is 500 employees. 48 C.F.R. &sect; 52.212-1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Offers were due on February 19, 2004. Amendment 1, issued on February 9, 2004, extended the due date to February 26, 2004. Amendment 2 was issued on March 3, 2004. Amendment 3, issued on April 2, 2004, announced the conclusion of discussions, and set April 9, 2004, as the due date for final proposal revisions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;B. Protest and Response</p>
<p>&nbsp;On May 6, 2004, the CO issued notices that the apparent successful offerors were Pride International, LLC (Appellant) for the Oklahoma City and Alexandria contracts, and Metscan Technologies, LLC d/b/a Prisoner Transportation Services (Metscan) for the Mesa contract. On that same day, Aviation Enterprises, Inc. (AEI) filed a size protest with the CO, alleging that Appellant was other than small, and identifying several alleged affiliates. On May 7th, the CO forwarded the protest to the Small Business Administration (SBA) Office of Government Contracting - Area V, in Dallas, Texas (Dallas Area Office). On May 14, 2004, the Dallas Area Office informed Appellant of the protest, and requested it to submit a response to the protest, together with a completed SBA Form 355 and certain other information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On May 19,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>[*4]<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>2004, Appellant responded to the protest. Appellant identified three affiliates: Cenla FTZ, LLC; Cenla Intermodal Transportation Group, and Rice and Rice, LLC. None of these three firms has ever generated any revenue. Appellant further asserted it had been adversely affected by the drop in air travel after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.</p>
<p>Appellant alleged its book value and number of employees are well under the small business size standards. Appellant asserted that correct size standard for the procurement was 500 employees, because the solicitation included the clause at 48 C.F.R. &sect; 52.212-1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On May 26th, the Dallas Area Office transferred the case to the SBA Office of Government Contracting - Area IV in Chicago, Illinois (Chicago Area Office) for completion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;C. The Size Determination</p>
<p>&nbsp;On May 27, 2004, the Chicago Area Office issued a size determination finding Appellant an other than small business. The Chicago Area Office found that Appellant is 47.5% owned by Frank B. Rice, its President; 47.5% by Carol B.</p>
<p>Rice; and 5% by Tom Welch, its Vice-President. Mr. and Ms. Rice are divorced. Mr. and Ms. Rice also each own 50% of Pride Flight Services, Inc. (Flight), located [*5]<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>at an address adjacent to Appellant. Flight provides airport services in Alexandria, Louisiana. The three affiliates identified by Appellant above are dormant and have never generated any revenue. The Chicago Area Office found Appellant affiliated with Flight, as well the three identified affiliates, due to common ownership.</p>
<p>The Chicago Area Office also found that the correct size standard for the procurement was $ 6 million in annual receipts, as the procurement was for the lease of an aircraft, and not the furnishing of a manufactured product. After review of the tax returns for Appellant and its affiliates, the Chicago Area Office concluded Appellant was other than small. Appellant received the size determination on June 2, 2004.</p>
<p>&nbsp;D. The Appeal</p>
<p>&nbsp;On June 17, 2004, Appellant filed the instant appeal. First, Appellant asserts the solicitation lacks the commercial service related clauses found at 48 C.F.R. &sect; 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to&nbsp; mplement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items; 48 C.F.R. &sect; 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting; 48 C.F.R. &sect; 52.219-6, Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside; or 48 C.F.R. &sect; 52.219-7, Notice of Partial<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>[*6]<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Small Business Set-Aside. The absence of these clauses means the procurement is not a commercial services contract, and not a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>Appellant argues this procurement is not a set-aside due to the absence of the clauses it identifies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Second, Appellant asserts the inclusion of FAR clause 48 C.F.R. &sect; 52.212-1 means the non-manufacturer rule is applicable to the instant procurement, and thus the correct size standard is 500 employees. Appellant argues this is a contract for supplies, not services. At the least, this creates an ambiguity which the CO failed to resolve despite three amendments and a questions and answers session.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Appellant also argues that a bidder may not be awarded a contract as a small business unless the firm agrees that at least 50% of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern, citing 15 U.S.C. &sect; 644(o)(1)(A). This required the CO to insert the clause 48 C.F.R. &sect; 52.219-14 into the solicitation, and the Chicago Area Office should not have ignored the failure to do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Appellant asserts it is a small business and, further, the solicitation is fatally [*7]<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>flawed, and requests this Office order the CO to issue a new solicitation.*</p>
<p>&nbsp;- - - - - - - - - - - - - - Footnotes - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</p>
<p>&nbsp;* Appellant also mentions its protest of Metscan's size. Issues related to that protest will be addressed in Appellant's appeal of the dismissal of that protest. Size Appeal of Pride International, LLC, SBA No. SIZ-4649 (2004).</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>- - - - - - - - - - - - End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - -</p>
<p>&nbsp;E. AEI's Response</p>
<p>&nbsp;On July 2, 2004, AEI Responded to the appeal. AEI argues that the instant appeal should be dismissed as an untimely NAICS code appeal. AEI further argues that the nonmanufacturer rule is not applicable here, as Appellant does not seek to provide a product manufactured by a small business, but an aircraft manufactured by the Boeing Aircraft Company, a large business.</p>
<p>Accordingly, AEI urges that this Office dismiss or deny the appeal.</p>
<p>II. DISCUSSION</p>
<p>&nbsp;Appellant filed the instant appeal within 15 days of receiving the size determination, and thus the appeal is timely. 13 C.F.R. &sect; 134.304(a)(1).&nbsp;Appellant has the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, all elements of its appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>[*8]<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Specifically, it must prove the Area Office size determination is based on a clear error of fact or law. 13 C.F.R. &sect; 134.314; Size Appeal of Procedyne Corp., SBA No. SIZ-4354, at 4-5 (1999).</p>
<p>A review of the solicitation reveals that it clearly states in its cover sheet that the procurement is a small business set-aside and the applicable NAICS code is 532411, with a $ 6 million size standard. The Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside clause (48 C.F.R. &sect; 52.219-5) is included at page 12, contrary to Appellant's assertion. If Appellant disagreed with that classification, or thought there was any ambiguity in the solicitation, it had 10 days in which to file a NAICS code appeal to challenge it. 13 C.F.R. &sect; 134.304(a)(3). Having failed to do so, Appellant cannot now challenge the solicitation's NAICS code designation in its size appeal. A size appeal which challenges the subject procurement's underlying NAICS code designation must be dismissed as an untimely NAICS code appeal. Size Appeal of&nbsp; ncobrasa Industries, Ltd., SBA No. SIZ-4557, at 5 (2003). Appellant had an additional chance to challenge ambiguities in the solicitation through three amendments and the discussion [*9]<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>process. It cannot do so now, after the CO has selected the apparent successful offeror.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Similarly, Appellant's argument that the solicitation should have included the clause at 48 C.F.R. &sect; 52.219-14 is again a challenge to the solicitation, and is inapposite to the issues in this size appeal, which reviews the determination by the Chicago Area Office, not the solicitation.</p>
<p>This Office has no jurisdiction to review and revise solicitations. See 13 C.F.R. &sect; 134.102(k). Further, the issue of whether an offeror has complied with the Limitations on Subcontracting rule (13 C.F.R. &sect; 125.6) is not within the jurisdiction of the size determination program, and thus not of this Office. Size Appeal of SDS International, Inc., SBA No. SIZ-4541, at 2 fn.3 (2003).</p>
<p>&nbsp;The nonmanufacturer rule is not applicable to this procurement. While the clause is included in the solicitation, it applies only in very limited circumstances. The concern must have less than 500 employees; be&nbsp; rimarily engaged in wholesale and retail trade and normally sell the item supplied to the general public; and supply the end item of a small business manufacturer in the United States. 13 C.F.R. &sect; 121.406(b). This [*10]<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>is not a procurement for a manufactured item, but for the lease of an aircraft. Here, as noted by AEI, Appellant will be providing an airplane manufactured by a large business. Therefore, even if Appellant's challenge to the NAICS code were timely, its argument is without merit, as it would not meet the standard for the nonmanufacturer rule.</p>
<p>&nbsp;A review of the record clearly establishes Appellant is other than small under the applicable size standard for this procurement. Appellant's own arguments assert it is a small business based upon its number of employees or its book value, and do not address its size under the applicable annual receipts size standard. Thus, Appellant has failed to establish that the size determination is based on any error of fact or law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Appellant has failed to establish clear error of fact or law on the part of the Area Office, and thus the Administrative Judge must AFFIRM the Area Office's size determination.</p>
<p>III. CONCLUSION</p>
<p>&nbsp;For the above reasons, the Administrative Judge AFFIRMS the Area Office's size determination and DENIES the instant appeal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the final decision of the Small Business Administration. 13 C.F.R. &sect;</p>
<p>134.316(b).</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">&nbsp;I. BACKGROUND [*2]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">&nbsp;A. The Procurement</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">&nbsp;On January 9, 2004, the United States Marshals Service of the Department of Justice (USMS) issued the subject solicitation for the short term lease of narrow bodied (single aisle) large passenger/transport jet aircraft to perform its missions of moving federal prisoners and illegal aliens. The solicitation seeks to award three contracts, one at each of three different operational sites. The sites are Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Mesa, Arizona; and Alexandria, Louisiana. The contractor will lease the aircraft to USMS, and be responsible for aircraft maintenance and logistics. USMS will operate the aircraft.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">&nbsp;The Contracting Officer (CO) set the procurement aside for small business, and designated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 532411, Commercial Air, Rail, and Water Transportation Equipment Rental and Leasing, with a corresponding $ 6 million annual receipts size standard, as the applicable NAICS code for the procurement. However, the solicitation also contains Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR or 48 C.F.R.) clause</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">52.212-1, stating the small business size standard for a firm which intends to furnish an item which it did not itself manufacture [*3]<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span>is 500 employees. 48 C.F.R. &sect; 52.212-1.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">&nbsp;Offers were due on February 19, 2004. Amendment 1, issued on February 9, 2004, extended the due date to February 26, 2004. Amendment 2 was issued on March 3, 2004. Amendment 3, issued on April 2, 2004, announced the conclusion of discussions, and set April 9, 2004, as the due date for final proposal revisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">&nbsp;B. Protest and Response</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">&nbsp;On May 6, 2004, the CO issued notices that the apparent successful offerors were Pride International, LLC (Appellant) for the Oklahoma City and Alexandria contracts, and Metscan Technologies, LLC d/b/a Prisoner Transportation Services (Metscan) for the Mesa contract. On that same day, Aviation Enterprises, Inc. (AEI) filed a size protest with the CO, alleging that Appellant was other than small, and identifying several alleged affiliates. On May 7th, the CO forwarded the protest to the Small Business Administration (SBA) Office of Government Contracting - Area V, in Dallas, Texas (Dallas Area Office). On May 14, 2004, the Dallas Area Office informed Appellant of the protest, and requested it to submit a response to the protest, together with a completed SBA Form 355 and certain other information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">On May 19,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span>[*4]<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span>2004, Appellant responded to the protest. Appellant identified three affiliates: Cenla FTZ, LLC; Cenla Intermodal Transportation Group, and Rice and Rice, LLC. None of these three firms has ever generated any revenue. Appellant further asserted it had been adversely affected by the drop in air travel after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">Appellant alleged its book value and number of employees are well under the small business size standards. Appellant asserted that correct size standard for the procurement was 500 employees, because the solicitation included the clause at 48 C.F.R. &sect; 52.212-1.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">On May 26th, the Dallas Area Office transferred the case to the SBA Office of Government Contracting - Area IV in Chicago, Illinois (Chicago Area Office) for completion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">&nbsp;C. The Size Determination</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">&nbsp;On May 27, 2004, the Chicago Area Office issued a size determination finding Appellant an other than small business. The Chicago Area Office found that Appellant is 47.5% owned by Frank B. Rice, its President; 47.5% by Carol B.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">Rice; and 5% by Tom Welch, its Vice-President. Mr. and Ms. Rice are divorced. Mr. and Ms. Rice also each own 50% of Pride Flight Services, Inc. (Flight), located [*5]<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span>at an address adjacent to Appellant. Flight provides airport services in Alexandria, Louisiana. The three affiliates identified by Appellant above are dormant and have never generated any revenue. The Chicago Area Office found Appellant affiliated with Flight, as well the three identified affiliates, due to common ownership.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">The Chicago Area Office also found that the correct size standard for the procurement was $ 6 million in annual receipts, as the procurement was for the lease of an aircraft, and not the furnishing of a manufactured product. After review of the tax returns for Appellant and its affiliates, the Chicago Area Office concluded Appellant was other than small. Appellant received the size determination on June 2, 2004.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">&nbsp;D. The Appeal</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">&nbsp;On June 17, 2004, Appellant filed the instant appeal. First, Appellant asserts the solicitation lacks the commercial service related clauses found at 48 C.F.R. &sect; 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to&nbsp; implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items; 48 C.F.R. &sect; 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting; 48 C.F.R. &sect; 52.219-6, Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside; or 48 C.F.R. &sect; 52.219-7, Notice of Partial<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span>[*6]<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span>Small Business Set-Aside. The absence of these clauses means the procurement is not a commercial services contract, and not a small business set-aside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">Appellant argues this procurement is not a set-aside due to the absence of the clauses it identifies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">&nbsp;Second, Appellant asserts the inclusion of FAR clause 48 C.F.R. &sect; 52.212-1 means the non-manufacturer rule is applicable to the instant procurement, and thus the correct size standard is 500 employees. Appellant argues this is a contract for supplies, not services. At the least, this creates an ambiguity which the CO failed to resolve despite three amendments and a questions and answers session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">&nbsp;Appellant also argues that a bidder may not be awarded a contract as a small business unless the firm agrees that at least 50% of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern, citing 15 U.S.C. &sect; 644(o)(1)(A). This required the CO to insert the clause 48 C.F.R. &sect; 52.219-14 into the solicitation, and the Chicago Area Office should not have ignored the failure to do so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">&nbsp;Appellant asserts it is a small business and, further, the solicitation is fatally [*7]<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span>flawed, and requests this Office order the CO to issue a new solicitation.*</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">&nbsp;E. AEI's Response</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">&nbsp;On July 2, 2004, AEI Responded to the appeal. AEI argues that the instant appeal should be dismissed as an untimely NAICS code appeal. AEI further argues that the nonmanufacturer rule is not applicable here, as Appellant does not seek to provide a product manufactured by a small business, but an aircraft manufactured by the Boeing Aircraft Company, a large business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">Accordingly, AEI urges that this Office dismiss or deny the appeal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">II. DISCUSSION</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">&nbsp;Appellant filed the instant appeal within 15 days of receiving the size determination, and thus the appeal is timely. 13 C.F.R. &sect; 134.304(a)(1).&nbsp;Appellant has the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, all elements of its appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span>[*8]<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span>Specifically, it must prove the Area Office size determination is based on a clear error of fact or law. 13 C.F.R. &sect; 134.314; Size Appeal of Procedyne Corp., SBA No. SIZ-4354, at 4-5 (1999).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">A review of the solicitation reveals that it clearly states in its cover sheet that the procurement is a small business set-aside and the applicable NAICS code is 532411, with a $ 6 million size standard. The Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside clause (48 C.F.R. &sect; 52.219-5) is included at page 12, contrary to Appellant's assertion. If Appellant disagreed with that classification, or thought there was any ambiguity in the solicitation, it had 10 days in which to file a NAICS code appeal to challenge it. 13 C.F.R. &sect; 134.304(a)(3). Having failed to do so, Appellant cannot now challenge the solicitation's NAICS code designation in its size appeal. A size appeal which challenges the subject procurement's underlying NAICS code designation must be dismissed as an untimely NAICS code appeal. Size Appeal of&nbsp; ncobrasa Industries, Ltd., SBA No. SIZ-4557, at 5 (2003). Appellant had an additional chance to challenge ambiguities in the solicitation through three amendments and the discussion [*9]<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span>process. It cannot do so now, after the CO has selected the apparent successful offeror.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">&nbsp;Similarly, Appellant's argument that the solicitation should have included the clause at 48 C.F.R. &sect; 52.219-14 is again a challenge to the solicitation, and is inapposite to the issues in this size appeal, which reviews the determination by the Chicago Area Office, not the solicitation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">This Office has no jurisdiction to review and revise solicitations. See 13 C.F.R. &sect; 134.102(k). Further, the issue of whether an offeror has complied with the Limitations on Subcontracting rule (13 C.F.R. &sect; 125.6) is not within the jurisdiction of the size determination program, and thus not of this Office. Size Appeal of SDS International, Inc., SBA No. SIZ-4541, at 2 fn.3 (2003).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">&nbsp;The nonmanufacturer rule is not applicable to this procurement. While the clause is included in the solicitation, it applies only in very limited circumstances. The concern must have less than 500 employees; be&nbsp; primarily engaged in wholesale and retail trade and normally sell the item supplied to the general public; and supply the end item of a small business manufacturer in the United States. 13 C.F.R. &sect; 121.406(b). This [*10]<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span>is not a procurement for a manufactured item, but for the lease of an aircraft. Here, as noted by AEI, Appellant will be providing an airplane manufactured by a large business. Therefore, even if Appellant's challenge to the NAICS code were timely, its argument is without merit, as it would not meet the standard for the nonmanufacturer rule.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">&nbsp;A review of the record clearly establishes Appellant is other than small under the applicable size standard for this procurement. Appellant's own arguments assert it is a small business based upon its number of employees or its book value, and do not address its size under the applicable annual receipts size standard. Thus, Appellant has failed to establish that the size determination is based on any error of fact or law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">&nbsp;Appellant has failed to establish clear error of fact or law on the part of the Area Office, and thus the Administrative Judge must AFFIRM the Area Office's size determination.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">III. CONCLUSION</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">&nbsp;For the above reasons, the Administrative Judge AFFIRMS the Area Office's size determination and DENIES the instant appeal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">&nbsp;This is the final decision of the Small Business Administration. 13 C.F.R. &sect;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">134.316(b).</span></p>

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY

This request is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, a Solicitation, and a Request for Quotes, or an indication the Government will contract for the items contained in the RFI. The Government does not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this RFI. The purpose of this RFI is to receive feedback from industry in regard to the following and is in support of market research. Information is being gathered to determine if more than one supplier has the capability to fully meet the Government's stated requirements.

The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is seeking interested sources capable of providing integration services to support the Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) Program.  
The mission of the CTR Program is partnering with willing countries world-wide to reduce the threat of WMD and related materials, technology, and expertise, including providing for the safe destruction of WMD, associated delivery systems, and related infrastructure.  Historically, CTR partners included states of the Former Soviet Union, but recent legislation has broadened the program worldwide.  Systems engineering practices and procedures are a critical component of these complex engineering projects, beginning from the design stage through project close out.  The CTR Program continues to dismantle and eliminate strategic weapons delivery systems and prevent the proliferation of weapons technology, materials, and expertise.  The CTR program also facilitates defense and military contacts to encourage military reductions and reform.  In the FY 2010 budget request, the Department of Defense expanded the strategic focus of the CTR program to support the Global War on Terrorism.

In FY 2001, the CTR Program awarded the current CTR Integrating Contract (CTRIC), an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract to five integrating contractors to support the CTR Program.  The ordering period ends on 06 September 2011, with all on-going work to be completed NLT 06 September 2012.  Future ID/IQ task orders whose durations are not appropriate to the period of performance of the existing CTRIC contract are expected to be awarded under a new contract.  In FY 2008, the CTR Program awarded a separate ID/IQ contract to support its Biological Threat Reduction Program (BTRP).  
In anticipation of the sunset of the current CTRIC in 2012, DTRA anticipates soliciting a multiple-source capability for an integrated approach to support the CTR Program in its non-BTRP operations and programs.  The maximum value of the proposed acquisition is currently estimated at $800M over a ten-year period (initial five-year contract with a possible five-year option award term based on performance.)  
The projected start date is January 2010.  Potential sources either alone or with appropriate teaming partners must have demonstrated expertise/capability in all the following areas. 

Provision of safe, secure, efficient, and accurate planning, organizing, management, integration, systems engineering, reporting, operations, maintenance, logistics, construction, eradication, decommissioning, extraction, dismantlement, handling, and transportation support to accomplish the following tasks outside of the United States;

Provide expertise on WMD non-proliferation and sponsor collaborative efforts between WMD development experts and their respective laboratory and research facilities;

Provide non-proliferation threat awareness and equipping, as well as non-proliferation and consequence management training and exercises;

Establish and maintain a comprehensive WMD detection and interdiction capability to promote interdiction of illicit trafficking in WMD and related materials;
 
Provide training needs assessments, curriculum development, and training support to fulfill contract objectives;

Assist in the development/update of Concept of Operations (CONOPS) for nations receiving CTR assistance;

Expeditiously perform CTR support tasks including travel support for government and contractor personnel, transportation of materials to partner sites, warehouse management, equipment and maintenance support, or short term procurement, construction, and renovation support for facilities and infrastructure required by the programs;

Eliminate WMD delivery systems and their support infrastructure (solid/liquid-fueled rockets and air-breathing weapons, bombers, submarines, and other platforms);

Dispose of the residual products and by-products of WMD delivery systems;

Eliminate WMD production facilities and their associated support infrastructure; 

Secure, store and account for sensitive items of WMD delivery systems and their warheads;

Design, estimate, construct, and demolish horizontal (e.g., trenching, roads and railroads) and vertical (e.g., buildings, bunkers, and towers) infrastructure identified in applicable task orders;

Provide vulnerability assessments, security enhancement recommendations, and implementation of USG-accepted enhancements at sensitive WMD sites/facilities;

Provide sustainment needs assessments including: maintenance and repair requirements, support equipment requirements, spare parts, logistics requirements, transportation, procedure requirements, or other related topics, as well as implementation of USG-accepted recommendations;

Provide assistance to the appropriate executive agent(s) or CTR designated representatives of CTR partner countries for the transport of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) to designated locations/facilities for planned dismantlement.  Establish and verify schedules and performance of transport services as well as establish and maintain key relationships associated with movement of WMD;

Provide Subject Matter Experts with expertise in the transportation infrastructure of CTR partner countries capable of detailed investigation into tariffs, regulations, certifications, ad hoc support requests or to attend project meetings between government agencies relating to the movement of weapons of WMD and/or associated components;

Provide ability to establish and manage contract(s) with transportation vehicle maintenance facilitie(s) to conduct and verify maintenance as required to maintain applicable certifications relating to WMD transport vehicles and;

<DESC><p>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. The information requested herein is for planning purposes and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued or contract awarded. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect cost or charges by the Government will arise as a result of the submission of information. Responses to the notice will not be returned. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with Government regulations.
<p>The purpose of this notice is to identify small businesses, which are capable of performing the potential work described below. For the purposes of this announcement, a "small business" is defined as an entity, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, and qualified as a small business under the criteria and size standards in 13 CFR Part 121. The SBA small business size standard for NAICS Code 541910, Marketing Research and Public Opinion Polling, is $7.0M.</p>
<p>The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) of The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), a bureau of the U.S. Department of Commerce, is required to conduct a survey of marine recreational fishing. This survey is to gather information on participation (number of who went marine recreational fishing at least once within the calendar year), fishing effort (number of angler trips), and catch (number of finfish caught, harvested, and released) by marine recreational anglers. The National Marine Fisheries Services (NMFS) seeks to partner with a contractor to provide NOAA Fisheries with the participation, effort, and catch statistics which are fundamental for assessing the influence of fishing on all stocks of fish. All data provided shall be loaded into the Marine Recreational Fisheries Statistics Survey (MRFSS) is a nationwide program developed in the late 1970's to provide a database of marine recreational fishing activity. The MRFSS consists of two independent, yet complementary surveys; a Coastal Household Telephone Survey (CHTS) to assess fishing effort and an access-point intercept survey to assess catch per unit effort. The data from the two surveys are combined to estimate the total fishing effort, participation, and catch by species.</p>
<p>A Statement of Work is attached.</p>
<p>The location from which the surveys will be conducted will depend upon specific requests and needs by individual NOAA programs, but may occur at any NOAA facility in the United States and its territories. NOAA has offices in every state and territory.</p>
<p>Small businesses are requested to submit a capability statement which clearly demonstrates their firm's capability and experience in directly providing the services in the Statement of Work.</p>
<p>Capability statements must not exceed 10 pages and shall include the following: a cover letter, identifying the point of contact, telephone number, fax number and email address; DUNS number; size and type of small business, including average annual revenues for the past 3 years; additional documentation such as company literature and brochures (a mere referenced website is unacceptable for purposes of this announcement and will not be considered or reviewed.).</p>
<p>In addition, please provide a list of at least three (3) relevant ongoing or complete projects awarded within the past 3 years. Relevant projects are defined as: contracts with a similar scope, size and complexity as this requirement. Include a project title, a detailed description of the services provided, contract amount, client identification including agency or company name, company address, telephone number, email and address and point of contact.</p>
<p>Capability statements must be submitted by close of business Tuesday, March 17, 2009 to the attention of Joshua Helms via email, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">joshua.s.helms@noaa.gov</span>. Reference the Sources Sought number in the subject line.</p>

Notice to Offerers: This procurement is part of the Navy's Contractor Evaluation System RED/Yellow/Green Program. Award will be based on the contracting officers decision as to which offer provides the best value to the Navy, price, past performance, and other factors considered. NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE SUPPLIERS (Apr 1999) (a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program. RYG is authorized by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Acquisition) for use in the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain and operate the fleet. (b) The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier w! hose quote represents the best value to the Government. As such, the basis for award will include an evaluation of each suppliers past performance history for the Federal Supply Class(s) or Service Code (FSCs) of the supplies and services being purchased. The price to be considered in determining best value will be the evaluated price after application of the Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEAs). (c) The procedures described in the clause entitled "Additional Evaluation Factor for Consideration of Past Performance - Navy Red/Yellow/Green Program (APR 1999), will be used to assist in determining the best value for the Government. ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION OF PAST PERFORMANCE-NAVY RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (APR 1999) (a) This procurement is subject to the Navys Red/Yellow/Green Program, authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and serv! ices used to build, maintain and operate the Fleet. (b) The purpose of RYG is to assist contracting personnel during source selection to determine the best value for the Government. The program uses accumulated supplier past performance data to classify each suppliers performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) as either red (high risk), yellow (moderate risk*), green (low risk), or neutral (no risk established). (c) To assist in source selection a monetary assessment in the form of a Technical Evaluation Adjustment (TEA) is added to each suppliers quote having a red or yellow classification for the FSC involved. The dollar amount of the red or yellow TEA assessment is based on the cost to the Government of effecting additional actions required to assure performance by a supplier with an unsatisfactory performance history for the FSC involved. No TEA is assessed for a supplier having either a green or neutral FSC RYG classification. For purposes of the RYG program, a neutral classification is assigned to suppliers who are!  first time quoters to the Government for the FSC(s) involved; suppliers otherwise having no past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved, and suppliers who past performance data in the RYG data for the FSC(s) involved are over three years old. After consideration of any other pertinent, price related factors (e.g., transportation charges, first article testing, and discount terms), the adjusted price becomes the basis for determining award. A suppliers FSC RYG classification may change over time as new or revised performance data becomes available. (d) RYG classifications are summarized as follows: (1) Green is low risk. No performance assurance actions are considered necessary. No TEA will be assessed. (2) Yellow is moderate risk. Additional performance assuring actions are considered necessary. A TEA will be applied to the prospective suppliers price to reflect the Governments estimated additional costs. (3) Red is high risk. Significant additional p! erformance assurance requirements are considered necessary. A TEA will be applied to the prospective suppliers price to reflect the Governments estimated additional costs. (4) Neutral is no risk established. No TEA is assessed; nevertheless, additional performance assurance requirements may be considered necessary to assure quality and on-time delivery. (e) RYG classifications for all applicable FSC(s) are established monthly for each supplier and provided to them. Suppliers may address questions about the program or their FSC RYG classifications to the Naval Sea Logistics Center (NSLC) Portsmouth Detachment, Federal Building, Room 400, 80 Daniel Street, Portsmouth NH 03801-3884, telephone number 603-431-9460, ext 464, FAX 603-431-9464. Suppliers may also access their individual FSC RYG classifications through the automated vendor access program. To obtain automated access, a written request must be submitted on company letterhead to NSLC at the above address. The request must include the requesters name, title, company name, address, telephon! e number and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code. The CAGE code is mandatory. In response, NSLC will provide each supplier, at no charge, an individual password, all required software, and information on accessing their individual data. REQUIREMENTS FOR ACCESS TO NNSY Contractors' representatives must be United States citizens. Representatives are to provide the NNSY Security Office proof of U.S. citizenship (i.e. DHS I-9 FORM. "Employee Eligibility Verification Form.") The I-9 is based on presentation of appropriate documentation that both verifies the employee's eligibility for employment and denotes his citizenship status. Contractors can go to http://www.nnsy1.navy.mil/Security/docs/i-9.pdf to acquire the required form and completion guidance. NOTE: (1) The I-9 must be provided before a badge will be issued for unclassified contract work, for access to the shipyard. (2) If the contract requires access to classified material, a visit request identifying the empl! oyee's clearance status may suffice depending on the employee's status within the JPAS database. (3) In the case of contractor truck drivers, knowing some are owner operators, if they are carrying proof of citizenship they can be issued a badge for access to drop off/pick up material. (4) If the truck driver does not have sufficient documentation and the sponsor is willing to escort the driver to/from the desired location, a by-escort badge may be issued. VENDORS/CONTRACTORS SHALL FORWARD ALL VISIT REQUESTS ON THEIR COMPANY LETTERHEAD SIGNED BY AN AUTHORIZED COMPANY OFFICER. Vendors/contractors shall provide FULL name, FULL SSN, Date of Birth, Place of Birth and a specific statement attesting that the person(s) for whom they are requesting access are citizens of the United States. By so stating, the vendor/contractor is certifying that they have positive documentation of that person's citizenship on file (i.e. a signed and verified EEVF I-9 form). The request shall also state the specific reason for the visit request and the specific date(s) f! or which they are requesting access to Norfolk Naval Shipyard (i.e., date of delivery).

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541380   The purpose of this amendment is to provide the Questions and Answers to vendors.Questions and AnswersEnergy Star TestingRFQ-DC-09---320January 15, 2009
Q1. "EPA's Office of Inspector General (OIG) has a requirement for testing of 40 to 60 Energy Star Residential Light Fixtures and 40 to 60 Energy Star Compact Fluorescent Light Bulbs". Does this mean 40-60 individual fixtures and individual lamps or 40 to 60 models of fixtures and models of lamps?
A1.  This would be 40-60 models of fixtures and bulbs.
Q2.  Energy Star specifications state a required sample size for each testing performance parameter.  Will this Performance Work Statement (PWS) require the same sample sizes or will they be different?  Can you specify the sample sizes?
A2.  The sample size will be the same as provided in the product's Energy Star specifications.		Q3.  "All offerors shall submit a fixed rate per test quotation" - Does fixed rate per test quotation mean a separate quotation is required for each performance test parameter or a separate quotation for each product model for testing all performance parameters or one quotation for the entire RFQ?
A3. A separate quotation for each performance test parameter is preferred; however, a separate quotation for each product model for testing all performance parameters is acceptable.
Q4.  "All questions concerning this RFP must be submitted via e-mail to the Contracting Officer only at  gosnell.jody@epa.gov by 2:00 pm on January 15, 2009."  When can we Expect a posted response to our questions?
A4.  Answers will be posted no later than January 16, 2009 at 4:00 pm.
Q5. Section 2.22 Conflict of Interest: Does our company meet the Conflict of Interest Requirements as stated in RFQ-DC-09-00320?
A5.  The vendor must comply with the terms of the PWS' Conflict of Interest requirements and submit the information requested. 
Q6.  Section 3.0 Objectives: "Repeat testing may be requested for some products after initial test results are received.  In addition, other Energy Star products may be tested if OIG determines a need to do so." Are the "Repeat testing" and "other Energy Star products" above and beyond the quantities listed in the introduction paragraph?  If so, can these be quantified as it could impact the cost.  Or should provision be made in the quotation?
A6. The "Repeat testing" and "other Energy Star products" are above and beyond the quantities listed in the introduction paragraph.  These cannot be quantified so provision should be made in the quotation.
Q7.  Section 4.1 Procurement of Energy Star Products: Is it expected that all products/model will arrive at the lab concurrently or will shipment and receipt be staged over time?
A7.  All Residential Light Fixtures will be planned to be shipped concurrently; and all Compact Fluorescent Lights will be planned to be shipped concurrently.
Q8.  Section 4.2 Testing  
A8.  The testing will be performed in accordance with the product's Energy Star's specifications.
Q9.  Section 4.5 Meetings - "4.51 The contractor shall be required to attend various meetings." "4.52 A time will be established for a monthly meeting." Will the various meetings require travel or will they be done by tele-conference?
A9.   Tele-conferencing will generally be utilized for meetings.  If travel is necessary, the OIG will travel to the vendor's site.
Q10.   Section 4.8 Dates - "Product testing for all products should be completed within six (6) months of contract award."
A10.    If the required testing, per the specifications, exceeds the six month period provided in the PWS, the testing period will be amended to account for the additional testing timeframes.
Q11.  Section 4.5 of the RFQ, mentions that the contractor shall be required to attend "various meetings," and "monthly meetings."  Can you please provide more details as to the location, scope, and expected number of the various meetings so that we will be able to properly account for these in our pricing.   Also, will all of these meetings, including the monthly meetings, be in person?  Can any of these meetings be done via phone or other electronic means?  If so, which ones and how many of the meetings?  A11.  Teleconferencing will generally be utilized for meetings.  If travel is necessary, the OIG will travel to the vendor's site.
Q12  Is the contractor expected to test all of the requirements of the Energy Star specification including tests such as electromagnetic interference (EMI), maximum mercury content, UL safety testing, and surge testing?  Please let us know if there any tests required under the Energy Star qualification that we will not be expected to perform.  
A12.  The testing will be performed in accordance with the product's Energy Star's specifications.
Q13.  The RFQ states that all testing must be completed within 6 months, and the all deliverables completed within one year.  However, there are a number of tests required under the Energy Star Specification that may take over a year to complete for various products (depending upon the rated life of the product), these include rated life lumen maintenance tests, interim life tests, and average rated lamp life tests. If a product is selected that will require longer than 6 months to complete the testing, will we be given a time extension on the contact to complete this work?  Should we base our price on the assumption that we will be testing only short-rated-life products where all testing can be done in less than 6-months, or should we assume that a representative portion of products will be longer-rated-life products, which will require longer testing period for some Energy Star criteria? 
A13.  If the required testing, per the specifications, exceeds the six month period provided in the PWS, the testing period will be amended to account for the additional testing timeframes.

<DESC>This announcement is for market research and does NOT constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Request for Information (RFI), or to otherwise pay for the information solicited. This RFI is issued for the purpose of gaining knowledge regarding the various types of environmentally friendly shuttle bus services available.
One shuttle bus would be required with seating capacity of approximately 20 passengers plus 2 wheelchairs. Buses must be accessible to individuals with disabilities. A back-up bus must also be available in case the main bus cannot be used.
The current contract for Shuttle Buses on the Environmental Protection Agency campus at Research Triangle Park utilizes buses run on only on gasoline. In keeping with the EPA?s mission, it is desired that the new contract utilize environmentally friendly vehicles. Furthermore, the current contract leases and maintains the vehicles while a separate contract provides drivers of the vehicles. It is the agency?s desire to combine these into one `turn-key? contract. 
The agency is interested in receiving information regarding companies that can provide environmentally friendly shuttle bus vehicles along with the required maintenance and drivers for the vehicles.
The primary function of the new contract would be to run a continuous loop on the Environmental Protection Agency campus at Research Triangle Park.  The route is approximately 3 miles and would be run from 5 AM to 6 PM each business day.  
Although a hybrid vehicle (i.e. gas-electric) is the agency?s preference, the term `environmentally friendly? can include various factors including the use of alternative fuels or anything else that can be shown to have less of a carbon footprint than typical gas operated vehicles of the same size. 
A demonstration of bus capabilities on our campus at Research Triangle Park would be welcomed. If a company wishes to set up such a demonstration please contact the contract specialist listed below.
The EPA requests that information on companies providing the above services be provided no later than March 13, 2009. Please include description of vehicles, driving services and maintenance information along with information regarding vendor?s business status (e.g. large, small, small disadvantage, minority-owned, 8(a), SDVOB, etc.).

<DESC>The Sources Sought is hereby amended to address the following:  

 

 

Questions shall be submitted via email by 05 March 2009, 5:00 PM EST.

 

 

Question:

I was wondering if you could tell me what types of modifications are required?   

Answer:

The existing equipment is used to detect aerosolized agents.  It is desired that this equipment be modified to be able to detect non-aerosol powders so the equipment can be operationally used by First Responders.  This would include a feasibility study and the development of an engineering design for the required modifications.   

 

Development of a BioFlash assay for powdered biological agent that minimizes inferences from commonly occurring powder materials is also required.   

 

 
Question:

And what evaluation tests need to be performed?  

Answer:

Initially, the response of the equipment when exposed to selected non-agent powders will be evaluated using one B-cell line.  This testing will be performed both with and without target agents present.    If prototype equipment is manufactured based on the engineering design that was submitted, additional interferent powder testing of additional B-cell lines would also required to be performed. 

 

 

Question:

Aerosol and non-aerosol releases were mentioned.  Does the testing require live agent aerosols or simulants?   

Answer:

Live agent testing of powdered biological material is required.  It is estimated that this testing would be conducted in collaboration with an appropriate BL-3 or BL-4 certified Government laboratory.  

 

 

Question:

I see that the response date is listed as March 8, which is a Sunday. Id like to confirm that this in fact the due date.

Answer:

Due date is 08 March 2009.  

 

 

Question:

Your RFI notice quotes from FAR 35.017-3.  In accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 35.017-3 Using an FFRDC, The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology (S&T) Directorate is seeking sources for a potential requirement to make modifications to the current BioFlash biological detection system that is manufactured and marketed by Innovative Biosensors Incorporated (IBI). Is it the intent to only have FFRDCs perform this work?

Answer:

Per FAR 17.504(e) Ordering Procedures, Nonsponsoring Federal agencies may use a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) only if the terms of the FFRDCs sponsoring agreement permit work from other than a sponsoring agency. Work placed with the FFRDC is subject to the acceptance by the sponsor and must fall within the purpose, mission, general scope of effort, or special competency of the FFRDC. (See 35.017; see also 6.302 for procedures to follow where using other than full and open competition.) The nonsponsoring agency shall provide to the sponsoring agency necessary documentation that the requested work would not place the FFRDC in direct competition with domestic private industry."

 

As a result, DHS is conducting due diligence, via Sources Sought/Request for Information, before utilizing United States Air Force (USAF) FFRDC Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Lincoln Laboratory.

<DESC>Questions and Answers on Pre-Solicitation Notice W912DR-09-R-0043<BR><BR>Q1. Im inquiring about whether this solicitation is the follow on solicitation to the following expiring contract: W912DR-07-D-0033.<BR><BR>A1. This pre-solicitation notice is not a follow on to an existing contract.<BR><BR>Q2. I was hoping you could inform me as to whether this is a new requirement or a follow-on contract.  If this is indeed a follow-on, would you be able to provide the information below? <BR>1. Contractor<BR>2. Contract Number<BR>3. Date of Award<BR>4. Expiration Date<BR>5. Awarded Amount<BR><BR>A2. See A1.<BR><BR>Q3. Are you able to release the short-list from the previous contract held for this solicitation?<BR><BR>A3. See A1.<BR><BR>Q4. Do you know if this is a new requirement or if there is an incumbent contractor (contract number?) / firm currently providing similar services? <BR>Also, would it be possible to learn contact information from the Program Office that is requesting this information (PM, address, phone numbers, etc.)<BR><BR>A4. See A1.  Information regarding current Indefinite Delivery Contracts (IDC) with the Baltimore District is available at the Baltimore District website- http://www.nab.usace.army.mil/contracts/. The requested information about the Program Office is procurement sensitive and can not be released at this time. Contact information will be provided to the selected firms.<BR><BR>Q5. Can you tell me if these services are currently being performed by contractors? If so, could you please provide the incumbent names as well as the Contract numbers?<BR><BR>A5. See A1. <BR><BR>Q6. Could you please confirm that the requirement that key management personnel and personnel in each discipline listed must possess valid current final Top Secret Clearances and that the firm making this proposal must possess a final Industrial Security Facility Site Clearance of Top Secret?  <BR><BR>A6. The requirements and selection criteria regarding personnel and facility clearances are identified in paragraphs 3(a) and 3(d) of the synopsis. Information regarding obtaining facility and personnel security clearances can be found at the Defense Security Services website: https://www.dss.mil/GW/ShowBinary/DSS/index.html<BR><BR>Q7. The contract is requesting that consultants have valid current final top secret security clearance to submit on this contract.  So if you don't have one then you can't submit and if your are not currently working for the corps you can't get one either.  Would assume that only the project manager would need this clearance?<BR>Do you know of any 8a, small business or hub zone companies that have these types of clearances?  <BR><BR>A7. See A6. The Baltimore District does not maintain a list of firms that have clearances.<BR><BR>Q8. My question is on the security clearance. I was separated from the army reserves in 2001, at that time, I held a Top Secret Clearance. I dont know who I can contact to update my security clearance as a civilian.<BR><BR>A8. See A6.<BR><BR>Q9. Our firm is interested in pursuing the above-referenced contract and I was hoping that some consideration would be given to amending the current requirement to be in possession of a Top Secret Security Clearance to include those firms that are capable of obtaining Top Secret Security Clearances. <BR><BR>A9. See A6.<BR> <BR>Q10a. Is it possible for an 8(a) without these clearances to team with a larger firm that has these clearances?  <BR><BR>A10a. See A6 for information regarding clearances. Decisions regarding teaming arrangements are at the discretion of the firm(s). <BR><BR>Q10b.The solicitation announcement states that because there will be more than one contract awarded, the successful firms will be given a fair opportunity to be considered for each task order award in excess of $3,000.  Are we to infer that task-orders will be competed among the successful firms?  Are we going to have to submit separate proposals for each task order?<BR><BR>A10b. The process by which successful firms will be selected for each individual task order is specified in paragraph 1 of the synopsis, & (1) All awardees will be given a fair opportunity to be considered for each task order award in excess of $3,000. (2) In making selection of the awardees to receive a specific task order, the Contracting Officer will consider past performance of previous task orders, and the Contracting Officer may consider the quality of previous task orders, timeliness of previous task orders, cost control, the firms strength and previous experience in relation to the work requirements, and geographic location described in the scope of work for each task order. When a project requires frequent or urgent needs that require an immediate response from the contractor, geographic location of the contractor may be a criteria used in the fair opportunity process for that task order. <BR><BR>Q11. Is there a list of firms that are responding to this solicitation?  <BR><BR>A11. A list of potential firms can be found on the Interested Vendors List tab on the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.fbo.gov) for this specific announcement. A list of the selected firms will be listed on the Baltimore District website following contract award.  <BR><BR>Q12. The Principals at my firm have had Top Secret Security Clearances in the past, and it would not be an issue validating them, but we didnt know how long that process would take. Would their clearances be renewed by the due date of the proposal? Should we even consider proposing on this contract?<BR><BR>A12. See A6 for response regarding personnel clearances. The decision to submit for this announcement is at the discretion of the firm.<BR><BR>Q13. If we do not have a final Top Secret Security Clearances:<BR>1. How do we apply for this level of security clearance? <BR>2. Where can I locate the necessary paperwork to apply for clearance? <BR>3. Approx. how long does the process take to receive the clearance, once our paperwork is submitted? <BR>4. If the clearance is not received prior to the March 27th due date, if we submit paperwork stating we have filed and will that be accepted?<BR><BR>A13. See A6.<BR><BR>Q14. Could you please let me know if we should send our SF certified mail or do you accept e mail?<BR><BR>A14.  Submission requirements are identified in the synopsis under paragraph 4 - Submission Requirements.<BR>

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) Office of Contract Operations in support of the Cutter Boat Over-The-Horizon Project Office as a means of conducting market research regarding the state of the market for two (Large and Medium) cutter boat designs. This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP), Request for Unsolicited Proposal, or as an obligation or intent by the USCG to acquire any products and/or services. The USCG does not intend to award a contract as a result of this RFI or otherwise pay for the requested information. The purpose of this RFI is to collect available market information that will be used to assist the USCG in evaluating its options related to its urgent need for cutter boat capability.

This RFI seeks principal cutter boat design particulars and operational features on vessels that are or are not currently in operation and have the potential to meet USCG requirements. Furthermore, these vessels shall meet the USCG requirements with or without significant development (e.g. integrate with parent cutter design). Information submitted must be based on: 1) proven currently in-service vessels that are capable of being built in the United States (US); 2) service vessels that are capable of being licensed for building in the US; or, 3) building a variant of the vessel capable of being licensed in the US. New and unproven (not in service) designs are of interest in this request and will be reviewed. The Cutter boats missions will generally occur in both littoral (coastal) and deep water (beyond 50 nautical miles from shore) and performing the following missions: Ports, Waterways, and Coastal Security (PWCS), Search and Rescue (SAR), Drug Interdiction (DRUG), Alien Migrant Interdiction Operations (AMIO), Living Marine Resources (LMR), Defense Readiness (DR) and Other Law Enforcement (OLE). When deployed, operations will generally take place 12 nautical miles or more beyond U.S. shores. However, the parent cutter shall transit and operate for limited periods of time throughout inland defined harbors, canals, or waterways navigable by seagoing vessels. Recognizing that proven designs may not meet all the desired requirements listed in section I of the below listed requirements or that proven designs could possibly be modified to meet the requirements listed below, proven designs within or near the range of characteristics identified in section I of the below listed requirements may be submitted for consideration. The information requested is intended to include, but not be limited to, engineering and operational design details, boat developmental history, operational history, user contacts and other information that would be helpful for making programmatic decisions. Specifically, the requested minimum and desired information is listed in section II of the below listed requirements. Any restrictive markings included on the data shall be clearly marked. In responding to this request, data and information (drawings, documents, tables, graphs, etc.) may be submitted in different formats and media (paper or electronic files). Costs associated with returning information shall be incurred by the provider of such information. Industry is advised that Governments support contractors (D & P, Whitney, Bradley & Brown Inc, DGIT, ARL, CACI, Analytical Research, EIS and BIG) will be involved with the review of submitted information. If a Government support contractor other than those listed above will be involved with the review of submitted information, each vendor that has responded to this RFI will be notified before their information is provided to the support contractor for review. All Government support contractors required to review the information will be required to submit non-disclosure or confidentiality statements. Submission of a response to this RFI is entirely voluntary. The voluntary submission of a response to this RFI shall not obligate the USCG to pay or entitle the submitter of information to claim any direct or indirect costs or charges or any other remuneration whatsoever. The USCG understands that any pricing information submitted under this RFI is an estimate only and is not binding nor constitute a proposal. Responses to this RFI can be submitted to Mrs. Linda Dearing via email (linda.b.dearing@uscg.mil) or hard copy mail no later than 31 March 2009. Responses received after 31 March 2009 may not be afforded a comprehensive review. Responses shall state if interested in design for the CB-OTH-MK V, CB-OTH-MK IV or both cutter boats, the name and telephone number of a point of contact having authority and knowledge to discuss responses with Government representatives. 

NOTE: Industrial Day will take place approximately 45 days following the posting of this RFI, the date has yet to be determined for Industrial Day.
