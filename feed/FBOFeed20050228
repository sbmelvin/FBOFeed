<DESC>This publication serves as a notice of intent to procure services, on a sole source basis, from the State of Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources, to co-manage the sanctuary and to provide public outreach services for the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary.  Services include marine enforcement, implementation of the management plan, create interpretive displays, promotion of whale education in statewide curriculum, perform humpback whale rescues and emergencies, and development and implementation of water quality parameters.  The Government intends to negotiate solely with the State of Hawaii, because they have responsibility for all state waters in the Sanctuary including aquatic and marine resources and: (1) are the only entity with authority for marine enforcement within state waters; (2) have permit authority for state parks; (3) the State Dept. of Education can facilitate curriculum development, testing, and implementation of statewide trials; and (4) has jurisdiction over water quality in state waters, which make up 80% of the Sanctuary.  Interested concerns who believe they can competitively and effectively provide these services must send their qualifying statement demonstrating their capability to perform the required services and demonstrating that they have authorization from the State to perform the services on behalf of the State.  Responses must be sent to the above address not later than April 14, 2005.  The period of performance is anticipated to be one base year, with four one-year option periods.  This notice may represent the only official notice of such solicitation.  See Note 22.

Offers may be submitted on company letterhead stationery indicating the National Stock Number, Nomenclature, Part Number and Unit Price.   NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the sam relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>CDC, NIOSH, National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory intend to negotiate with TSI, Incorporated for an Engine Exhaust Particle Sizer (EEPS), Model number 3091.  The Engine Exhaust Particle Sizer (EEPS) is an instrument that is necessary for the Diesel Team of NIOSH-PRL to fulfill our portion of the agenda set forth in the National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) multi-disciplinary nanoparticle research project.  The objective of the NORA nanoparticle research project is to identify and evaluate the nanometer and ultrafine aerosols emitted by diesel-powered equipment and formulate control technologies to reduce worker exposure to these particles, thereby reducing the associated occupational health risks.  The EEPS spectrometer measures submicrometer aerosols in the range from 5.6 to 560 nanometers in diameter. In addition, the fast response gives this instrument the ability to measure the transient behavior of aerosols that occur during engine test cycles.  These transient behaviors are more typical of diesel engine operation in the workplace environment and thus this fast response is necessary for an accurate characterization of the nanoparticles present in the workplace.  Firms that believe they can provide the required equipment are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the date of this synopsis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Please address all inquiries to Margaret L. Mooney at CDC/PGO/AAFB/Pittsburgh, (412)386-6431 or E-mail zia3@cdc.gov.  Simplified Acquisition Procedures requiring written quotations will be utilized.

<DESC>The National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the University of Rochester, Rochester, New York, to extend and expand the scope of their current contract for an additional five years.  The University of Rochester was originally awarded a five year contract in September 2000, for the project entitled “National Registry of Myotonic Dystrophy and Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy Patients And Family Members.”  The purpose of the contract was to refine diagnostic criteria, collect data, and promote the use of the Registry for separate clinical research projects. The Contractor was to collect and characterize an estimated 850 primary patient contacts for myotonic dystrophy (DM) and 410 primary patient contacts for facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) during the period 9/30/2000 to 9/29/2005.  The Registry will be enhanced as a national resource for information about myotonic dystrophy and facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy patients and family members.  The long term goal of this project is to provide a base of knowledge about population characteristics of families with a history of DM and FSHD, to provide access to this population for clinical research studies and trials, and to illustrate the values of web-based exchange of information about families with history of muscle diseases, while protecting privacy.  It is proposed that the number of patients and family members enrolled in the Registry be increased so that it will be a better resource for studies needing a larger number of participants for studies on DM and FSHD.  It is estimated that during the five year extension period, the Contractor will increase enrollment to approximately 1350 DM patients and 800 FSHD patients.  The Contractor will continue to provide access to these populations of patients with muscle disease for recruitment into clinical research studies and trials.  Additionally, changes will be made in the methods of data acquisition and analysis.  These analyses will better characterize variations in disease severity in affected individuals within families with a history of DM and FSHD. A determination for the use of other than full and open competition has been made in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  Inherent duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in performance make competition for this additional work unfeasible.  This is not an announcement of the availability of a Request for Proposals (RFP), nor is an RFP available.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the NIAMS.  A determination not to compete the proposed work based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541710.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for the manufacture and analysis of ten (10) additional Radiation Tolerant Intelligent Memory Stack (RTIMS) modules under existing NASA Contract NAS1-03064.  The contract is for the design, manufacture, and analysis of the  RTIMS.  NASA Headquarters selected the RTIMS teamed project, resulting in NASA Contract NAS1-03064, in response to the NASA Office of Earth Science (OES), Advanced Information System Technology (AIST), NASA Research Announcement (NRA) 02-OES-04.  The contract involves the design and development of the RTIMS physical hardware.  The design, fabrication, testing, analysis, and demonstration of a reconfigurable radiation tolerant heterogeneous stacked memory array based on state-of-the-art chip stacking, radiation shielding and Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technologies is required.   After design verification and validation of the prototype RTIMS module, ten (10) RTIMS modules will be manufactured and delivered to NASA/LaRC with associated analyses and documentation.	Since contract award, it has been determined that ten (10) additional RTIMS modules will be required to complete the environmental testing that is required to successfully meet the project’s goals.  NASA/LaRC intends to issue a contract modification on a sole source basis to 3D Plus USA for the manufacture and analysis of ten (10) additional RTIMS modules as defined above.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, “Only one responsible source”.  3D Plus USA was competitively selected as the partner on the RTIMS project, resulting in NASA Contract NAS1-03064, based on their extensive experience in designing and building proven mechanically rugged, radiation hardened, 3-dimensional interconnected, heterogeneous microelectronic modules for space application and its proprietary technology which enables the stacking of any kind of components in any available packaging.  3D Plus USA has played a key role, as a teaming partner, in the development of the RTIMS project and their unique skills are essential to the success of the project.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26.  An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.	All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the agency.  See note 22.

<DESC>The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with BD Biosciences for  a commercially available "off-the-shelf' Four (4) Laser Bench Top Flow Cytometer System (Blue, Red, Violet, Ultraviolet (UV)) under the authority of FAR Part 13.106-1 (b). This requirement for the ORD / NHEERL will utilize FAR Parts 12 and 13, Commercial and Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This acquisition is for one (1) Four (4) Laser Bench Top Flow Cytometer System (Blue, Red, Violet, Ultraviolet (UV)), to replace a Beckman Coulter EPICS XL/MCL flow cytometer, that meets the following minimum specifications: (1) HeNe (red) laser to permit the use of fluorescent probes and fluorochromes that are excited at the wavelength of 633-nm, (2) An expanded repertoire of available fluorescent dyes and probes for performing toxicological research with accessibility to both a UV laser (355-nm excitation) and a violet laser (407-nm excitation), (3) Access to Violet lasers in conjunction with the other lasers that will permit EPA to utilize the newly developed highly fluorescent particles called Quantum Dots, (4)  Table/Bench to accommodate the specified Four (4) Laser Bench Top Flow Cytometer System and peripheral equipment, (5) Computer, Printer, Software, and Monitor capable of running the entire integrated instrument, with CD/DVD writer for data archiving,  (6) Installation and test the entire system at the EPA NHEERL Laboratory to demonstrate that all specifications have been met, (7) Start-up and Training at EPA for a minimum of five (5) days, (8) On-site maintenance and/or repair warranty for one (1) year after acceptance, (9) Deliver the entire system FOB Destination, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina within 10 weeks after contract issuance, (10) Options for on-site maintenance and/or repair warranty for up to four (4) years after expiration or original warranty. The U.S. EPA believes that BD Biosciences is uniquely qualified to meet this requirement because market research indicates it is the only manufacturer of a Bench Top Four (4) Laser Flow Cytometer with four air-cooled lasers that meets the minimum specifications.  Utilizing the BD Biosciences instrument allows EPA to correlate immunophentyping of cells with the measurement and monitoring of cell functionality using fluorescent probes, dyes, and fluorochromes which are excited by lasers other than the 488-nm argon laser.   THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION.  However, any firm believing itself capable of providing the required instrument may submit technical documentation to establish its assertion.  Such documentation must be submitted to the POC within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses received will normally be considered solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  Documentation should be submitted in writing to Scott Tharp via Fax (513) 487-2109 or email Tharp.Scott@epa.gov.  Telephone responses will not be honored.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

All interested Architect-Engineers are reminded that in accordance with the provisions of FAR sect ions 19.7, 52.219-8, 52.219-9 or equivalent DFARS Sections, they will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practicable extend consistent with the efficient performance of the contract with small and small disadvantaged businesses.

If the selected firm submits a plan with less than the Corps recommended goals, it must submit, in writing, an acceptable rationale  why the recommended goals cannot be met, which rationale indicates that at the time the selected firm submitted its SF330 there was genuine belief that the goals would be virtually met and planning proceeded accordingly.  The Corps will negotiate the goal s if it deems appropriate, and will vacate the selection if it deems the firm was disingenuous in representing itself as committed to high small business subcontracting goals at the outset.  A detailed plan is not required to be submitted with the SF 330; however, the plans to do so should be specified in Block H of the SF 330.

The Defense Sciences Office is interested in new proposals for Robust Uncertainty Management (RUM).  The RUM Program will emphasize the development of mathematics and algorithms that guarantees performance by design for complex large-scale nonlinear federated systems.  The Department of Defense will often integrate a number of large, nonlinear subsystems to form a single system whose purpose is to perform a specific function.  The total system is composed of subsystems that are highly interconnected, simultaneously feature weak and strong nonlinear couplings, and are subject to resource constraints.  Typically the subsystems exploit different physical properties and mechanisms, and the subsystems will be governed by their own nonlinear dynamics across multiple temporal and spatial scales.  By its nature, the system is federated, distributed, and subject to uncertainty arising from incomplete knowledge of initial conditions, reducible errors arising from sensors, irreducible errors derived from modeling the physical system, as well as exogenous disturbances with an unknown distribution.  The primary issue is then to guarantee performance of the overall system and provide bounds on the performance of the system in the presence of epistemic and aleatory errors by design.  Guaranteeing performance is to be understood to mean that in the presence of partial or incomplete knowledge of the parameters or model describing the system that the values of specific state variables of the federated system can be predicted and maintained within a specified bound.  In particular the state variables of interest will be directly associated with the observable metrics of performance for the system.

The goal of the RUM program is to develop new mathematical tools that enable the design of large federated nonlinear systems with guaranteed performance in the presence of epistemic, aleatory, a priori, and a posteriori errors.  Intellectual effort should be directed toward a solution of the challenge problem that is described below.  The solution must be achieved by developing and employing a suite of new mathematical tools that enable analysis of the system, as well as incorporation of the analysis into a design for the system that guarantees performance.  These new methods shall be applied to either variation of the following cooperative surveillance challenge problem:  Consider N airborne sensors restricted to level flight at fixed altitude H.  Each sensor maneuvers in the altitude plane H and has a footprint on the ground of area A.  The N sensors need to perform surveillance of an area L squared with L >> NA.  It is further assumed that the sensors have a known constant probability of detection, pd and probability of false alarm, pfa against a single target class which is specified.  The sensors can determine if they are over terrain for which their probability of detecting a target is zero (i.e., an IR or visible sensor operating over foliage).  The challenge problems are for a fixed set of nonlinear dynamics between the surveillance sensors, what is the minimal connectivity between the sensors and the minimal time to guarantee surveillance of the area L squared at a specified Pd > pd and Pfa < pfa assuming a noisy communications channel while guaranteeing no collisions between the sensors.  The second variation of the challenge problem assumes a fixed noisy communication network and the objective is to define the interactions among the sensors and the dynamics of the sensors themselves to achieve the minimal time for surveillance while guaranteeing detection performance, i.e., a specified Pd > pd and Pfa < pfa, with no collisions between assets.

We would like to invite white papers and proposals that are far reaching in their implications, innovative, and ambitious in their goals and implementation. We encourage the submission of white papers and proposals that provide solutions to one or both of the challenge problem variations.  It is anticipated that to provide these solutions, research efforts will have to address one or more of the following areas: 
1.	New mathematical methods that will enable the development of nonlinear multiscale spatiotemporal models of physical systems that exhibit nonlinear dynamics.  We are specifically encouraging efforts that provide a methodology for the design of experiments in coupled nonlinear systems to support the development of models and which can characterize the effects of unmodeled dynamics upon the outputs of the model.  We strongly discourage methods that do not exhibit linear scaling with the number of parameters in the model.
2.	New methods that reduce the computational complexity of nonlinear models  resulting in a nonlinear model with less complex dynamics and for which the impact of reducing the model can be quantified by guaranteeing the performance of the system as well as providing bounds on the performance of the system as a result of simplifying the model.
3.	We are also interested in computational strategies that will minimize the computational costs associated with the evaluation of a nonlinear model while maintaining an appropriate precision in control or optimization applications. 
4.	Analysis methods and computational techniques that enable the propagation of uncertainty through coupled nonlinear systems.  In particular these new methods must be capable of accounting for branching in the dynamics, accounting for non-Gaussian probability distributions associated with parameters of the models, sensor noise, and initial conditions.
5.	New numerical methods for the estimate of the probability distribution function for the outputs of coupled nonlinear dynamical systems on multiple spatiotemporal scales that are faster and more computationally efficient than Monte-Carlo simulation or particle filter methods for a given non-Gaussian distribution of input parameters, model uncertainty, and reduction of the dynamics.
6.	Methods to control and, if required, optimize the performance of large federated nonlinear systems with dynamics on multiple spatiotemporal scales.

We strongly discourage white papers and proposals that rely on methods that attempt to linearize the dynamics and then apply established methods such as a Kalman Filter.  We are also discouraging white papers and proposals that attempt to solve the challenge problems by application of known nonlinear control methods and that do not involve the development of new mathematical methods. 

RUM is envisioned as a three-phase program that leads to the solution of the challenge problem by developing new methods for the solution of coupled nonlinear dynamical systems in the face of uncertainty.  Each phase of RUM will consist of a twelve-month period of performance.  In the first twelve-month phase of RUM, the focus will be the development of new methods focused upon the challenge problem variants.  At the conclusion of the first phase we expect to test the new methods by simplifying the challenge problem to a large coupled system that has linear dynamics and Gaussian distributions associated with the probability distribution functions of all uncertainties.  At the conclusion of Phase 1 the efficacy of the new methods will be verified by comparing their predicted results against standard techniques for these problems.  The second twelve-month phase may include a down-select of Phase 1 efforts.  The down-selection criteria may include success in the verification process described above.  The focus of Phase 2 will be in refining and demonstrating that the new methods developed for the challenge problem can be applied to the special case of a large linear system with non-Gaussian distributions of input parameters and produce results that are consistent with Monte Carlo or particle filtering methods but at reduced computational costs.  The final phase will consist of 12 months and may include another down-select based partially upon success in verifying performance at the conclusion of Phase 2.  During the third phase, the methods developed will be applied to the challenge problems leading to a design with performance guarantees in the presence of uncertainty, demonstration of design of experiments to produce complex nonlinear models, and the application of the design of experiments methodology to produce reduced complexity models whose effect upon the design can be assessed in the face of sensor errors and uncertainty in initial conditions.  Authors of white papers and proposals may include an optional task in which the system design can be tested experimentally.

WHITE PAPER REQUIREMENTS.  White papers must lead to a solution of either variant of the challenge problem and the solution must be based upon the development and application of new mathematics.  We strongly discourage white papers that focus on the design of new sensors, data collection efforts, linearization of the system, or application of known nonlinear control methodologies to address the challenge problem.  We are also strongly discouraging white papers and proposals that focus on experimentally determining conditions that lead to a solution of the challenge problem.  We encourage the formation of interdisciplinary teams integrated toward solutions to these challenge problems.  It is essential that the preparation of white papers include the following areas:
1.	A clear statement of the envisioned utility of the proposed research and development.  We are looking for revolutionary applications and goals that could be enabled if the proposed work is completed successfully.  The vision for the program should be long term and may exceed the period of performance while the goals and deliverables should reflect the actual period of performance; 
2.	A concise statement of the research challenges, approach, and potential anticipated solutions to the challenges that will be addressed.  This should include explicit timelines for which progress toward the goals can be determined and measured. Intermediate milestones of approximately 12-month periods with demonstrable metrics of performance must be included for the proposed work; 
3.	A cost estimation for resources required for the proposed timeline; and
4.	The white paper should consider phases of development as the challenges are met. 
White papers must be received by 1600 ET March 22, 2005.  Please put the phrase “Robust Uncertainty Management” in the title of the white paper.  If the authors of white papers choose not to submit electronically, U.S. mail may be used.  White papers will not be accepted by way of facsimile transmissions.  Authors of white papers will be notified by April 22, 2005, if a full proposal will be requested.  Full proposals must be submitted no later than 1600 ET May 23, 2005.  To facilitate the submission of white papers, a website http://www.sainc.com/dso0519/ has been set up.  For more detailed instructions on submitting white papers, please refer to the instructions for BAA05-19 found at the website http://www.darpa.mil/baa/baa05-19pt1.html.  Not withstanding the disposition of white papers, DARPA will accept full proposals for this addendum.

PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS.  Each proposal should: 1) explicitly address tests, demonstrations, and other research activities planned in the area(s) of interest described above; 2) include specific and quantitative scientific and/or technical objectives for each scientific/technical area of interest, for each phase of the program, addressed in the proposal that clearly demonstrate the research is on track for meeting the ultimate program goals; 3) include clearly delineated intellectual property arrangements and transition paths; 4) include identification and assessment of critical scientific and/or technical barriers to the program objectives and plausible approaches to develop solutions or overcome their limiting effects, and 5) a single viewgraph that concisely describes the; a) technical approach and research activities that are planned in the area(s) of interest; b) specific technical and quantifiable scientific objectives for each phase of the program; c) identification and assessment of critical scientific and/or technical barriers to the program objectives; and a; d) descriptive graphic.  The viewgraph must be submitted electronically in either Adobe pdf or Microsoft PowerPoint format.

Upon award, specific deliverables and appropriate level demonstrations of the science and/or technology elements will be required periodically and a final demonstration of the deliverable system is required at the end of the program.  Proposed Phase 1 efforts should not exceed 12 months.  Phase 2 and Phase 3 efforts should be planned for 12-month periods of performance, respectively.  If multiple awards are made, down-selection may occur annually based on technical progress and achievements.  Proposals with cost share should clearly identify the specific tasks to be cost shared in the technical proposal and separately break out the corresponding costs in the cost proposal.  The number of awards will be dependent on the suitability of proposals received and availability of funds.  Full proposals shall consist of two volumes: technical and cost.  The technical and cost volumes shall conform to the guidelines in DARPA (DSO) BAA 05-19 of February 8, 2005.  To receive consideration under this addendum PROPOSALS ARE DUE NO LATER THAN 1600 ET May 23, 2005, to the address shown below. Proposals received after that date will be considered under the open BAA but not this addendum.

EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS.  Evaluation of the proposals will be in accordance with BAA05-19.  For general administrative questions, please refer to the original FedBizOpps announcement, BAA 05-19 of February 8, 2005.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities(FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line(NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command.  The purpose of this synopsis modification is to revise the Government Furnished Property provided to the winning contractor, change the estimated release date, the type of CW-1181 Domes anticipated, and the response date.   1.) The Government DOES NOT intend to provide a mold as Government Furnished Property as originally indicated because this procurement is for urethane domes.  The mold that we own was originally designed for use on rubber domes. The Government will provide a drill fixture to the contractor, which can be used when manufacturing the CW-1181 Domes.  2.) The solicitation is expected to be released on or about 11/30/2004. 3.) NUWC Division Newport intends to solicit proposals for the production of CW-1181D and CW-1181E Domes.  NUWC anticipates a five year, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Firm Fixed Price (FFP) supply contract for a maximum of 200 CW-1181D Domes and 200 CW-1181E Domes.  4.) The response date is revised to 01/07/2005.  5.) All other terms and conditions remain the same.
Our department no longer issues solicitations or amendments in paper form.  Instead, they may be accessed at our web site

<DESC>A copy of this RFP is available at the following web site: http://www.niehs.nih.gov/dert/rcb/rfp.htm.

The National Institute of Environmental Health Science (NIEHS) is seeking offers to provide support to Principal Investigators (PIs) in the Office of Clinical Research (OCR) and Division of Intramural Research (DIR) at the  NIEHS for various types of clinical research studies and interventional clinical trials.  Examples of observational studies to be covered by this contract are case report and case series, case-control, cross-sectional, and prospective and retrospective cohort studies.  Interventional studies to be covered by this contract are: 1) efficacy trials of new treatments, new combinations of drugs, new approaches to surgery or radiation therapy; 2) prevention trials using various therapies, diet and lifestyle changes, vitamins, minerals, and methods to minimize potentially toxic exposures; 3) diagnostic trials aimed at developing better tests or procedures for diagnosing a particular disease or condition;  and 4) quality of life trials to explore ways to improve comfort or quality of life of individuals with a certain disease or lifestyle by modifying risk factors.  Observational and interventional clinical research involves carrying out many complex study tasks, all of which will be supported by this contract.  The design and implementation of each clinical research projects will be the responsibility of the Task Leader initiating the study, but advice may be sought from the NIEHS Project Officers, Contractor or a contracted panel of experts.  The extent of the Contractor's involvement with any given study may vary depending on the study design and support available in-house, through collaborators or other contracts.  For example, the Contractor might carry out only the surveillance and recruitment phase of a study, or only develop and administer study questionnaires.  Alternatively, the Contractor might only be involved in the treatment or sample collection phase of a study.  Some studies will require medical support for the initial subject evaluation, diagnoses, treatments, and follow-up care and this will involve providing medical personnel and facilities and/or interacting with medical personnel at other facilities including physician’s practices, clinics, and hospitals.  The medical institutions may be local or distant, and thus require travel by Contract personnel and/or study participants.  The Contractor might be required to coordinate activities with various reference laboratories, medical clinics or other institutions, and collaborators with NIEHS personnel.  Finally, all studies and/or tasks supported by this contract will be conducted according to all relevant federal guidelines and regulations.  Therefore, the Contractor will have knowledge and experience of all relevant guidelines and regulations for using human beings in research studies, e.g. 45 CFR 46 or the DHHS Common Rule, and those regulations for patient confidentiality such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1966 (HIPAA).  It is anticipated that a contract will be awarded with a base period of performance of four years with options to extend the period of performance up to a total of ten years.  Also, the solicitation will include, along with other evaluation criteria, a mandatory qualification criteria that must be met that is geographic restriction that the offeror(s) shall for the duration of the period of performance have existing or demonstrate ability to establish offices, equipment and technical facilities, including laboratory facilities within 30 minutes driving time of the NIEHS, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709.  Established offices and facilities must occur within 60 days of contract award.  Frequent discussions and consultations with NIEHS Project Officer necessitate that the Contractor be in close proximity to minimize the expense to the Government and increase communications.  The anticipated release date of the solicitation is sometime during the 2nd and 3rd week of January 2005.  The NAICS code is 541710.  See Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>BNF, a Records Management and Technology company, is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) on the availability of a DOD STD 5015.2 Certified Electronic Records Management System (ERMS) that will meet National Science Foundation (NSF) requirements. 

Attached you will find NSF’s mandatory requirements in a DOD STD 5015.2 matrix. The mandatory NSF ERMS requirements are listed in Column B.  This information on the matrix is to be applied to judge whether your system meets the two sets of requirements, in addition to the following selection criteria.  NSF and BNF will select those prospects that best meet these requirements and will conduct evaluation and demonstration tests, part of which will be to assess the possible interface with legacy systems—the requirements of which are noted in Column C of the matrix. 

Specific selection criteria will include your past experiences/contracts with Federal agencies whose missions are to support and/or manage:

-Basic and exploratory research in a full spectrum of science and engineering disciplines;
-Basic science and engineering research reports, associated legal and financial records, and regulatory records concerning environmental and animal/human subjects; and
-Administrative records as agreements, licensing, certification, grants and contracts.

If you wish to respond, please list the requirements (by 5015.2 section number) from Column B you know your ERMS can meet, list the requirements your ERMS can probably meet, list the requirements you need further information on, and the requirements your system cannot accommodate.  Email your RFI response to lfriedman@bnfco.com  with a cc copy to bbates@nsf.gov by March 11, 2005.

<CONTACT>Pedro A. Lucero Park Manager 7079662111106  plucero@mp.usbr.gov;
<DESC>TO:	All Individuals or Business Parties with Possible Interest in Future Concession Opportunities at Lake Berryessa, California RE:	Your Analysis of Business Opportunity and Financial Feasibility of Proposed New Public Facilities The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) is requesting statements of interest and opinions regarding the financial opportunities and feasibility for visitor services at Lake Berryessa (CA) from individuals and companies with management experience in the 'Recreation Hospitality Industry'. Lake Berryessa (reservoir) lies among the slopes of the California Coast Range.  It is only a 1 ?- hour drive from Sacramento and approximately a 1 ? - 2 1/2  hour drive from the San Francisco Bay metropolitan area, and less than 1-hour from Napa Valley.  Between 8 and 10 million people reside within these areas.  Lake Berryessa is a fairly large lake, (160 miles of shoreline and 19,250 surface acres of water at gross pool), located in an attractive rural setting.  There are no communities or private property immediately adjacent to the lakeshore.  The lake is extremely popular for all types of boating and water activities. There are presently seven individual business locations and operators (concessionaires) at Lake Berryessa providing a range of visitor services and facilities to the recreating public.  Each of these concessionaires has a concession agreement (contract) with Reclamation.  These contracts were originally authorized in 1958 and 1959 and will all expire by limitation of time in either 2008 or 2009 consistent with Public Law 96-375.  Reclamation has no legal authority to extend or renew existing contracts.  There is no right of preference.  If interested, current concessionaries must compete for any future contracts along with other interested parties.   During the past four years Reclamation has been conducting an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and an associated Visitor Services Plan (VSP) in preparation of the upcoming concession contract expirations and to identify appropriate continuing or changing public services and facilities for the future of Lake Berryessa.  The Draft EIS (DEIS) and other information related to the VSP are available on the Mid-Pacific Region website at:  http://www.usbr.gov/mp/berryessa/index.html. The DEIS is currently open for comment for the period February 16, 2005 - April 4, 2005.  Respondents to this Request for Information are invited to comment on all four alternatives (A through D) in the DEIS.  However, Reclamation is particularly interested in comments by the hospitality industry to Alternative B, Reclamation's current preferred alternative.  Under Alternative B, all long-term trailer use at Lake Berryessa would be eliminated and present concession areas would be dedicated to more traditional short-term recreation facilities and programs.  These include various mixes of the following: marinas (slip rentals, ski & fish boat rentals, marine fuel), campgrounds (tent & RV), houseboat rentals, food & beverage, retail sales (souvenirs, groceries, sundries, camping, fishing, and marina), lodging (cabins, small lodges).   Responses received by April 4, 2005 will be considered by Reclamation in developing the final Record of Decision (ROD).  Alternative B assumes a single concession operator instead of seven individual contracts as is now the case.  Alternative B further assumes a phased re-development process based upon demonstrated financial success of preceding phase(s).  Reclamation recognizes that the term of any future contract must be sufficient  to allow reasonable return on capital investment by a new concessionaire.  A new concessionaire will not be expected to bear the cost of  removal and/or clean-up of existing facilities not required in the next contract term.   Reclamation intends to authorize considerable flexibility for any eventual new concessionaire to develop and submit a comprehensive development plan for Lake Berryessa within a broad framework.  In that regard, respondents should consider Alternative B and the underlying analysis (the Dornbusch Report) as providing general parameters on the types of developments that would be acceptable.  If Alternative B is adoped in the final ROD, Reclamation intends to permit and encourage a new concessionaire - within the general parameters of the plan - to apply their knowledge and expertise in determining the specific numbers and types of individual facilities to be developed in each successive phase of the development process.   Under this Request for Information, Reclamation is not asking for a full Pro Forma type development.  Rather, we are requesting a thoughtful review and assessment by successful and experienced managers in the hospitality industry regarding (1) the commercial viability of the current preferred alternative and; (2) an indication of interest or non-interest on any future contract opportunities should the current preferred alternative be adopted in the final ROD.  This information will be extremely valuable in Reclamation's decision-making process.   This request is not a part of the eventual prospectus/contracting process and the decision to either participate or not will have no bearing on any person or company's opportunity to compete at a later date for a concession contract at Lake Berryessa. In preparing their comments, respondents should thoroughly review key documents available on Reclamation's VSP website, particularly the DEIS, the Dornbusch Report and the Summers and Summers Report which challenges many of Reclamation's basic assumptions.  Reclamation will also sponsor a tour of Lake Berryessa with a detailed briefing to assist interested business parties in gaining first hand information on Lake Berryessa and the preferred alternative.  The tour and  and briefing are scheduled for 9:00 am - 2:00 pm, March 15, 2005 at Reclamation's Lake Berryessa Field Office.   Depending upon the level of interest, Reclamation may also establish additional tour date(s).  Reclamation will provide necessary guides for the tour(s) and knowledgeable employees will be availabale to answer questions.   For planning purposes, representatives of the 'hospitality industry' who intend to participate in the tour should notify Reclamation by March 7, 2005.  Point of contact for the tour is Mr Pete Lucero, Resource Manager, Lake Berryessa.  Mr. Lucero may be reached by telephone at (707) 966-2111, ext 106 or e-mail at  PLUCERO@mp.usbr.gov   All comments and observations must be submitted by April  4, 2005 as part of the DEIS public comment period.  Comments should be in the form of a letter that (1) briefly outlines the applicable professional background and experience of the individual or company, (2) provides professional observations and assessment of the commercial viability of a concession operation described in the preferred alternative, and (3) comments on any other alternative in the DEIS or any other specific aspect of the Lake Berryessa VSP.  Responses should clearly state the firm's name, address, telephone  and fax number, and email address.  Comments should be submitted by regular mail or electronically to: 	Bureau of Reclamation 	Attn: Janet Sierzputowski (jsierzputowski@mp.usbr.gov) 	2800 Cottage Way 	Sacramento, California 95825 	Phone:916-978-5112 fax:916-978-5114 No claim to the Government will be considered for the use of any information submitted.  Intersted parties responding to this notice shall bear all risk and expense of any resources used to provide the information.  The information collected will be considered market research and DEIS comments and will not be returned. Reclamation looks forward to your interest and participation in providing valuable information for consideration this important decision.  While also providing you and/or your company an opportunity for information gathering  and observation that may assist your future interest and involvement in the eventual concession contracting process.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) is seeking potential sources 
in search of a systems integrator for a Headborne System (HBS).  The systems integrator shall possess both developmental and production capabilities for the HBS.  The HBS will be based on using current Marine Corps equipment or will be based on new innovative technologies.  At a minimum, the HBS shall integrate various headborne components (e.g., eyewear, lower face protection, hearing protection, hands free light and communications compatibility) that are compatible with the Lightweight Helmet shell.   In the development of the HBS, firms may acquire new technological capabilities that exceed those of current equipment.  In this event, it is desired that firms develop a prototype that demonstrates these advanced technologies.  It is envisioned that the HBS will be a modular system that enables the individual Marine to configure modular components to meet specific mission requirements.  For example, an infantry Marine may configure the HBS for a night raid that includes a night vision capability while a Marine operating in daytime convoy operations may configure the HBS for other capabilities.  All systems shall optimize the HBS balancing human factors (e.g. comfort and usability), protection (from enemy threats and the environment) and cost (production and maintenance).  The systems integrator will have approximately six months to compete the HBS design and produce prototypes.

The HBS shall offer an integrated configuration that with the following capabilities:
protection, communication, sensory enhancement, camouflage, food & fluid delivery, and weapons interface.

The HBS and all integrated components shall be considered acceptable to Marines.  Acceptable is defined as 80 % of Marines, normally distributed from the 5th through 95th percentile, giving a rating of 4 or better on a seven point scale.  The system must be quickly scalable for threat level using a modular design.  The HBS shall be lightweight such that the selection criteria (e.g., weight, forces and moments) are rated as acceptable by Marines and must be approved by the military medical community.  Current research suggests an ideal maximum weight of 5.5 lbs for the HBS.  It is desired to use a universal attachment system to affix the various modular components of the HBS.  This system would enable new components to be added as required and the location of the component to be customized.  The HBS must be able to operate in all terrestrial conditions found between –25oF and 130oF, including submersion in saltwater.

Protection:  The protection level the shall be quickly and easily scalable by individual Marines.  The means of scalability shall not require Marines to carry tools specifically for this capability.

Helmet: The HBS shall include the USMC Light Weight Helmet (LWH) shell.  The shape of the LWH shell is the same as the older standard PASGT shape.  Previously fielded LWH’s shells (sizes XS-XL) will be retro fitted such that they become an integrated component of the HBS.  The HBS shall meet ballistic performance requirements set forth in the LHW performance specifications (Attachment 1) .  The current suspension system or a new suspension system may be used.

Eye Protection:  The HBS will offer at least two levels of eye protection, ‘spectacles’ and ‘goggles’.  Both levels will meet the appropriate section(s) of ANSI z87.1-2003 standard.  In addition the military ballistic standards must be met (goggles: MIL-V43511C 4.5.10, spectacles: MIL-PRF31013 4.4.1.1).  The eye protection should minimize spaces between itself and bordering ballistic protection.

Lower Face Protection (LFP):  The HBS will include a LFP capability.  The LFP shall not unacceptably interfere with any of the other integrated systems.  This will be determined by that acceptability rating by Marines.  The protection level is as yet undefined, however it is expected to be between the protection level provided by the goggles and the LWH.

Hearing Protection:  The HBS shall incorporate an integrated hearing protection with a non-linear noise reduction capability.  There shall be minimal noise reduction below approximately 110 dB.  Additionally, this capability shall provide a linear noise reduction above approximately 110 dB with a peak reduction of 25 dB at 190 dB.  A mode the provides linear noise reduction between 0 and 190 dB is also desired.  The hearing protection should not interfere with communications systems.  The hearing protection system shall acceptably maintain stereoscopic hearing. 

NBC Protection:  The HBS must not interfere with the use of the current M40 Gasmask or the forthcoming Joint Service Protective Gas Mask (JSPGM).  To don the gasmask, the HBS may be doffed and donned in a similar manner to current standard operating procedures.  Removal/reconfiguration of some components is acceptable.  However, the HBS must not increase the time required to don the gasmask.

Other:  The systems integrator may propose addition protection not specifically mentioned.

Communication Systems:
	
Verbal:  The HBS should minimize any interference verbal communications with other Marines equipped with the HBS and other personnel without the HBS.

Non-Verbal:  Non-verbal communication is an important component of communicating posture to civilians in peace keeping and humanitarian operations.  Therefore, the HBS should be configurable to maximize non-verbal communications including facial expression and eye contact.  

Radio:  The HBS shall include a capability to enable communications using the Personal Role Radio (PRR).  It shall maximize the user’s ability to hear communications especially in hard to hear conditions (e.g., while mounted, in convoy operations and when under fire) or when stealth operations are required.  It shall also maximize the user’s ability to transmit voice clearly in conditions of background noise and wind. The integrator is not required to use the current PRR headset.

Sensory Enhancement:  Generally sensory enhancement is considered to increase a Marine’s effectiveness however, excessive sensory enhancement could result in sensory overload.  The desired level of sensory enhancement, unless specified, will be determined during the field user evaluations.

Hearing:  It is desired that the HBS enhances a Marine’s ability to perceive and process sound.  It is also desired for this capability to be adjustable for personal preference and situation.  

Vision:  
Low light: The system must be configurable such that the photopic luminous transmittance (for the light adapted eye) is not less than 89 percent (‘clear lens’).
Sun: The system must be configurable such that the photopic luminous transmittance (for the light adapted eye) is between 18 and 12 percent (‘smoke lens’).
Night: The HBS must have the ability to integrate AN/PVS-14 and AN/PVS-7 Night Vision Goggles (NVGs).  The NVGs must be removable from the HBS.
Corrective Vision:  The HBS must be able to acceptably accommodate a corrective vision device (such as inserts or glasses).  The device should be capable of holding a CR-39 plastic, -10 to +8 diopters sphere with up to +2.5 diopter of cylinder lens or lenses.
Lights:  The HBS will have the ability to carry a light(s) that can operate in a hand held mode, as well as, be able to operate hands free.  It is desired to be able to project white, red, blue and infrared light.  The light(s) shall be activated using no more than one hand at a time with a positive color selector.  The light must be powered using a power source common to the Marine Corps.
	
Camouflage:  The HBS must not increase the ease of visually detecting the wearer when compared to the current headborne ensemble (i.e. the items currently worn on a Marine’s head).
	
Food and Fluid Delivery:  The HBS in all configurations must enable the Marine to access liquids via the Hydration-on-the-Move system.  The HBS must enable the consumption of solid food without removing the LWH shell.  

Weapons Interface:  The HBS shall not interfere with the Marine’s ability to properly sight current weapon systems.  The HBS must interface acceptably with the following optics, displays and weapons:  TOW missile day sight, M-144 telescope, JAVELIN command launch unit, M-67 mortar sigh, AN/PAS 13 (thermal weapon sight), AN/TVs 5 (monocular image intensifier), M-68 close combat optic, M-24 and M22 binoculars, XM25 stabilized binocular, XM 145 MG optic, M16/A4 and M4 assault rifles.

Statement of Work for
Centralized, Outsourced Mailroom and Imaging Services 
For the Department of Labor, 
Division of Federal Employees’ Compensation


1.	Introduction:  

The Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs (OWCP/DFEC) administers the Federal Employees’ Compensation Act  (FECA).  FECA provides workers’ compensation coverage to three million Federal and Postal workers including wage replacement, medical and vocational rehabilitation benefits for work-related injury and occupational disease.  Compensation claims filed under the Federal Employee Compensation Act are processed by the Division of Federal Employees’ Compensation (DFEC) program.  

The process of adjudicating and managing these compensation claims requires Claims Examiners within DFEC District Offices to review a variety of documents that must be maintained as part of the case processing record of each claim.  These documents provide the supporting evidence of determinations regarding the admissibility of treatments, the amount of compensation to be granted, and other decisions related to the claim.  These case files, which can range in size from fewer than 20 pages to well over 1000, pose a significant paperwork management challenge for DFEC.

1.1	Purpose:

The purpose of the DFEC Mailroom and Imaging Outsourcing program is to establish a centralized mailroom and imaging capability that will achieve the following DFEC technical, management, cost, and risk mitigation objectives:

&#61692;	Improved mailroom, imaging, and data entry throughput and efficiency
&#61692;	Reduced mailroom, imaging, and data entry costs
&#61692;	Common workflow methodologies and process controls 
&#61692;	Established management and technical expertise
&#61692;	Common processing platform
&#61692;	Robust facility and equipment capacities in support of current and future requirements
&#61692;	Ready availability of back-up facilities, equipment and personnel
&#61692;	Established telecommunications capabilities
&#61692;	Implementation of uniform, established quality control procedure

2.	Requirements

The Contractor shall provide mailroom, scanning, and indexing services for Workers Compensation claim documents in accordance with the requirements stated herein.   

2.1	Tracking System

The Contractor shall maintain an automated system for inventory tracking and reporting of all program activities, as described in the following sections.  At a minimum, this system shall provide the following standard reports which shall be made available to OWCP/DFEC via secure Internet communications:

•	Real-time batch status
•	Backlog/Reconciliation Report
•	Turnaround Report – Snapshot of batch status
•	Quality Report
•	Reject Report

These reports shall reflect real-time statistics relating to production and turnaround service levels.  Additionally, as an option, the Contractor shall provide customized ad hoc reports reflecting unique reporting requirements and make these available to DOL on-line.   The reports should also be available in summary and detail formats, and where possible be made available in a downloadable/importable format. 

2.2	Facility

Mailroom services shall be performed at the Contractor’s facility.  The Contractor shall provide a modern state of the art facility. The Contractor shall maintain at least two geographically distinct facilities capable of supporting the capacity requirements stated in Section 3.1 Below.  These facilities must possess similar imaging and processing equipment in order to support OWCP/DFEC/DFEC in the event of a disaster.

2.3	Mail/Document Processing

Contractor shall process all DFEC mail and transmit data to DOL/DFEC within 48 hours from receiving the mail into the facility. Exceptions listed in section 2.4 Out Sorting.

2.3.1	Receiving

The Contractor shall receive incoming mail via third party courier and USPS at this location and prepare for processing.  Contractor shall establish USPS PO BOX.  Incoming mail will be labeled with appropriate district office identification.
  
Mail in shipping bags shall be received at the Contractor’s shipping dock. Trays of envelopes and packages will be extracted from the shipping bags. Identifying information shall be collected for the tray and used for inventory control and tracking purposes.  Each tray will be entered into the Tracking System, which shall produce real time reports that will be available to authorized OWCP/DFEC personnel via a secure Internet Web site.

Mailroom personnel will process the postal trays and provide an envelope volume count for each tray which will be entered into the Tracking System with the appropriate tray identifying information and employee identifying information.

Contractor shall only process envelopes from returned mail. 

2.3.2	Document Preparation

Document separator sheets will be placed between each multi-paged document.  The Separator sheet bar code will be read by the scanner and will indicate the beginning of a new document for sequencing purposes.  

2.3.3	Sorting

The sorting process will commence with the removal of envelopes from the postal trays, extraction of the contents of each envelope, and entry of the employee and mail data into the Tracking System.    If a Case numbers is not present on the document, the Contractor Shall look up the appropriate case number and annotate it on the document, for later index entry.  OWCP/DFEC will provide an extract of their database, with daily updates, for Contractor use in looking up case numbers.  Two percent of the routine mail is anticipated to require case number lookup.  The documents and associated attachments will be prepared for imaging by removing staples, paper clips, repairing torn pages and performing other necessary document preparation functions.

Contractor shall sort mail by document type and District Office.

Sorted tray data shall be entered into the Tracking System to allow the production of real-time Internet reports detailing the total number of sorted trays, by document type.

Documents shall be sorted into the following categories:

Decisions	Nurse 
Fiscal 	Rehab 
Forms	Non-Scannables 
Incoming Correspondence 	
Medical & SOAF

Contractor should be able to accept documents from other electronic sources including faxes and imaged files from Central Bill Contractor.

The scanner operators shall, at a minimum clean the scanner optics and paper transport at the beginning of each shift, as well as, at periodic intervals during each shift in order to maintain optimum image quality. At the beginning of each shift, scanner operators shall run the appropriate test target to verify image quality. The scanner will be calibrated at the beginning of each shift based on the results of the test target.  

The document imaging operators will feed the stack header sheets and associated documents within the stack through the scanners.  Scanners shall operate in duplex scanning mode with the threshold set to automate the deletion of blank pages.  As the documents are scanned, hard copy documents and images will be assigned a unique Document Control Number (DCN) as part of the index during the scanning process.  The DCN will be in a format acceptable to OWCP/DFEC and will be imprinted on the document pre-scan along with the case number.  Multi-page documents will contain the same DCN.  

As the documents are scanned, the corresponding images shall be electronically batched and transmitted to the production location for indexing. The Tracking System will be continuously updated with the location of each image. 

Upon completion of the document imaging process, the Tracking System shall produce real-time internet reports detailing the total number of documents scanned, by type, and by District Office.  The scanner operator shall delete batches that are not processed properly during capture.  An operator shall rescan these batches. 

The Contractor shall verify that the numbers of paper pages match the scanned pages.  Quality control personnel shall verify that images have been scanned correctly, blank pages have been dropped, and the image is viewable.  Poor quality source documents will be rescanned to improve quality and if quality does not improve pass a message in the description field indicating best scan possible.  These documents will be identified by DCN on the reject report.

2.4	Out Sorting

The following documents including all attachments shall labeled with receipt date and forwarded daily to the appropriate District Office Via overnight delivery service without further processing: 

Congressional Inquiries and forms CA1, CA2, CA2a, CA5, CA6, CA7, CA7a, CA7b, CA16.  

The Contractor shall perform case number look up to determine the appropriate district office.  If the case number is unavailable, the district office will be determined by the geographic location of the claimant’s address.

Medical Bills shall be out sorted to the appropriate Contractor office via overnight delivery without further processing.

The Contractor shall annotate the medical bills with the case number, remove the attachments, and label them with receipt date and forward daily to the appropriate Contractor via overnight delivery without further processing.  The Contractor shall perform case number look up to determine the appropriate district office.  If the case number is unavailable, the district office will be determined by the geographic location of the claimant’s address.  Attachments removed from the medical bills will have the case number annotated and sorted into the appropriate category for processing.

2.5	Quality Control (QC)

The Contractor shall provide random QC on at least 2% of all prepped batches.  Quality control personnel shall, at a minimum, verify that annotated case numbers are correct, the documents are in the correct category, that documents have been correctly separated between each document, that all fasteners have been removed, pages have been repaired as necessary, and the appropriate header sheet is on the batch.  When QC is complete, the batches will be returned for pick-up by the scan operator.   QC shall include a random check of envelopes to ensure that all mail has been extracted from envelopes. Results of the QC/QA check shall be documented in the appropriate report.
	
2.6	Indexing/Data Capture

All indexing shall be performed using Contractor systems, software and personnel and will result in the creation of an electronic data file formatted per OWCP/DFEC specifications.

			Attn:  Ed Tennant
	
2.	 Background
	The United States National Weather Service (NWS) in cooperation with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has implemented a satellite communications system that provides time sensitive, aviation and meteorological data to users in the Atlantic Ocean Region and the Pacific Ocean Region. This satellite communications system is called the International Satellite Communications System (ISCS) and is composed of two segments: 1) The International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) World Area Forecast System (WAFS), and 2) The World Meteorological Organization’s (WMO) Regional Meteorological Telecommunication Network (RMTN).
	
	3. System Overview
	The current ISCS network provides precision meteorological coverage in much of WMO Regions 2-5, and consists of approximately 82 geographically dispersed sites in 60 countries.
	
		3.1	World Area Forecast System (WAFS)
	The World Area Forecast System (WAFS) Satellite Broadcast System is a C-band global satellite broadcast system via ISCS for the one-way transmission and timely dissemination of critical aviation weather data and forecast products in support of International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) operations. The broadcast is provided via the Intelsat satellite located at 325.5 degrees east for users in the Atlantic Ocean Region (AOR), and via the Intelsat satellite at 177 degrees east for users in the Pacific Ocean Region (POR). 
	
		3.2	Regional Meteorological Telecommunications Network (RMTN)
	The RMTN is a joint program effort between the NWS and nations in Central America and the Caribbean. The RMTN provides a reliable C-band satellite two-way communications system for the exchange and the distribution of meteorological information between the meteorological service organizations of all the countries that are part of the network. The NWS operates the RMTN through joint funding with the other nations.  
	
		3.3	VSAT Equipment
	The ISCS was implemented based on C-band Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) technology, which allows satellite to ground telecommunications. Users of the system receive ISCS products directly via the VSATs. The individual user sites own the VSAT equipment.
		
		3.4	ISCS Workstation Terminal 
	Connected to the end-user site VSATs is a PC-based workstation terminal, which either utilizes a a Linux or MS Windows operating system. The ISCS workstation terminal permits ISCS end-users to take the received data and display it in several different text, graphic and image formats for developing weather forecast charts, aviation flight planning, and composing and transmitting meteorological products.  The ISCS workstation terminal serves as a critical communications link to the WMO Global Telecommunications System (GTS). The ISCS workstation is not a part of this RFI.
	
		3.5	Technical Description
	The WAFS portion of the ISCS has two World Area Forecast Centers (WAFCs) that serve as the source of data transmitted on the system.  The WAFCs are located in Silver Spring, Maryland and Exeter, United Kingdom. The United States portion of WAFS is driven from the NWS Telecommunications Gateway (NWSTG) in Silver Spring, Maryland via the NWS ISCS broadcast system which receives funding support from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The Exeter WAFC provides backup to the Silver Spring WAFSC, in the event of a loss of the ISCS Master Ground Station.
	
	The NWS provides coverage to the Atlantic Ocean and Pacific Ocean Regions by uplinking data to INTELSAT managed satellites. The interface point between the Contractor provided ISCS system and NWS facilities will continue to be at the NWSTG, which will be the source of WAFS data to be transmitted on the Contractor provided ISCS.
	
	The United Kingdom (U.K.) provides coverage via the Satellite Distribution System (SADIS) for WAFS products to the Indian Ocean Region via the INTELSAT located at 60 degrees east.  SADIS is not a part of the ISCS and is not a part of this RFI.
	
 

4.	General Requirements
	The Contractor must plan to operate and maintain the replacement ISCS in accordance with the functional and performance requirements contained in this RFI. All Contractor provided equipment must conform to accepted commercial engineering standards, and must be suitable for continuous operation with corrective and preventive maintenance periods conforming to the specification. All Contractor provided software must be commercially available off the shelf (COTS). The Government understands that it may be necessary for an Contractor to use specially developed software.  If a Contractor must develop software specifically to meet the requirements stated in this RFI, all specially developed software would become the property of the Government.  If the Contractor opts to utilize an IP multicast as the means of broadcasting ISCS data, they must provide the multicast application platform. Due to the international provisos of the ISCS, change or modification to the configuration, such as addition, deletion, or relocation of a user site is to be considered likely. The Contractor must support the requirement for continued configuration flexibility of the replacement network. The following capabilities are therefore required:
	
&#61585;	The Contractor must provide disconnection and removal of Contractor provided user site equipment within 30 calendar days after notification.
&#61585;	The Contractor must provide installation and operational cutover of Contractor provided user site equipment within 30 calendar days after notification, providing the required permits and/or licenses have already been obtained.
&#61585;	The Contractor must provide relocation of Contractor provided equipment and restorations of Contractor provided service to the user site(s) within 30 calendar days after notification.
	
	The Contractor will provide maintenance and technical support (hardware, software, operational) for all ISCS components (satellite communications facilities, VSAT equipment, and interface hardware/software) located at NWS ISCS sites. In addition to these general requirements, the Contractor must meet training, documentation, and implementation requirements as stated herein.
	
	
 
5.	ISCS Implementation Phases
	The replacement ISCS must be a totally independent system. Thus, although it will interface with the existing WAFS and RMTN, an effort must be made not to use any existing space segment facilities.  The implementation must be in two phases. Phase one will be replacement of the RMTN space segment and associated data links, and phase two will be replacement of the WAFS space segment and associated data links. 
	
	
6.	System Capabilities
	
		A. Communications Channels
	The existing ISCS operates at the CCITT TCP/IP data rate (64 Kbps) which supports nine (9) IP sockets for ISCS data as follows:
		Socket 1 – AOR/WAFS1 – GRIB 
		Socket 2 – AOR/WAFS2 - TEXT
		Socket 3 – AOR/WAFS3 – FAX/BUFR*
		Socket 4 - RMTN1 – GRIB
		Socket 5 – RMTN2 - TEXT and Loop around of ISCS RMTN portion
		Socket 6 – RMTN3 – FAX/BUFR* and Satellite Imagery
		Socket 7 – POR/WAFS1 – GRIB 
		Socket 8 – POR/WAFS2 - TEXT
		Socket 9 – POR/WAFS3 – FAX/BUFR*
	
	The Contractor provided replacement ISCS must operate at the current 64 Kbps data rate at minimum and use standard TCP/IP protocol. Because of the speed, the physical connection can be with 10/100Base-T between the Contractor supplied interface equipment and the NWSTG hardware. The NWSTG will provide space for the Contractor interface equipment at the NWSTG facility located at 1325 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, Maryland.
		
		B. Data Types
		The three types of data transmitted over the RMTN are further described as follows:
 

&#61585;	Global Gridded Binary (GRIB) Data: Flight planning, wind and temperature data, and meteorological data used for preparing significant weather charts for the required altitudes and valid times.
&#61585;	Facsimile (FAX) Graphics: Significant weather and specified wind and temperature charts prepared at the Washington World Meteorological Center.
&#61585;	Satellite Imagery: Real time weather satellite images from NOAA's Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES). 
&#61585;	Alphanumeric (Text) Operational Meteorological Data: Plain language, abbreviated plain language, coded information, and international Notices.
&#61585;	*Binary Universal Form for the Representation of Meteorological Data (BUFR) will replace FAX graphics by mid 2005.
	
		C. Equipment
	The VSAT equipment used by ISCS/WAFS receive-only user consists of a 2.4 m diameter antenna with RF electronics and a Comtech satellite receiver modem. RMTN two-way users utilize a Hughes PES-8000 that has transmit capability and utilizes a TCP/IP interface card.  The ISCS workstation utilizes a 10Base-T interface card to connect to the VSAT interface (either Comtech modem or Turbo card).  The sites own all site equipment. 
	
		D. Network Sizing
	The replacement ISCS must support the existing number of user sites (30 two-way in AOR, 25 receive-only in AOR, and 27 receive-only in POR) at minimum with capabilities for future expansion.  The replacement system must have the flexibility to efficiently allocate resources to accommodate various types of traffic simultaneously and, as necessary, on a dynamically changing basis. Means must be provided for monitoring of the complete system at the NWSTG in Silver Spring, Maryland. 
	
		E. System Monitoring
	The Contractor shall be responsible for providing continuous monitoring of the link between the NWSTG and Contractor’s uplink hub facilities, detecting and recording any network failure, and notifying the NWS. The NWS monitors the AOR using a VSAT at the NWSTG, and the POR using a backhaul circuit from a VSAT located in Honolulu, Hawaii.
		
	The NWSTG monitors the RMTN and WAFS broadcasts 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Special software (not provided by the Contractor) at the NWSTG monitors and displays the status of all operational two-way sites. Should network anomalies occur; the Contractor will work with the site on fault isolation/correction to restore full operations expeditiously. 
		
		F. Reliability, Maintainability, and Availability (RMA)
	The vital nature of the weather data furnished by the ISCS makes consideration of RMA essential. The Contractor must design the replacement ISCS in such a way to minimize the detrimental effect of individual network component failures.
		
		The Contractor’s system must either meet or exceed the following:
		OA 	= MTBF/(MTBF + MDT)
		Where:		MTBF = Mean Time Between Failures
		MDT	= Mean Down Time
		OA 	= Operational Availability
 

&#61500;	Network OA (NOA) is the availability of the network (i.e., all components of the Contractor’s system that are linked to all user sites and the NWSTG. A network failure would result in a loss of service to all user sites and the NWSTG. 
	
&#61500;	Network MDT is the mean time required to restore the network to operational status after a failure. The downtime begins at the instant of failure and ends when service is restored (including the time for all travel, administrative delay, logistic delay, fault isolation, and active repair).
	
&#61500;	Redundant Data Link Availability (RDLA) is the availability of the redundant data link between the NWSTG and the Contractor’s satellite communications network.
		
&#61500;	Site Operational Availability (SOA) is the availability of any site in the network. 
	
&#61500;	Site Mean Downtime (SMDT) is incurred during Contractor efforts to restore the site(s) to operation after equipment failure.  The time starts with notification to the Contractor of a failure and ends when service is restored at the site(s). The time includes all travel, administrative delay, logistic delay, fault isolation, and active repair. 
		NOA	 =  .997 over each 24-hour period       =  .999 over each month
		RDLA	 =  .997 over each 24-hour period       =  .999 over each month
		SOA	 =  .99 over each month	(< 7 hours 18 minutes downtime per month)	
		SMDT  =  24 hours for Continental United States sites, 48 hours for all others.
		
	
		The following conditions may not be used in calculating availability of the network:
 

&#61585;	Downtime required for scheduled preventive maintenance
&#61585;	Downtime required for system upgrades
&#61585;	Downtime due to Government furnished equipment (GFE) failures
&#61585;	Downtime due to power outages at Government facilities
&#61585;	Downtime due to solar outages due to satellite/Sun eclipse (Sun outages)
		
		Site Failures are defined as follows:
&#61585;	A receive only (RO) site is unable to receive data  of acceptable quality due to failures in the Contractor provided service, site equipment, software, or procedure
&#61585;	A transmit-receive (2-Way) site is unable to receive/disseminate or transmit/broadcast data of acceptable quality due to failures in Contractor provided service, site equipment, software, or procedure

Space Segment Failures are defined as follows:
&#61585;	NWSTG is unable to broadcast or receive data due to failure of the Contractor provided Master Ground Station
&#61585;	Contractor provided master Ground Station is unable to uplink data due to failure of the Contractor provided satellite service
	
	The outage time for computing System Availability (SA) is defined as the period from the time the Contractor is notified of the maintenance problem, to the time when the system is available for use. 
	
	The Contractor must provide a replacement ISCS meeting the following minimum RMA requirements:
 

&#61500;	The system must be designed to minimize total system failures caused by a single site or component failure.
			
&#61500;	The system must be designed such that the interruption of service to one user site will not impair the service provided to any other user site.
	
&#61500;	The Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) for outages must be as follows:
 

1.	Equipment at the NWSTG			= 6 hours
2.	Other NWS sites (Hawaii, San Juan, Miami)       = 12 hours
3.	Any other locations				=  48 hours
4.	Loss of Satellite / Space Segment		= 6 hours
		
 
&#61500;	The availability of the network must be at least .997 over each base time period of 24 hours and at least .999 over each month.
	 	
	
	7.	Warranty and Maintenance
	Services required to maintain the ISCS network at a 99.7 percent operational availability must include a 7x24x365 Call Center for problem/trouble reporting and response, and preventive and corrective electronic maintenance for very small aperture terminal (VSAT) equipment, consisting of transmitters, receivers, administrative work stations, antennas, couplers, masts/towers, and in some cases deicing equipment. The NWS has anticipated that some maintenance may be fixed price and other work may be done on a time and material or cost reimbursement basis.  The NWS envisions the future Contractor(s) having an international network of technicians dispersed in selected localities that could respond to an outage within a few hours as dispatched from its central Toll-free Call Center.  Potential Contractor’s should have experience with maintenance and repair of similar equipment as will be required in any potential future solicitation.
	
	
 
8.  Documentation
	The Documentation for the replacement ISCS system shall include a Network Manual and a User Manual as described below:
			
 
&#61585;	The Contractor must develop and deliver a comprehensive Network Manual to be used by NWSTG staff. The Network Manual must include an overview of the system as a whole plus provide information and detailed procedures sufficient to guide the operation, and monitoring of the network by NWSTG personnel.

10.	Summary and Conclusion
	The National Weather Service (NWS) is seeking interested sources to provide satellite communications facilities, maintenance, and technical support services necessary to continue operations and maintenance of the International Satellite Communications System (ISCS).  The ISCS is a satellite based communications system that encompasses two major data services that address requirements established by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and World Meteorological Organization (WMO).  The two data services are the World Area Forecast System (WAFS) Satellite Broadcast System, and the Regional Meteorological Telecommunications Network (RMTN).  NWS implemented the ISCS in 1995, and it is fully operational.
	
	The replacement ISCS must be a totally independent system. Thus, although it will interface with the existing WAFS and RMTN, an effort must be made not to use any existing space segment facilities.  The implementation must be in two phases. Phase one will be replacement of the WAFS space segment and associated data links, and phase two will be replacement of the RMTN space segment and associated data links.	
	
	The Contractor provided replacement ISCS must operate at the current 64 Kbps data rate at minimum, and use standard TCP/IP protocol. If the Contractor opts to utilize an IP multicast as the means of broadcasting ISCS data, they must provide the multicast application platform.  In addition, the Contractor must meet training, documentation, and implementation requirements as stated herein. The Contractor must operate and maintain the replacement ISCS system in accordance with the requirements of this RFI and the functional and performance requirements as specified herein. The Contractor must provide onsite maintenance and repair service dispatch capability as well as a 7x24x365 Call Center for problem/trouble reporting and response, for all countries utilizing the ISCS.
	
	
	No solicitation for this requirement exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation.  Information pertinent to the submission of responses to this RFI is set forth above in the first section of this RFI.  Questions concerning this RFI should be directed to Ed Tennant, telephone (301) 713-0828 extension 117.

<RESPDATE>032805
<CONTACT>Point of Contact - Mark D Lopez, Contract Specialist,  619-524-7168
<DESC>1.0  Description 1.1   The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR), in support of PEO C4I & Space, Shore Integration Program Office (PMW 790), seeks information on how an interested Contractor or Contractors could act as a lead system integrator or integrators (LSI) to align the existing shore communications support structure with all emerging Fleet requirements.  This RFI requests information on the best method to transform the Navyâ€™s current, partially serial data and partially internet protocol (IP) shore network to an All-IP architecture.  We are soliciting responses from all interested parties. 1.2   THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes â€“ it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.  This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Respondees are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested partyâ€™s expense.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website and the SPAWAR E-Commerce Central website at https://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil.  It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement. 2.0   Background The Fleet requires upgraded shore communications capabilities to migrate the existing shore communications requirements into a coherent, scalable, network-centric architecture.  The new infrastructure must support remaining legacy architectures along with the ability to support next generation joint, net-centric, interoperable capabilities.  The enterprise management system will provide a network monitoring and management capability for the entire Navy shore infrastructure.  The new architecture will consist of two regional Network Operations Security Center  (RNOSCs) that will monitor and control the Navy network. Although each RNOSC will be responsible for a specific Area of Responsibility (AOR), either RNOSC will be able to assume the load of both AORs.  The RNOSCs will provide situational awareness to the global NOSC (GNOSC) as well as to the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) via the Global Information Grid (GIG).  Attachment 1 illustrates a high-level, notional representation of the RNOSC with pertinent interfaces. The Government desires a LSI approach to provide a total enterprise management solution with the following net-centric enablers:  NOSC consolidation, IPv6 migration, end-to-end Quality of Service (QoS), and integrated Information Assurance (IA)/security.  The LSI will need to integrate with ongoing efforts initiated by the government as well as create a sound engineering strategy to provide for a total Enterprise Management solution.  Initiatives currently being addressed include serial circuit elimination, IP messaging implementation, and enterprise network management.  Accompanying attachment 2 delineates current Navy shore planning for development and implementation in the coming years.  It also denotes what the government plans to accomplish, the migration that the LSI is expected to continue and build upon, and the key efforts that the LSI is expected to design and implement. 2.1   Planned Development:  Initial tasks commencing FY06. 2.2   Planned Production:  Initial tasks commencing FY06. 2.3   Delivery Period:  Initial tasks commencing FY07. 2.4   Limitations:  Interoperability between other agencies (e.g. DISA, AF, Army, USCM, etc.) and interfacing with legacy Navy infrastructure. 2.5   Security Requirements:  SECRET 3.0   Requested Information The Government envisions a LSI approach but the details of that structure have not yet been defined.

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate (AFRL/MN), Eglin AFB, FL, intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order for infrared camera repair to one of the following vendors: Mission Research Corporation, 735 State Street, Santa Barbara, CA 93102 or SSG Precision Optronics, Inc., 65 Jonspin Road, Wilmington, MA 01887.  The camera's original optical housing paint is peeling and requires removal, surface preparation and painting.  BACKGROUND:  The existing CIRS operates inside the cryogenic vacuum test chamber (KVACC) located in the Kinetic Kill Vehicle Hardware-in-the-Loop Simulator (KHILS) facility.  The KHILS facility provides a realistic ground-test environment for quantifying the performance of precision-guided interceptors for strategic and theater missile defense.  The objective of the existing KVACC system is to provide a complete cryogenic optical system, a complex infrared target projection system, and a surrogate sensor subsystem that meets the required optical, radiometric, and environmental conditions for hardware-in-the-loop testing of Kinetic Kill Vehicles (KKV's) requiring exo-atmospheric temperature and altitude conditions.  The CIRS provides the surrogate sensor system and provides characterization of the emitter technologies.  CIRS is an all- reflective optical system with independent cooling circuits for the optics and the FPA.  The camera is surrounded with cold shielding and thermally insulated from the KVACC chamber to eliminate stray radiation.  The optics are cooled to 77 K and the focal plane array is cooled to 45 K.  CIRS uses an SE-IR CamIRa tm for operating the FPA electronics. The camera head is mounted on the outside of the KVACC sensor chamber.  SCOPE OF WORK:  The purpose of this contractual effort is to capture ambient interferometer performance data prior to disassembly and repair.  Remove the mirrors, which are pinned to a common housing allowing easy removal and replacement.  Realignment may be required.  Then clean the optical housing, prepare for painting, paint, and cure the paint.  Then prepare the housing for reassembly and operation in a cryovacuum environment.  Reassemble the mirrors to the housing.  Obtain ambient interferometer performance data and align the mirrors to achieve performance equal to or better than the performance data collected at the beginning of the repair process if required.  As a separately priced option, cryogenic interferometer performance data collection at the completion and prior to shipping to KHILS shall be included in the quote.  APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS:  Technical papers that may be reviewed to provide additional background information are:  Mechanical Drawings, Acceptance Test Data, and Design Review Presentations.  GOVERNMENT FURNISHED EQUIPMENT:  The following list of equipment shall be provided:  CIRS camera with the FPA, FPA clamp, filters and focus stage removed. (Housing and mirrors only); FPA retro ball fixture for interferometer testing.  TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:  This program shall include the interferometer performance characterization, mirror removal and refurbishment of the CIRS housing, reassembly, alignment, and post interferometer performance data:  Acceptance Test Interferometer Data (prior to disassembly measure ambient baseline wave front error (WFE) at HeNe laser wavelength (could require a government decision if WFE exceeds 0.45 at this point based on current performance of WFE < 0.45)), Pre-refurbishment characterization, Refurbishment (remove old paint, surface preparation, paint using flat black Aeroglaze Z306), Assembly, post interferometer data and alignment (measure ambient WFE at HeNe laser wavelength (WFE <0.45), priced option:  measure cryogenic WFE at HeNe laser wavelength (WFE < 0.54).  ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS:  Contractors must also provide with their quotations the following:  Technical:  (1) procedures for surface preparation, application, and bake out of Z306 flat black paint on aluminum surfaces and, (2) procedures for verifying optical alignment of CIRS collimating optics after repainting and reassembly.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number GDQ051020 is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-27. This is a total small business set-aside under NAICS 238910 with an associated small business size standard of $12M.  Make sure that FAC# is latest.  Note your NAICS and size standard.  Requirement- Crawler Dozer with a minimum of 140 DBHP, a minimum blade width of 10 feet, and rollover protection.  The services covered in this contract include the furnishing of operator, equipment, transportation, fuel, lubricants and incidentals.  The contractor shall ensure that the operator is thoroughly familiar with the operation of the required equipment and the work to be completed under this contract.  Work to be Completed-  Maintenance/reconstruction of earthen reservoirs and the construction of two new reservoirs. Trees and shrubs should be cleared from the dam site and flooded basin and placed downstream from the site or above the high water line. The foundation area of the dam should be plowed (18 inches deep) and scarified in the direction of the main axis of the dam so there will be a good bond between the foundation and the fill material. The minimum bottom width of the trench must be 12 feet with a 1 to 1 side slope. Where suitable material is available above the dam, it should be obtained there so the borrow pit will become part of the reservoir and add depth to the impoundment. During the compaction phase of construction all of the fill dimensions should be increased by 10 percent to allow for settling of the material over time.  1. The slopes of the dam must be a minimum of 3 to 1 on the upstream side, 2 to 1 on the downstream side, and 4 to 1 on the rest of the slopes of the impoundment.  2. Minimum width at the top of the dam must be 12 feet.  3. Freeboard (depth from the top of the dam to the high water  mark when the spillway is carrying the estimated peak runoff)  must not be less than 3 feet. The spillway must be designed to minimize the risk of the dam being overtopped during the design life of the structure. A natural spillway is preferred. It should have a broad, relatively flat cross section, be located away from the fill, and re-enter the main channel some distance downstream from the fill. When a spillway is built, it should be wide and flat bottomed. The entrance must be wide and smooth and the grade of the spillway channel mild so the water will flow through without cutting. The spillway should be no less than 25 feet wide to provide for snow and trash 	blockage.  4. The emergency spillway will be designed to safely pass the peak runoff from a 25 year storm. You should include some allowance for sedimentation.  5. Minimum depth at the lowest corner of the pit will be 10 feet unless subsurface rock or other conditions prevent this depth.  6. Semicompaction is required as a minimum. Semicompaction means that compaction is obtained by placing the embankment material by scraper type equipment in approximately horizontal layers, 6 inches thick, and distributing the equipment travel over the entire width of the embankment to obtain uniform compaction while placing the material. The material must contain sufficient moisture for the travel of the equipment to effectively consolidate the embankment.  7. Topsoil should be stockpiled during every reservoir construction and spread uniformly over the disturbed areas. Topsoil must not be disturbed above the high water line except for spillway excavations or when the borrow must be taken from other than the impoundment area.  The anticipated performance window will be from April 2005 to May 2005.  Proper conditions and the ability to perform the required work may vary due to air temperature, soil temperature, snow cover, and access to the area.  Location-  Tank locations range from approximately 12 miles northeast of Aztec, NM, to 30 miles southeast of Blanco.  Access to the sites are over public roads, both paved and unimproved dirt.  Measurement and Payment- The number of hours of actual equipment use (Crawler Dozer with operator) will be determined by the Contracting Officer after comparison of records by the Contractor and the Contracting Officer at the end of each day the work is performed. Moving the specified equipment to and from the work-site shall be at the expense of the Contractor.  Moving the equipment from one portion of the work-site to another after equipment rental has been ordered, will be paid for at the Contract price per hour for the particular equipment.  Basis of Payment- Payment will be full compensation for the number of hours of actual equipment used measured to the nearest 1/4 of an hour. No compensation will be made for travel to and from the worksite. The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial applies to this acquisition. By the provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items, technical capability of equipment and labor to meet the described government need, and price will be evaluated equally. It is advised that a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items be submitted along with the offer; the provision may also be completed online by accessing http://orca.bpn.gov. The clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items applies. No addenda are enclosed.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.

I.	 STATEMENT OF WORK

INTRODUCTION

The Office of Democracy and Governance (DCHA/DG) is one of the larger offices of the Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance Bureau (DCHA/DG). DCHA/DG has a staff of 73 including direct hires and others.  It is the successor office of the Center for Democracy and Governance that was created in 1994 to provide technical support and guidance to USAID, especially to field missions. DCHA/DG also has an important directive, as did the old Center, to train and strengthen the Agency’s cadre of democracy officers. The Office is also charged with managing three congressionally mandated funds grouped together under the rubric of Special Programs to Address the Needs of Survivors (SPANS). They are the Leahy War Victims Fund, the Displaced Children's and Orphans' Fund, and the Victims of Torture Fund. The funds address particular needs of individuals in conflict countries.   

The DG Office is structured into 4 technical divisions plus 2 teams:  Rule of Law, Elections and Political Processes; Civil Society; and Governance- a Strategies Division; a Program and Information Team, and a SPANS team.  The Strategies Division coordinates the DG Office’s backstopping of field missions and regional bureaus, and works with these operating units to improve the quality of their democratic governance activities. The Program Division also reviews democracy and governance programs to learn from past experiences with a view to improving the Agency’s know-how in program design and implementation.  The Program and Information Team supports the office’s program function; that is, it manages the office’s budgeting and procurement processes, reporting, and collects certain statistic information about Agency democracy and governance programs.  

As a technical office in a pillar bureau, DCHA/DG has also been given the task of being prepared to respond quickly to the total failure of governance in weak states such as the collapse of the state in Afghanistan and Iraq. In such situations, technical assistance by DCHA/DG for the timely and punctuated interventions is critical. By definition a failed state is one without governance. For this reason the DG Office, plans to hire one U.S. citizen personal services contractor (USPSC) to be available to deploy to provide fast and flexible assistance targeted at the restoration or establishment of democratic governance. The deployment will be to the affected country and can last from several weeks to as long as one year. When not deployed the PSC's will be integrated into the regular DCHA/DG staff and will work under the direction of the division or team leader to which they are assigned by the DG Office Director.

I.  STATEMENT OF WORK

INTRODUCTION

The Office of Democracy and Governance (DCHA/DG) is one of the larger offices of the Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance Bureau (DCHA/DG). DCHA/DG has a staff of 73 including direct hires and others.  It is the successor office of the Center for Democracy and Governance that was created in 1994 to provide technical support and guidance to USAID, especially to field missions. DCHA/DG also has an important directive, as did the old Center, to train and strengthen the Agency¡¦s cadre of democracy officers. The Office is also charged with managing three congressionally mandated funds grouped together under the rubric of Special Programs to Address the Needs of Survivors (SPANS). They are the Leahy War Victims Fund, the Displaced Children's and Orphans' Fund, and the Victims of Torture Fund. The funds address particular needs of individuals in conflict countries.   

The DG Office is structured into 4 technical divisions plus 2 teams:  Rule of Law, Elections and Political Processes; Civil Society; and Governance- a Strategies Division; a Program and Information Team, and a SPANS team.  The Strategies Division coordinates the DG Office¡¦s backstopping of field missions and regional bureaus, and works with these operating units to improve the quality of their democratic governance activities. The Program Division also reviews democracy and governance programs to learn from past experiences with a view to improving the Agency¡¦s know-how in program design and implementation.  The Program and Information Team supports the office¡¦s program function; that is, it manages the office¡¦s budgeting and procurement processes, reporting, and collects certain statistic information about Agency democracy and governance programs.  

As a technical office in a pillar bureau, DCHA/DG has also been given the task of being prepared to respond quickly to the total failure of governance in weak states such as the collapse of the state in Afghanistan and Iraq. In such situations, technical assistance by DCHA/DG for the timely and punctuated interventions is critical. By definition a failed state is one without governance. For this reason the DG Office, plans to hire one U.S. citizen personal services contractor (USPSC) to be available to deploy to provide fast and flexible assistance targeted at the restoration or establishment of democratic governance. The deployment will be to the affected country and can last from several weeks to as long as one year. When not deployed the PSC's will be integrated into the regular DCHA/DG staff and will work under the direction of the division or team leader to which they are assigned by the DG Office Director. 

For more information about DCHA/DG and its activities, please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/democracy_and_governance.
 

POSITION OVERVIEW

The worldwide nature of DG's program requires a Field Advisor who can provide immediate consultation on DG projects. The proper execution of DG programs demands that an individual with managerial and operational skills is available for short-term critical work in Washington and the field, determined on a case by case basis, to perform specific operational and advisory functions.

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

This is a position requiring excellent management skills, a high degree of communications skills and negotiation ability to serve as a liaison between the Office of Democracy and Governance DCHA, USAID Washington, and the USAID Mission, Representative or the US Ambassador (in the absence of a USAID Mission). The incumbent will be sent, on an as needed basis, to a wide range of DG project sites and proposed new country program sites.  In some geographic locations this individual will be called upon to work with officials from other international organizations, bilateral donors, and non-governmental organizations.  The Field Advisor will report to the Deputy Director or his/her designee.

In the capacity of Field Advisor the incumbent will be responsible for the following types of activities abroad where DG country programs are in place: assessing the needs of the DG program, evaluating the work of the grantee, and ensuring the various USG interests are coordinated and policy implemented. The Field Advisor will consult with the Deputy Director, or designee, on a regular basis to develop a clear and coherent basis from which to implement programmatic changes and needs.  Assisting in Washington and/or the field with new country program start-ups, providing operational support in periods of need, review and evaluation of ongoing projects, and country-program closeouts will be of particular importance in the work of the Field Advisor.

The Field Advisor will, as necessary:

ƒÝ	Conduct, with in-country representatives, visits to field sites in areas where DG has projects 

ƒÝ	Fill critical staffing needs in Washington including the provision of support to new country start-ups and on-call technical assistance 

ƒÝ	Assess the status of micro-projects and report on all coordination activities and command structures, including the effectiveness of each site's operations

ƒÝ	Review and monitor the plans and activities of any DG grantee and ensure coordination of grantee programs with USAID mission and other international organizations

ƒÝ	Execute other closeout activities related to DG programs and provide technical assistance to ongoing evaluations of DG programs in the field.

In new country programs, the Field Advisor will as necessary:

ƒÝ	Participate in assessing the feasibility of the country as a potential candidate for an DG program
ƒÝ	Participate in conceptualizing and designing the country program, with project managers of DG and its grantees

ƒÝ	Serve as a liaison with other DCHA offices, other USAID divisions and the State Department to ensure program and policy direction

ƒÝ	Within the guidelines provided by the relevant DG/Washington Team Leader, negotiate program and project agreements with governmental and non-governmental counterparts

ƒÝ	Develop relationships with NGOs, international donors, USG agencies and others interested in the DG country program;

ƒÝ	Assess project sites and participate in selecting contractors and grantees to work under DG's country program;

ƒÝ	In close collaboration with the relevant DG/Washington Team Leader, assist the development of DG strategies and policies for the country
	
ƒÝ	Monitor and evaluate the country program, individual projects, and contractor and grantee performance

ƒÝ	Perform other duties as assigned

WORK ENVIRONMENT
Because of the need for quick response and creativity in complex situations, the Field Advisor is expected to operate with autonomy, responsibility and authority. The sensitive nature of the work demands that the incumbent be an individual with good skills of social interaction and a skilled interpreter of politically charged situations.  Since work may require continued changes in program direction and implementation, including frequent coordination, the individual will be someone who is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change.

6 		Project Description and Profile

USTDA intends to commission a DM to travel to Turkey to investigate renewable energy opportunities for possible USTDA assistance.  The consultant will be expected to travel to Ankara for at least one week to meet with government officials, Turkish project sponsors (private companies), U.S. companies, U.S. Embassy officials and World Bank representatives.  In September 2004, U.S. Secretary of Energy Abraham and Turkish Minister of Energy Guler discussed renewable energy as an area of the potential increased U.S.-Turkish cooperation.  Turkey will have incentives to adopt renewable energy technologies in order to meet European Union energy regulations if it is admitted.

Turkey has a total electricity demand of approximately 150,000 GWh, which is currently being met by lignite fired, natural gas combined cycle plants and large hydropower projects.  However, demand is expected to increase in 2010 to 240,000 GWh and to 350,000 GwH in 2015.  If Turkey is admitted to the EU, its energy needs could increase even more.  In order to meet these growing needs, Turkey is beginning to evaluate alternative sources of energy supply, including increased natural gas development and also environmentally sound renewable technologies, as Turkey has extensive resources for the production of renewable energy.  Renewable energy would allow Turkey to rely less on imported fuel, which would enhance Turkey’s energy security.

Potential renewable energy production capability in Turkey is as follows: 

Wind– 88,000MW
Hydro – 35,000MW
Geothermal – 35,000MW 
Solar – 35 MTOE (million tons of oil equivalent) per year.  

Turkey is in the process of reviewing a draft law on renewable energy that covers wind, solar, geothermal, biomass, and small hydroelectric energy production.  This law will require all retail electricity providers to purchase 8% of their electricity from renewable power sources.

Turkey is also exploring the possibility of exporting electricity to countries that have renewable energy quotas (primarily in Europe), which would bring in additional revenue.
Although Turkey has been pursuing renewable projects for several years, the private sector has only recently shown significant interest in pursuing these opportunities, because of the improved economic situation and the fact that financing is now available.  Several years ago, USTDA funded an Orientation Visit for wind power officials, but projects were slow to develop due to inadequate government policies.  USTDA recently funded a feasibility study for a geothermal power plant project in Turkey.  

The DM consultant would review four private sector-sponsored projects, including two small hydropower projects and two wind power projects.  The consultant would also look for other opportunities for USTDA assistance in renewable energy.
