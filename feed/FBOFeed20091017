<DESC>PROJECT DETAILS:  This project is located about 30 miles southeast of Las Vegas, Nevada, on US93 within the Hoover Dam Reservation Area and Lake Mead National Recreation Area.  The alignment crosses the Arizona/Nevada state line as a US93 Bypass of Hoover Dam.   

The project consists of Schedule A and Option X.  Schedule A includes final roadway improvements along the 4.4 miles of new mainline alignment along with interchange ramps and access roads near each end of the project. Option X, if exercised, includes utilities, sidewalk, surfacing and striping of a parking lot and access road, and aggregate surfacing of a trail.  This contract has multiple Notice to Proceeds and varying time periods for gaining access to and phasing portions of the work. 

Schedule A:  Approximately 70% of the project length requires open-graded friction course (OGFC) surfacing over existing hot-asphalt concrete pavement (HACP). The remainder of the project requires minor excavation and embankment to construct subgrade and surfacing at the project tie-ins to existing US93, pavement removal and roadway widening, drainage improvements (new pipe and drop inlet structures, slotted drains, adjustments to existing drop inlets, ditches, and riprap), W-beam and thrie-beam guardrail, wildlife fence, minor Portland cement concrete pavement (PCCP), and placing of aggregate base, HACP and OGFC. The project also includes concrete barriers, signing, and pavement marking throughout the entire alignment, interchange lighting and miscellaneous other work.  All work is in accordance with state and interstate design and construction standards.

Option X:  Work includes excavation and placement of waterline and sewerline conduit, placing aggregate base, HACP and PCCP surfacing, curb, and striping on the pedestrian plaza parking lot and access road, installing an electrical system through the parking lot and in the pedestrian plaza area, and miscellaneous minor work including aggregate surfacing of a trail.  

Public traffic currently uses existing US93 to access Hoover Dam from Nevada and Arizona, as well as two of the project interchange ramps and access roads near the end of the project causing impacts to construction of the tie-ins at the ends of the project and at the parking lot access road. Traffic delays and lane closures are subject to limitations. Construction sequencing and traffic control will be necessary for work within those areas of public traffic interaction. Access to mainline is anticipated to be at the ends of the project only with strict security requirements within the Hoover Dam Reservation area.

Active construction projects are ongoing within the project limits.  The Colorado River Bridge project is an integral part of the Hoover Dam Bypass located near the center of the project limits.  Access for any work within the designated areas of mainline occupied by the River Bridge contractor is restricted until the second NTP is issued.  Access to the parking lot, entrance road and trail is restricted until the third NTP is issued.  Coordination and access for the River Bridge Contractor’s operations must be maintained while both projects are under construction.  At the Arizona end of the project, an Arizona Department of Transportation project includes grading and surfacing improvements within the project limits and continuing to the south between US 93 Arizona milepost limits 2 and 17. Coordination for construction operations, moving materials and labor within the site, and for use or restriction of the roadways leading to and from the site is required. 

The work is anticipated to begin in January 2010 and end in December 2010 at the latest. This high-profile project is a critical link to transportation along the US93 corridor and ties in with roadway improvements to the south. Completion of this project removes the bottleneck at Hoover Dam and allows commercial trucking to resume using this section of the route.  As such, this contract includes substantial completion incentives for completing the work ahead of the scheduled completion date.  Significant disincentive penalties are also included in the contract.  

Estimated cost $8.0 to $10.0 million

Tentative Advertisement Date is October 29, 2009.

Armstrong Medical Industries, Inc. is a Veteran Owned Small Business that provides these Crash Carts for VA Puget Sound Health Care System.6.  Actions to Promote Competition:  No actions are taken at this time to seek sources outside of statutory requirements.7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price:  The anticipated price to the Government is $191,812.00.   All items were prices on average were discounted 24.5% from the Vendor's published catalog list prices and are comparable to similar items found on the Federal Supply Schedule.  In addition, this award will result in cost savings by preventing the VA from acquiring all new crash carts and the associated costs (training of staff, delivery, assembly, etc.). 8.  Market Survey (FAR 7.102): Based on market research this VOSB is capable and experienced providing crash carts to the VA.  This vendor provided the initial set of crash carts to the VA Puget Sound Healthcare Systems and this award will allow the VA to standardize to the existing carts and therefore represents the best value to the government.  9.  Other Considerations: Standardization of this emergency response equipment to carts currently in use at the American Lake campus is necessary as non-standardization would increase confusion of supply location and availability, which could lead to life-threatening delays in treatment.  Extensive medical documentation demonstrates that any delay in response to a cardiac or stroke event directly affects the outcome and recovery of the patient.  It is the standard of care to standardize code carts so that any member of the code team can respond without hesitation.  Response includes accessing medications, supplies and equipment that are located identically on every crash cart in the system.  The code team trains and drills to improve response time; it would be directly contradictory to the goal of urgent response to train staff on different brands and models of carts.The proposed cart has a number of features that will improve staff and patient safety, including aluminum construction, higher profile, securable individual drawers, and a secure medication drawer.10.  Listing of Sources that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition: No sources have expressed in writing an interest in this acquisition.11.  Statement of Actions to Overcome Barriers to Competition: No actions intended as the action is based on statutory authority for sole source.  12.  Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a bonafide need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.  //SIGNED//__________________________________	 23 September 2009Name:      Thomas R.

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRSJustification and ApprovalForOther Than Full and Open Competition1.	 Contracting Organization: Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 20, Puget Sound Medical Center2.	Description of Action:  This is a request for other than full and open competition for the procurement of LifeCare PCA Pump with Hospira software and firmware from Hospira.3.	Description of Supplies or Services:  The LifeCare RCA Pump will be used for the treatment of pain post surgery, end of life, cancer pain and with the Marrow Transplant patients. Pain is the fifth vital sign and we want all outpatients pain treated adequately and with the appropriate medication, dose and route of administration. The LifeCare RCA pump has firmware and software, IV tubing and prefilled syringes. The cost of the the firmware is $111.351.00.4.	Statutory Authority: (X) (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements;( ) (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency;( ) (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability, or Expert Services;( ) (4) International Agreement( ) (5) Authorized or Required by Statute; ( ) (6) National Security; or( ) (7) Public Interest5.	Validity of Use of Statutory Authority :  The PCA Pumps were purchased from a required source via FSS contract number V797P-4818A.   Hospira is the only known vendor that is capable of fulfilling this requirement for the PCA firmware.   A PCA Pump Committee was formed to conduct market research on PCA pumps suitable for the medical center.  The current Abbott LifeCare 4000 PCA pump's technology is over 20 years old and the pumps are breaking down and unable to be repaired economically. Market research revealed only 3 pumps that would meet the medical center's requirements: hospital grade, no peripherals, able to purchase prefilled syringes, safety alarms, and low settings, able to program for Dilaudid RCA (have Dilaudid or hydromorphone displayed on the screen) and free flow protection. One of the 3 pumps on the list was not FDA approved and one of the pumps has been recalled by Baxter, which left the Hospira Life PCA Pump.  The Hospira PCA Pump was the only product that met all of the requirements outlined by the medical center.6.	Actions to Promote Competition: The first half of this requirement was available on the Federal Supply Schedule under a limited sources basis.  However, based on the results of the market research, no further actions are taken at this time to seek sources outside of statutory requirements.7.	Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price:  The estimated price to the Government is $111,351.00 and is determined fair and reasonable.  The price includes the integrated implementation fee, an annual subscription user fee for core (wired) software package and E-Learning fee. The vendor provided a substantial discount for the entire order (the PCA pumps were discounted 17 percent from the FSS prices already determined fair and reasonable).   8.	Other Considerations: One of the main safety issues on our current RCA pumps is the inability to have the pump readout Dilaudid in the display, we are using more Dilaudid for PCA (pharmacy compounds the Dilaudid in empty sterile syringes provided by Abbott). The software for the new Hospira pumps have barcode reading technology so the pump will know if there is a Morphine vial with 5mg/cc, Morphine lmg/cc or a compounded Dilaudid syringe with .5mg/cc. This would prevent one of the programming errors involved in setting up the RCA pump. The software allows for drug libraries to be set up for different care areas that can be chosen. Later if the hospital were to have CPOE that would talk to the Hospira pump; by use of a scanner the pump would know if the right patient was receiving the right medication, dosage, concentration and even the nurse who scanned the drug.9.	Requirements Certification: I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a bonafide need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.//Signed//								21 Sep 09Frankie Manning	DateNurse Executive, VA Puget Sound HCS10.
