Pricing is based on a percentage of the savings; if there is no savings, there is no payment to the contractor.

Savings are defined as the difference between the VA allowable (the amount the VA would pay) and the contractor’s preferred price.

The VAMC will document the amount VA will pay on the invoice and forward invoices greater than $150 to the contractor.  The contractor shall verify the provider’s best price for the services claimed, returning the information to the VAMC.  The VAMC will select the lesser of the two prices for payment.  The contractor shall prepare an individual pricing form for every invoice and return it to the VAMC with the discounted price clearly written on it.  The contractor shall pay for overnight or second-day shipping when it is used.  The contractor shall provide the capability to exchange invoices electronically using HIPAA-compliant transactions.

The contractor is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements and quality control.  The following FAR provisions and clauses are applicable to this procurement:  52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items; 52.212-3 ALT I, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items; 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - and 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items.

While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of quotes, the final award decision will be based Price and Past Performance with Past Performance being more important than Price, and for purposes of efficiency, the Government intends to limit this evaluation to only the three lowest-price quoters that have relevant past performance.  The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest quoter.  The quoter shall submit, as part of its quote, information concerning its most relevant three contracts that have been performed within the past three years for efforts that are similar to the Statement of Work (SOW) contained herein, to include only the name and address of the organization for which the effort was supplied, and the number (phone, fax or Internet) of a contact for each contract listed.

Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  However, the quote of a company with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the responses of other quoters.  The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  The assessment of the quoter’s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS:  This solicitation is being issued on an unrestricted basis inviting full and open competition.  This is a two-step design/build construction project, Request for Proposals, Number N40083-06-R-4006.

It is the intent and objective of the Government to obtain services including labor, material, transportation, equipment and supervision required to repair and renovate the exterior and interior of Building 1, Naval Station, Great Lakes, Illinois.  Exterior work includes repair or replacement of terra cotta, face brick; tuck-pointing and roof, and repair of the clocks in the tower.  Interior repairs and renovations include electrical, plumbing, and fire sprinkler/alarm systems and HVAC utilizing existing steam service. Disturbed lead base paint and asbestos containing material are to be removed and disposed of.  Bid options include: window repair; installation of interior and exterior ramps and an elevator and ADA compliant restrooms; and replacement of acoustical ceiling tiles as required.  The successful proposer will be required to validate the design against the RFP requirements and accept design responsibility (i.e. sign and seal design drawings and specifications by registered professional engineers and architects).  The RFP will provide the project program, site survey, hazardous materials investigations, and prescriptive and performance specifications.  The RFP will not include a floor plan or design solution.

The estimated cost of the entire project is in the range of $11,000,000 to $13,000,000.  The NAICS Code for this proposed procurement is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction and the annual size standard is NTE $28.5 Million.  

Phase I Request for Proposals (RFP) will be available for viewing and downloading on or about 3 February 2006.  Proposal due date will be 3 March 2006, 2:00 p.m. Central Time.  The solicitation is formatted as an RFP in accordance with the requirements designated by sections of FAR 15.203 and NFAS for a negotiated procurement utilizing the Two-Phase Design-Build section procedures of FAR 36.3.  This method permits evaluation of proposals based on price competition, technical merit and other factors; permits impartial and comprehensive evaluation of offerors’ proposals; permits discussions if necessary; and ensures selection of the source whose performance provides the best value to the Government.

This solicitation will consist of two (2) phases.  Phase I is the qualification phase.  Up to five (5) firms will be pre-qualified to participate in Phase II.  The Navy will determine which offerors proceed to Phase II.  The evaluation factors for Phase I are as follows:  Past Performance and Relevant Project Experience, Technical Qualifications, Small Business Sub-Contracting Effort, and Management Approach. 

Upon determination of the contractors advancing to Phase II, those offerors will receive an RFP containing current and future design specifications.  Phase II will include the following evaluation factors:  Past Performance and Relevant Project Experience, Technical Qualifications and Management Approach (same as Phase I unless conditions change); Small Business Sub-Contracting Effort; Conceptual Facility Design; Conceptual Design Solution; Durability, Maintainability, Sustainability of Building Systems; and Project Schedule and Phasing.
 
The Government intends on issuing the RFP Solicitation for Phase I and Phase II through the Internet at www.esol.navfac.navy.mil.  All prospective offerors MUST register themselves on the website.  The download time may be excessive, but all contractors are encouraged to attempt download prior to obtaining the solicitation through alternate sources.  Many firms and commercial printing services have the capability to print the solicitation package and plan holders list off the Internet, if necessary.  The official plan holders list will be created by registration and be available from the website only.  Amendments will also be posted on the website for downloading.  This will be the normal method for distributing amendments, therefore it is the offerors’ responsibility to check the website periodically for any amendments to this solicitation.  

Offers will not be publicly opened.  The number of offers received, the identity of the offers received, the amount of any offer or relative standing of the offers will not be disclosed to anyone until the time of contract award.  

IMPORTANT NOTICE:  All contractors submitting bids, proposals or quotes on Department of Defense solicitations must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) prior to award of the contract.  The purpose of this database is to provide basic business information, capabilities and financial information to the Government.  The CCR website can be accessed at www.ccr.gov. Reference is made to DFARS Clause 252.204-7004, Required Central Contractor Registration.  You are encouraged to register as soon as possible.  All new contracts can ONLY be made to contractors who are registered in CCR.  This requirement will apply to all solicitations and awards, regardless of the media used.

<DESC>The Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) Customer Support Group (CSG), intends to award a sole sources bridge contract for technical services support for the United States Pacific Command (USPACOM).  

USPACOM has a requirement for continuation of technical services for Joint Training System Specialist (JTSS) support for Han Kuang Joint Exercise Life Cycle (JELC) development and management and provide JTSS support to assist in development and preparation of the Taiwan Joint Training Management System (TJTMS) implementation plan and prototype documents, required for rapid TJTMS development for a for a base period of performance of seven months from 1 March 2006 through 31 September 2006, with additional one month options that may be exercised beginning on 1 October 2006 for a possible total period of performance from 1 March 2006 to 28 February 2007.

The total estimated value is $215,000.

The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304c(1) as cited in FAR 6.302-1, “Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.”  The above services are currently being performed by Camber Corporation for USPACOM under contract whose period of performance will expire on or about 28 February 2006.  No other company has knowledge of the classified information necessary, nor has performed joint training system support in Taiwan.

Camber Corporation is the only contractor that can supply the unique exercise services for the following reasons:

- the only company that has performed the joint training system tasks with the client since 2003

- the only company that has synchronized these tasks, with other classified documents and events, and understands the unique political sensitivities related to this work

- the only company with extensive experience in helping Taiwan design, execute, and assess their joint exercise program in accordance with lessons learned from previous exercises

- if this effort were competed at this late date, the Government would incur costs in excess of their current very tight budget. 

To continue these services without interruption, and to provide a smooth transition to a new contractor requires that this bridge contract be awarded to Camber Corporation.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for Mission Assurance Services to extend the current contract for 6 months. NASA intends to award a sole-source contract extension to SRS Technologies Information Services Division (SRS) pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source under Contract NAS5-00241.  This procurement is to extend the current contract for up to 6 months, in support of NASA/GSFC Office of Systems Safety (OSSMA) The current contractor provides the following services to NASA GSFC OSSMA: personnel, materials and facilities to provide Mission Assurance Engineering Services, System Safety Services, Reliability Services, Continuous Risk Management Services, and Information Technology Services. NASA intends to extend the existing contract for a period of 6 months, from February 28, 2006 to August 28, 2006. These services provide a wide range of support and are essential to the NASA/GSFC environment.  This work relates to safety and is essential for mission success. SRS has managed the current contract for the past 5 years and has the infrastructure in place to provide these services on short notice, for the brief period of the extension. The current contractor has the experience, management skills, and trained personnel to carry out the day-to-day operations and meet required schedules.  Because of the time involved in procuring and phasing-in services from another contractor and because of the short term nature of the contract extension, SRS is considered to be the only source capable of meeting NASA's needs. Any other firms desiring consideration are requested to fully identify their interest and capabilities within 15 day of the date of publication of this synopsis to the NASA/GSFC Office and contact listed above.  See Note 22.

<CONTACT>LINDA M. MERRYMAN, Placement Contracting Officer, Phone: (513) 487-2037, E-Mail: merryman.linda@epa.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), has a requirement to purchase and install a Total Sulfur by Oxidative Pyrolysis and UV Fluorescence Detection Instrument to meet specifications of ASTM D5453.  As part of the Clean Air Act and its Amendments, a variety of emissions regulations have been implemented for vehicles and engines. The U.S. EPA National Vehicle and Fuels Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL) has the responsibility for testing vehicles and engines to ensure compliance with regulations. The fuels used for that testing also are analyzed at NVFEL to ensure compliance with the specifications as detailed in the regulations. These fuels are used to conduct low level emissions testing, of the highest precision and accuracy, on a broad range of vehicles and engines. In its role as a National Laboratory for the measurement of regulated emissions, and fuel quality, NVFEL plays a critical role in those measurements. To support that role, EPA seeks to purchase a Total Sulfur by Oxidative Pyrolysis and UV Fluorescence Detection Instrument to perform sulfur analyses of finished fuels and commercial blendstocks by ASTM method D5453.  All requirements of ASTM method D5453 shall be met. For the equipment specified, the contractor shall have total system responsibility, which shall include all phases of the project, design/configuration, assembly, integration, quality assurance, delivery to EPA-NVFEL, installation, calibration, commissioning, acceptance testing, documentation and training of EPA staff.  The contractor shall be responsible for documenting measurement traceability and system acceptance in a manner suitable for audit to ISO standards.  The contractor shall abide and comply with any relevant building and safety codes specified by NEC, OSHA, and NFPA wherever they might apply, to create a safe system and work environment.  It is necessary that the Data Systems of this instrument be easily networked with the existing Chem Lab network, which will be running Windows 2000, and potentially Windows XP in the future. The contractor shall be responsible for the necessary hardware and software to operate the system according to specifications. Shipping, delivery, and installation in the NVFEL lab shall be included.  The contractor is responsible for demonstrating that the supplied instrument meets all stated specifications, at the time of installation and checkout in NVFEL?s laboratory. The contractor shall provide training on the complete system.   Training shall consist of on-site operator training at the time of installation, followed by operation and maintenance training courses for at least two people at the manufacturer?s facility, on the same model that EPA has purchased, including software training on the same software package.  All acceptance testing shall be the responsibility of the contractor.  The contractor shall warranty all parts, labor, control systems, and equipment for the performance and functionality of its systems for a minimum of one year after formal EPA system acceptance and approval.  The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) code for this requirement is 334513. This solicitation will be issued under full and open competition.  Award will be made on a Best Value basis.   The Government anticipates award of a Firm-Fixed Price type contract.    Point of Contact for this requirement is Linda Merryman, Contract Specialist, at (513) 487-2037, or via e-mail at merryman.linda@epa.gov.  A copy of the solicitation may be obtained from the EPA?s Office of Acquisition Management (OAM), Cincinnati Procurement Operations Division?s (CPOD) website on or about February 1, 2006.  The EPA/OAM/CPOD website URL is: http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd/     No paper copies of the solicitation will be provided.  All responsible business concerns may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.

<DESC>The Global Broadcast Service (GBS) provides worldwide, high capacity, one-way transmission of video, imagery and other information supporting deployed forces in transit and in an Area of Operation (AOR). It employs readily available satellite-based broadcast commercial technologies which are relative inexpensive and easily integrated into existing systems and processes, yet not so unwieldy as to be unusable by smaller and more mobile units.  To this end, GBS currently uses broadcast payloads on three Ultra-High Frequency Follow-On (UFO) satellites and two leased commercial operated geosynchronous satellites transponders.  A Theater Injection Point (TIP) terminal provides a deployable Ka-band uplink capability that can operate directly from a Combatant Commander’s (COCOM’s) AOR.

Phone: (56-2) 696-4787 / 449-3402 Fax:   (56-2) 698-5048   Airport Improvements and Airspace Optimization in the Central Zone of Chile.  The National Airport Directorate of the Ministry of Public Works in Chile (“the Grantee”) invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to conduct technical assistance on airport improvements and airspace optimization in the Central Zone of Chile.

The National Directorate of Airports (Dirección Nacional de Aeropuertos) of Chile’s Ministry of Public Works is charged with the planning, design, and construction of airfield, terminal and landside facilities. The Director of Airports is a permanent member of Chile’s Civil Aviation Committee, which is the highest civil aviation authority in the country and whose members also include the DGAC.  In response to growing demand in air traffic, the National Airport Directorate needs a system plan to identify and plan new airport infrastructure and to determine how to apply new technologies to optimize the use of airspace.   The Technical Assistance has two main objectives:

1)	Development of a system plan for Chile’s Central Zone, specifically Regions V, VI and the Metropolitan Region.  The purpose of the system plan is to determine the type, extent, location, timing and cost of airport development needed to develop a viable system of airports.  This includes identifying the function/role of specific airports and identifying the capital improvements needed to achieve the proposed performance standard as well as identifying the need for any new airports.  The system plan includes an assessment of the dynamics that generate a demand for air transportation services and facilities and the results serve as an input to future master planning and the design of each system airport.

2)	Evaluation of alternatives means to optimize airspace capacity in the Central Zone.  The Central Zone generates the majority of aviation activity in Chile, including overflights of north and south-bound air traffic. The technical assistance will assess the introduction and application of new technologies and procedures that can be used to optimize airspace capacity.

The following is a summary of the main tasks of the technical assistance.

1.	Inventory Analysis
2.	Forecasts of Aviation Demand
3.	Performance Measures
4.	Airport Functional Assessment
5.	Systems Alternatives
6.	Airspace Optimization
7.	Economic and Financial Feasibility, including development impact assessment 
8.	Potential U.S. Sources of Supply
9.	Implementation Program
10.	 Reports, including interim reports and Final Report;

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $359,350 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) intends to award a modification on a sole-source basis to Jeffrey W. Bates, Vienna, VA, pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, for the continued IT support of the Walter Reed Biosystematics Uni t (WRBU) co-located with the Smithsonian Institution Museum Support Annex in Silver Hill, MD.  Due to the specific requirements of the work carried out by the WRBU (the creation of computer-based products for the identification of militarily important dise ase vectors) and their location at the Smithsonian Institution, they use a non-WRAIR computer network for their work.  Since computer support is not available from WRAIR, a failure of network connectivity, data backup, or individual CPUs would result in a significant decrement in work output and impact on the WRBUs ability to complete this critical USAMRMC-funded research..  To switch to another vendor at this point would  result in the duplication of costs to the Government that is not expected to be reco vered through competition.  USAMRAA intends to award this modification under Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  A firm-fixed-price-type modification is planned.  The period of performance will be eight months.  Interested respondents who feel that they ar e capable of meeting these requirements may identify their interest by submitting technical documentation and resumes demonstrating capability to Dana Herndon at FAX No. 301-619-3002 by 3:00 p.m. E.S.T., Friday, 3 February 2006.  This notice of intent is n ot a request for competitive proposals.  No telephone requests will be accepted.

<DESC>USPS Materials Production and Distribution (MP&D), Supply Management, provides support to the US Postal Service with regard to the receipt, storage and distribution of (1) repair parts for all automated and mechanized mail processing equipment (2) supplies (forms, tags, handbooks, retail products, etc.), and (3) equipment (lockboxes, mail sorting tables, etc.).

USPS MP&D provides inventory support for new programs with duration of 5 years or less.  New programs requiring warehousing and distribution support are often implemented in an independent and non-integrated fashion, resulting in higher costs to the Postal Service.  Significant cost savings would result if the Postal Service were to partner and implement a standardized approach for the warehousing and distribution of inventory required for these new programs.

The approach being considered by USPS MP&D involves contracting with a 3PL provider for warehousing and distribution support for new short-term Postal Service programs.  This approach would allow the Postal Service to have in place a proven 3PL provider possessing the required system interfaces necessary to interact with postal systems.  This approach would also provide the USPS with access to a preferred logistics company which could provide real-time cost estimates to meet requirements as they arise.  Additionally, it would provide an alternative to supplier-provided distribution, thus reducing the purchasing cycle time for the entire program.

<DESC>USPTO Image Interpretation COTS RFI

The purpose of this RFI is to obtain information and sources regarding the availability of COTS Image Content Evaluation Software.  

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) seeks to determine the current state of image content interpretation technology and see if it has an appropriate cost to benefit ratio for incorporation into our I/T environment.  Such software is intended to expand the choices presented for initial classification of Trademarks applications submitted to the USPTO.  Trademarks are a distinctive name, symbol, motto, or design that legally identifies a company, or its products and services. The Trademark image formats are JPEG and TIFF.  Future plans will include PDF format.

The symbols as part of a Trademark Registration request are indexed into various categories used as mechanism to ensure there are no conflicts with existing Trademarks.  The Registration request is allowed (granted) if found to be unique.  There is a stringent examination process before registration is granted, not only based on the comparison of images. Quite often the image has features, not mentioned in the description, but are important Trademark considerations. We believe image interpretation software could automatically extend the initial presented list.  The classifier would review the results, adding missed features, or remove erroneous recommendations.  Our question is, will image content interpretation COTS present a fairly complete set of valid choices, without adding too many erroneous choices?

At NO COST to the USPTO, we are looking for vendors that can supply image interpretation COTS software that could be integrated into our Classification process.  The goal is for the COTS product to locate, as many “real” objects within a Trademark Registration image.  We will map these objects to index values for Trademarks. Frequently, Trademark images have minimal object outlines or only a portion of real world objects, e.g. a partial outline of a bird’s wing.  This information will be used in addition to the current descriptive text for offering indexing suggestions.

At this point in time we are NOT attempting to locate a series of images based on an object search, e.g. find all images with a bird’s wing.  Instead, we are attempting to automatically interpret incoming Trademark images to find all “real” objects in an image.

Any product to be considered by the USPTO must be commercially available, “shrink wrapped” product, with standard tech support, periodic upgrades, etc.  The USPTO is not interested in research and prototypes efforts.
 
As part of this RFI, the USPTO will supply, upon request, a CD with sample Trademarks to assist the USPTO in its evaluation of available COTS software.  Should a vendor participate in this evaluation, after 45 days of the USPTO mailing the CD, the USPTO will request a written response with the results of the vendor’s product against all of the supplied images.  Your company’s written results shall include, for all USPTO supplied images, the software specified objects located by image id.  Upon request, the USPTO will provide all the object choices manually found in each image. In lieu of this written evaluation, a visit to the USPTO with a demonstration and your results is also acceptable.

Upon the conclusion of this phase of the RFI, the USPTO may request a 90-day evaluation copy of your product.

This is a RFI only. A solicitation package is not available. For questions regarding this RFI, please contact Hope Smith, Contracting Officer, at (571) 272-6565.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command; Aircraft Support Contracts Department (AIR 2.5.1.3), Patuxent River, MD  20670-1127 announces its intention to procure on a competitive basis, the materials and services necessary for the the design, fabrication, installation, delivery, and technical support of Crew Chief Crash Attenuating Seat Systems (CCCASS) for possible integration into the CH-53D, CH-53E, MH-53E, CH-46E, HH-46D, and HH-46E aircraft.  The CCCASS is intended for retrofit into Navy/Marine Corps CH-53D, CH-53E, MH-53E, CH-46E, HH-46D and HH-46E aircraft for crew chief/gunner and aerial observer seating stations.  THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  It is a market research tool being used to determine potential and eligible small business firms capable of providing these services prior to determining the method of acquisition and issuance of a Request for Proposal.  Therefore, only interested small businesses are encouraged to respond.  The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this synopsis.  

INTRODUCTION:   

The CH-53D, CH-53E, MH-53E, CH-46E, HH-46D and HH-46E lack crashworthy crew chief/gunner and aerial observer seats, exposing aircrew members to higher risk of injury or death in the event of a hard landing, crash or aircraft rollover.  Current crew chief/gunner and aerial observer stations provide limited compatibility with existing aircrew mission requirements.  Operational demands require that the crew chief/gunner/aerial observer be positioned at the main cabin door or window aft of the cockpit for extended periods of time.  Pilots have an energy-absorbing seat in the cockpit.  However, the aircraft’s crew chief is the single occupant not provided with a crash-attenuating seat.  While the crew chief may choose to occupy an existing CATSS seat elsewhere in the cabin, this reduces the number of seats available for passengers by one.  Further, the crew chief needs a seat in close proximity to the cockpit in order to properly perform his duties.  The lack of a crash attenuating seat for the crew chief exposes this crewmember to much higher risk of injury or death in the event of a hard landing, crash, or aircraft rollover.  The US Navy/Marine Corps has need for a crashworthy crew chief/gunner and aerial observer seat for use on CH-53D, CH-53E, MH-53E, CH-46E, HH-46D and HH-46E helicopters.  

REQUIREMENTS:

The anticipated contract effort includes, but is not limited to the following:

The contractor shall be required to design, fabricate, test for qualification, and produce a Crew Chief Crash Attenuating Seat System (CCCASS) that addresses safety/injury mitigation issues concerning the crew chief/gunner/aerial observer while performing flight operations and deliver said crashworthy seat for installation as an appropriately oriented seat on the right hand side of the CH-53D, CH-53E, and MH-53E helicopters, and as an appropriately oriented seat for installation into the CH-46E, HH-46D and HH-46E helicopter.  Additionally, the design, fabrication, and production of interim spares and maintenance trainer kits shall be required.  Furthermore, it is desirable to have the same seat installed in the CH-53D, CH-53E, AND MH-53E as well as in the CH-46E, HH-46D, and HH-46E, with little or no aircraft modifications.  Specifically, the contractor shall be required to provide design improvements or new development to certify that the seats meet or exceed the qualification test requirements.

TECHNICAL QUALIFICATIONS:
The CCCASS shall be comprised of a single occupant crash resistant seat, 4- or 5-point restraint system, an MA-16 inertia reel, headrest, aircraft interface/reinforcement attaching hardware, and all aircraft modifications required for the installation and functioning of the CCCASS in the CH-53D, CH-53E, MH-53E, CH-46E, HH-46D and HH-46E aircraft.  

The primary goal of this effort is to achieve maximum crew chief/gunner/aerial observer accommodation without degrading performance of the seat design.  The contractor will be required to prepare a Detailed Stress Analysis Report detailing the depth of application and evaluation of the load path for the static and dynamic seat-to-airframe attachment loads.  The report shall take into consideration the final seat and seat-to-airframe attachment structural design and shall insure that all of the requirements of the CCCASS Performance Specification are met.  Additionally, a complete Parts List defining the seat and all necessary components as required for installation will be required. All kits, including individual installation modification kits, must include a complete kit content list, including piece parts.  The contractor shall provide developmental Drawings and Associated Lists for seat components.  The contractor shall be required to develop and submit all necessary source data required to update maintenance and system description, to include Illustrated Parts Breakdown to the repairable/replaceable parts level and Maintenance and Overhaul instructions, into the government aircraft organizational level, intermediate level and NATOPS manuals.  All technical source data will become government property. Technical publication source data shall include, but is not limited to the following:  Seat installation, including installation modification kits, if necessary, and removal instructions that include component placement information.  Instructions shall include identification, weight and the location of their center of gravity when installed, to aid in weight and balance calculations.  An inventory listing with pictures referencing part numbers and units per assembly included for the seats.  Maintenance instructions for the life preservation of components, maintenance procedures required resulting from the installation or removal of the seat, and instructions for preparation of the containers or components for long term storage. Inspection procedures that permit user level inspection of the system that shall identify:  Inspection interval and periodic maintenance requirements (i.e., Daily, Phase, etc).  Required maintenance due to use or abuse.  Visual degradation indicators identifying the condition and the level of protection that the system provides if it degrades gradually over the life of the system.  Performance life end, where the system is at the point that it is unable to achieve threshold performance and repeatability requirements. Packing/Storage instructions that detail how to pack the uninstalled seats into the packing/shipping container.  Operational procedures and instructions for proper use and adjustment.  The contractor shall provide a list of all hazardous materials used within the delivered CCCASS shipset, as defined by 29 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) 1910.1200 Occupational Safety and Health Standards Hazard Communication.

QUALIFICATION TESTING:  The contractor shall be required to supply and produce up to twenty-one complete seats, to be utilized in qualification testing. The contractor will be required to install each seat and appropriate interface hardware into a CH-53D, CH-53E, MH-53E, CH-46E, HH-46D and HH-46E aircraft.  The seats will be installed to verify installation and removal procedures, aircraft integration, operational compatibility, system safety, anthropometric accommodation assessment and maintenance procedures.  The government shall be responsible for conducting the anthropometric accommodation assessment.  All fitting tasks are to be performed at Patuxent River, Maryland and/or Naval Aviation Depot Cherry Point, North Carolina with the Government present.  Additionally, a Qualification Test Report shall be provided to the government representatives.  

INTEGRATED LOGISTICS SUPPORT:  The contractor shall be required to develop and propose the maintenance concept for the CCCASS.  The maintenance concept shall include minimum storage life and minimum installed service life for the CCCASS.  An approach that minimizes or excludes a requirement for maintenance is considered advantageous to the Government.
	
PRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF CCCASS:  The anticipated contract will have Option CLINS for production units, interim spares, and Maintenance Trainer Kits.  Therefore, following successful completion of the nonrecurring engineering effort, the government shall have the right to exercise option for the production units, interim spares, and Maintenance Trainer Kits. Under these options, the contractor shall perform the effort required for the fabrication, acceptance testing and delivery of production CCCASS assets.  The contractor shall manufacture the CCCASS units in accordance with the approved and finalized drawing package.  A and B kits are anticipated for each aircraft type/model/series.   The B kit shall consist of a seat, and an A kit shall consist of the integration hardware necessary to attach the seats to the existing aircraft structure. The goal is to have commonality between systems.  It is recognized that a unique A kit may be required for all type/model/series.  Each kit shall include a complete Parts List. Maintenance trainer kits shall consist of the seats and any integration hardware necessary to attach the seat to the existing aircraft type/model/series trainer asset.  The contractor shall provide the Interim support spares listed on the approved Interim Support Items List (ISIL) to the government.

BSA/BNL has a requirement for a 300 kV transmission electron microscope (TEM)  designed to provide an optimum combination of in-situ capabilities for high-resolution imaging, diffraction, and spectroscopy (energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS), electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), and/or spectroscopy imaging) in an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) environment.  Special requirements include observing chemical reaction of nanometric particles in the TEM with a wide range of temperature and gas pressure for catalysis study.  The design for the TEM requires cutting-edge technology in differential pumping to achieve the required ultrahigh vacuum, while enabling to inject a high gas pressure for observing chemical reactions in-situ. 

The transmission electron microscope required will be a side-entry high resolution instrument with nano-probe analytical capabilities.  It requires the highest quality of the combined accomplishment on atomic-imaging point-to-point resolution (0.18nm), energy-spread (<0.7eV), and specimen tilt-angle (±45º) available with today’s technology.   

Known manufacturers capable of producing a 300kV, Ultra High Vacuum (UHV) analytical transmission electron microscope are:

Hitachi High Technologies America, Inc
JEOL, USA, Inc.

All other manufacturers interested in receiving a copy of the 300kV, Ultra High Vacuum (UHV) analytical transmission electron microscope Request for Proposal, when it is issued, should contact David J. Paveglio.

<DESC>The New York District intends to solicit and award a maintenance dredging project with contaminated dredged material for Glen Cove Creek, NY.  The project will be solicited by IFB.  This notice serves two purposes:  1) to notify potential dredging co ntractors and/or environmental services companies of the project, allowing them sufficient time to consider collaborative relationships; and 2) to determine if there will be an adequate number of interested and qualified contractors and or joint ventures t o perform the work described below.   The work to be performed will be the maintenance dredging of approximately 27,000 cubic yards of material from Glen Cove Creek, NY. During a previous maintenance dredging of the creek a small amount of radioactive material was discovered.  The radioactive material consists of discrete pieces of tungsten slag/ore in sizes from pea gravel to cobbles. This project will entail the completion of maintenance dredging of the creek with the placement of the dredged material in an upland disposal site provided immed iately adjacent to the creek.  The contractor will be required to construct a dike on the provided upland disposal site to contain the dredged material, with filtered dewatering required. Material for the construction of the dike will be provided by the Ci ty of Glen Cove if required. Immediately after the maintenance dredging of the creek, a radiological scan of the creek bottom will be performed by a government contractor to determine if any radiation hot spots still exist in the creek and if further dredg ing of those specific areas will be required.  The creek will be separated into acceptance areas to minimize operational delays due to the radiological scanning.  Due to the presence of radioactive material, additional safety and health precautions along w ith monitoring will be required at the site during the dredging operations. The material to be dredged is expected to range from sand to silt.  A significant amount of debris is expected to be encountered during the maintenance dredging of the creek, which is expected to consist of wooden piles, some boulder size stones and smalle r debris items.  The debris removed from the creek is to be sorted and disposed of at an approved upland disposal area.   In addition during the dredging of the creek some oily material areas are expected to be encountered and the contractor will be requir ed to provide booms to adequately contain the oil and control turbidity during the maintenance dredging operations.

FSIS requires beef, deer, pork, poultry, sheep and horse kits.  

Elisa Technologies Inc. is the only known source which can provide the required cooked species kits.  The required kits are USDA method specific; the protocol used for these kits is outlined in the USDA/FSIS Microbiology Lab Guidebook found at the following internet address:  http://www.fsis.usda.gov/ophs/microlab/mlg17.02.pdf

USDA, FSIS has performed extensive validation on these kits and has identified Elisa Technologies as the only company that includes controls that are individual species antibodies with each kit instead of all inclusive species antibodies. To further explain, the controls are specific to each kit (ex. the deer control is for the deer kit, and the beef control is for the beef kit, etc.) instead of having one general control applicable to each type of kit.  

This procurement will be conducted under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Authority: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1).  The kits will be shipped to our Eastern Lab which is located in Athens, GA.  It is anticipated that this procurement will be conducted as a Commercial Item acquisition under FAR Part 12.  It is also anticipated that an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract will be awarded.  The period of performance will be for a 12 month base period plus four (4) additional 12 month option periods.  This is not a request for quotations or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation.  Request for copies of this solicitation will not be honored or acknowledged.  The Government does not intend to pay for information received.  All interested parties must respond within ten (10) calendar days from the date of this notice.  Written responses must provide clear and concise documentation indicating your firms capability to provide the necessary kits.  Verbal responses are not acceptable and will not be considered.  When responding to this announcement, respondents should refer to Announcement #27110.  If after January 30, 2006, no viable responses have been received in response to this announcement, USDA/FSIS shall negotiate solely with Elisa Technologies Inc.

<SUBJECT>Y--Request for Information - Sealing System for Upper Stillwater Dam - Dam Rehabilitation, Phase 2
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Upper Colorado Regional Office intends to sole source for a sealing system.  This is not a request for proposals; this is a sources sought/request for other potential manufacturers and product information.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  The purpose of this sources sought/request for information is for market survey and to solicit industry feedback regarding other potential sealing systems to correct water leakage deficiencies associated with cracks on the upstream face at Upper Stillwater Dam, Duchesne County, Utah.  There are currently 14 cracks that have been identified for remediation.  Upper Stillwater Dam is a Roller Compacted Concrete Dam, at elevation 8,100 feet.  The area of sealer coverage for each crack is proposed to be 40-feet wide by 150-high.  Hydrostatic head is approximately 150-feet at the reservoir.  The sealing system will be applied in the dry.  Reclamation has identified the ISO Permaproof AG (Switzerland) PP-Dam(R) Sealing System as a system designed for application to the upstream dam face for sealing leaks and capable of handling cold weather environments; and intends to sole source this system in a future acquisition if other acceptalbe sealing systems are not identified at this time.  The ISO Permaproof PP-Dam(R) Sealing System consists of the following characteristics and the company has published the following test results for their system: Overall System Thickness: 1.  3 to 4 millimeters, depending on crack width to bridge. Multilayer System: 1.  A four-phase ductile plastic system consisting of a primer/adhesion layer, flexible support layer (thickness 2mm), sealing membrane (thickness 2mm), and ultra-violet protection layer.  Each layer is applied with differing colors to verify correct mixing and thicknesses.  The multicolor system allows for damage assessment of each layer.  Each layer has specific characteristics to create the sealing system. Very High Tear-Stretch and Tensile Tear Strength: 1.  Flexible Support Layer - Tear stretch at +20 degrees C = 1500% strain at 31 N/mm2. 2.  Flexible Support Layer - Tear stretch at -20 degrees C = 1000% strain at 51 N/mm2. 3.  Sealing Layer - Tensile tear strength at +20 degrees C = 500% strain at 60 N/mm2. 4.  Sealing Layer - Tensile tear strength at -20 degrees C = 510% strain at 65 N/mm2. Overall System Crack Coverage Capacity: 1.  Dynamic = 2cm 2.  Static > 5cm Substrate Bonding: 1.  > 1.5 N/mm2. Vapor Permeability Sd: 1.  2 to 3 meters Material Hardness: 1.  Shore-A Hardness = 92 degrees - 95 degrees. Minimum Application Temperature: 1.  +3 degrees C. Additional Characteristics: 1.  Perfect hardening at temperatures below 0 degrees C. 2.  System bonds to entire substrate with no seepage allowed underneath, and no drainage layer required between sealing layer and dam face. 3.  Low profile and resistant to 1-meter thick ice layers. 4.  Resistant to dynamic impact of ice. 5.  No change in material properties in first 100 years of operation, based on aging testing. 6.  Resistant to ultra-violet radiation. 7.  System waterproof even at high temperatures, resistant to frost, de-icing salt, root-growth, micro-organisms, and aggressive water. 8.  Certified safe for potable water. 9.  No mechanical protection required. 10.  No mechanical hardware needed for attachment. 11.  No other materials required (such as cloth sheeting or tapes). 12.  System is repairable if damaged. 13.  Proven successful performance on concrete dam installations in cold weather conditions for a period of at least 5 years. We invite other sealing systems manufacturers to notify Reclamation if they have sealing systems with salient characteristics meeting or exceeding the characteristics described above for the ISOPermaproof AG PP-Dam(R) Sealing System.  Manufacturers with information regarding other sealing systems need to contact Reclamation within 15 days; after the 15-day period, Reclamation will begin procurement of the ISO Permaproof AG PP-Dam(R) Sealing System.  Please submit responses to Mr. Cary Southworth (PRO-220), Bureau of Reclamation, Provo Area Office, 302 East 1860 South, Provo Utah  84606-7317.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Upgrade to Horiba Instruments Corporation PSS/HF47 Particulate Sampling Systems
<DESC>In accordance with FAR subpart 13.106-1(b), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)  seeks to award a contract on a Sole Source basis to Horiba Instruments Corporation, to obtain the parts and services required to upgrade Horiba Instruments Corporation PSS/HF47 Particulate Sampling Systems in Heavy-Duty Test Cell 5 (HD5) of the National Fuels and Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL) located in Ann Arbor, MI.  The NAICS is 334513.  Horiba Instruments Corporation is the only known source having the capability of  not only providing the necessary supplies required to perform the upgrade of the PSS/HF47 Particulate Sampling Systems in Heavy-Duty Test Cell 5, but also the technical capability and expertise to complete the  programming of Horibas Proprietary Micro-host Controller for the Particulate Sampling Systems (PSUs).  The use of parts, other than those designed to be installed on the PSU,  would void the warranty of the PSUs. 

As part of the Clean Air Act and its Amendments, a variety of emissions regulations have been implemented for vehicles and engines.  The U.S. EPA National Vehicle and Fuels Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL) has the responsibility for testing vehicles and engines to ensure compliance with regulations. 

This Horiba PSU utilizes smooth approach orifices (SAO) for measurement and control of total sample flow and secondary dilution air flow.  The SAOs delivered with the system were sized to achieve a pressure drop of 10 inches water column (WC) at a flow of 150 standard liters per minute (SLPM).  Current regulations, and best particulate matter, sampling practices, require that the air velocity at the filter face be no more than 100 cm/sec2.  The HF47 units were delivered with 47 mm Teflon membrane filter holders, and this size filter requires a maximum of about 62 SLPM total flow to achieve the maximum 100 cm/sec2 filter face velocity.

In order to achieve the best measurement resolution possible with these systems, the EPA requires the following upgrade for the HD5 system:
A)  Replace seven SAOs in each PSU with SAOs sized to achieve a 10 inch WC pressure drop at approximately 85 SLPM. 	B)  Make changes and adjustments to the systems computerized control system.	C)  After reassembling all components, leak check the system and verify proper performance of all measurement and flow control functions. 	D)  Verify all flow measurements with clean filters.  In addition, verify total sample flow measurements with filters with typical particulate loadings. E)   The calibration of the SAOs and the final flow verifications shall be reported in a manner consistent with the requirements of ISO 17025 Sections 5.10.2 and 5.10.4. 	F)  All modifications and repairs of the PSU/HF47 systems required to achieve the stated performance objectives are the responsibility of the contractor.  

In addition, there is a potential  requirement for the same type of upgrade for 3 additional PSUs as follows:  Option 1,  PSU located in LD Room 329 requires the SAO hardware/software upgrade and the coupling upgrade.	Option 2,  PSU located in HD Cell 2 requires the SAO hardware/software upgrade and the coupling upgrade.	Option 3,  PSU located in HD Cell 1 requires the SAO hardware/software upgrade.

  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability and  respond to the requirement by submitting documentation to the office identified above.  Documentation must be received by COB January 26, 2006 in order to be considered by the EPA.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon assessment of responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Telephone responses will not be honored.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) and the U.S. Army Medical Information Technology Center (USAMITC) intend to award to Tidal Software of Houston, Texas a contract for one year for the software Horizon 1.6.  Tidal Software is the designated source and sole possessor of the proprietary software and the sole source to sell the software cited herein.  Horizon has worked with Microsoft and SAP to ensure its inclusion of critical components needed to monitor SAP systems running o n Microsoft operating systems.  This software sits on a MOM server and supports TEWLS enterprise monitoring.  MOM is also used within the AMEDD Enterprise to monitor the Active Directory and Exchange servers.  The replacement of the TAMMIS system with TEWL S reduces the Armys risk of liability in supporting old and outdated logistic systems.  The new system will ensure the Armys ability to provide the best possible logistical system for all medical hospitals.  Market research has determined that Tidal Soft ware (Horizon 1.6) is the only and the leading solution used with MOM in monitoring SAP applications.  The standards and capabilities set using this combination of MOM and Tidal Software (Horizon 1.6) are required for the TEWLS to sustain a high level of a vailability.   With the support these systems provide in the war on global terrorism, market leading products are needed to help the current U.S. Army operation in Afghanistan and Iraq.  If other  vendors can provide these services, please respond as soon as possible.  Telephonic requests for information regarding this procurement will not be honored.

ITEM 0001: Innovason Input Module; DI-8Scr: AES Digital input module w/sample rate conversion.  This module is designed to convert AES digital audio signals entering the system to the internal formal.  On the front of the module there are four female XLR-3 connectors, number from 1/2 to 7/8.  The module makes it possible to receive four AES frames (or eight different audio signals) Programmable dynamic sensitivity range from -6 to +6  dB in increments of 0.1 dB
Balanced inputs 110 ohm, with levels and sensitivities subject to the AES standard
Sampling from 43 to 49 kHz according to the system is general clock or external synchronization
Programmable delay from 0 to 5 ms or equal.
ITEM  0002:  Innovason Output Module;  DO-8A:  AES Digital output module.  This module is designed to convert digital audio signals leaving the system to the AES format.  On the front of the module there are four female XLR-3  connectors, numbered from 1/2 to 7/8.  The module distributes four AES frames (or eight audio signals):  Balanced outputs 110 ohm, with levels subject to the AES standard;  Sampling from 43 to  49  kHz according to the system's general clock or external synchronization; Programmable output mutes or equal. 
 ITEM 0003: Innovason Analog Output; MO-8D3:  8 channel line analog output module/no processing.  This module is designed to convert digital audio signals leaving the system to analog.  On the front of the module there are eight male XLR-3  connectors, numbered from 1 to 8.  The module distributes eight analog signals: Balanced outputs with the level adjustable by jumbers of +11.5, +18 and +22 dB for an input signal at 0dBFs; Programmable output mutes Patch programmable using the operating software; 24-bit digital/analog conversion: 48 kHz, DeltaSigma type (oversampling: 64xfs). The MO 8D3 module may be installed in any audio rack, in slots B to H for the Stage Box or A to H for the Mix Box.  The DO-8A module may be installed in any audio rack, in slots B to H for the Stage Box and A to H for the Mix Box, depending on the position of the switch located on the card or equal.
ITEM  0004: Innovason Analog Input; SI-8D3:  8 channel 1/24 bit mic/line analog input module.  This module converts incoming signals in digital. The front panel has: Eight XLR female connectors, numbered 1 to 8.  Close to each connector, a green led for signal presence, a red led for clipping and a yellow led for Phantom Power.  The RED one is important as it indicates an analogue  pre-amp clipping, before the digital conversion. If lit, the pre-amp gain must be reduced, in extreme cases a 100 dB passive attenuator may be used.  This module may receive 8 analogue signals with following characteristics: Nominal sensitivity 12 dBu (gain at 0dB)
Balanced inputs, phantom power supply (+ 48V) switchable Analog to digital conversion: 24 bits, 48 kHz, Delta-sigma (128 over-sampling).  Programmable gain (1.5 dB steos) from - 27 to + 64.5 dB, sensitivity from 52.5 to +26 dBu or equal.
ITEM  0005:  Innovason Stage Box:  64 input stage box for Innovason consoles.  The Stage box is an audio rack and a transmission system that allows you to replace your heavy multi-core snake with a simple pair of coaxial cable, or with an optical fiber, thanks to the new MCSC Optical comm module.  XLR connector, preamplifiers, 48V, phase shifter, and converters are located in the Stage Box.  All the parameters are remote-controlled from the console and audio signals transmitted to the console, using coaxial cable or optical fiber.  The Stagebox is also a digital splitter which can feed two or three InnovaSon consoles.  With a small length of cable in the analog domain, all the audio signals come quickly into digital and keep an impressive internal headroom.  That's one of the numerous reasons responsible for the high sonic quality of the InnovaSon consoles.  The Stagebox comes as an option with the InnovaSon  consoles.  At any moment it's possible to add it other input or output (unprocessed) modules to improve the system resources or equal.
ITEM  0006:  Innovason Coaxial Cable; "Coax 150M": Coax 150M Drum, 450 ft of dual 75 ohm coaxial cable on cable reel or equal.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.

(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.

In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.

If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.

If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

<DESC>This is a combined Synopsis/Solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Sole source: TA Instruments, 109 Lukens Drive, New Castle, Delaware 19720-2795, CAGE: 0MJS5. Sole Source Justification: The Q100 DSC Testing System manufactured by TA Instruments is an extremely critical and unique piece of thermal analysis testing equipment that will be directly involved in production certification of composite materials, direct support for the advanced composites program office, and other critical projects involving thermal characterization of materials. The Laboratory currently has a TA Instruments Q600 SDT analyzer which is used to determine thermo gravimetric data of materials. The Q600 SDT analyzer utilizes a proprietary hardware controller and software which analyzes raw data in a proprietary file format. The Q100 DSC also manufactured by TA Instruments, utilizes the same hardware controller and analysis software which is a mandatory requirement of the laboratory to ensure data gathering accuracy and data analysis. It is therefore critical to procure the TA Instruments Q100 DSC Testing System in order to meet the requirements. No other supplier is known that can interface with the existing Q600 hardware controller and data analysis software needed to meet the requirements stated above. Anticipated award date: 08 FEB 2006. Electronic procedures will be used to solicit this acquisition.

<DESC>This amendment is issued to revise the combined solicitation/synopsis, and to respond to questions.  The combined solicitation/synopsis is amended by changing the FOB destination point to White Sands Missile Range, NM, in lieu of Redstone Arsenal, AL ; and to add the following requirement:  Copies of acceptance test procedures and test data sheets shall be provided.   Response to questions:  Question 1:  Is it Sole Source solicitation?  In the combined synopsis/solicitation it is not quite clear.  Answ er:  The requirement is sole source to Eagle Picher.  As set forth in the synopsis, the proposed contract action is for equipment for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, Eagle Picher Technologies.  The subject batter ies have been previously qualified after undergoing significant engineering and environmental testing by AMCOM and White Sands Missile Range, and no other source is known that can provide an equivalently qualified battery.  Eagle Picher is the only known s ource that produces the required qualified batteries.  Question 2:  Is it solicitation for the hardware (thermal battery) or for the equipment.  Both terms are used in the combined synopsis/solicitation.  Answer:  The requirement is for 10 each Eagle Piche r Thermal Batteries, part number EAP-12217; and 20 each Eagle Picher Thermal Batteries, part number EAP-12243.  Question 3:  What is the DPAS Rating?  Answer:  The DPAS Rating is DOA2.  Question 4:  Are you allowed to purchase these batteries from sources other than the manufacturer?  Also, how do we submit our bid?  Answer:  See answer to question 1.  The offer due date is extended to 24 Jan 2006, 4:30 PM local time.
