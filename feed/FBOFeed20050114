Further, approaches to develop the future intellectual capital and workforce necessary to respond to the challenges raised in this BAA should be broadly integrated across all lines of research.

<DESC>The Department of the Treasury’s Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD) on behalf of the Office Of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) intends to negotiate a sole-source procurement with Fleishman Hillard, Inc. for the acquisition of a Corporate Outreach Program in conjunction with the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign. 


The National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign also referred to herein as the Campaign, is run by the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP). The Campaign is a national social marketing effort that uses paid advertising in a variety of media as well as non-advertising activities to prevent initiation of use among youth as well as to stop occasional use of illegal substances among youth.  The Campaign is designed to reach two primary targets: (2) youth aged 12-18 with 14-16 year olds as the primary youth focus and (2) parents or other adult caregivers of youth aged 12-18.  

In FY 05 the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign proposed the reduction of the requirement for corporate participation and sponsorship conducted by the non-advertising contractor.  Congress opposed the reduction and specifically directed ONDCP to re-institute the corporate outreach program as it previously operated. This work was previously performed by the non-advertising contractor.

The Corporate Outreach Program Component shall leverage both high-potential corporate partners and low-investment activities that can be integrated effectively and efficiently with existing and planned Campaign activities.  Corporate participation should focus on supporting Campaign objectives, such as delivering specific youth and adult messages, distributing materials and driving audiences to Campaign Web sites.  

The corporate outreach program shall engage corporations in support of existing Campaign initiatives, particularly the Campaign’s workplace outreach effort called Parents@Work, as well as planned media events, interactive projects and partnership efforts with other sectors including parenting groups, non-profits, youth-serving organizations and entertainment entities.  This effort requires a high-level of management and coordination with Campaign staff, Partnership for a Drug Free America, the advertising Contractor, the non-advertising Contractor, the evaluation Contractor and various experts and partners to optimize Campaign resources and achieve the goal of reducing drug use among youth.

The Corporate outreach program needs to contribute to the Campaign goals, including:

Increasing the percentage of parents who report monitoring teenage children in three of four specific ways; Decreasing the percentage of 10th graders who report use of marijuana in the past thirty days; Increasing the percentage of youth ages 12-18 who believe there is great risk of harm from regular marijuana use; Decreasing the percentage of youth ages 12-18 who report intentions to use marijuana in the next 12 months; Increasing the percentage of parents who report intentions to know what their child is doing away from home.



NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT IS AVAILABLE.  The Bureau of the Public Debt will consider all affirmative responses received no later than 15 days after publication of this notice.   Affirmative responses shall be accompanied by sufficient technical detail and documentation to clearly show the ability to provide the requirement or functional equivalent, at terms more advantageous to the Government.  A request for documentation will not be considered an affirmative response.  If no affirmative written response is received that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all requirements and that it is more advantageous to the Government, we intend to negotiate a sole-source award to Fleishman-Hillard Inc. 1615 L Street NW Suite 1000 Washington, DC 20036.

Interested parties are requested to submit responses electronically to Gina Hanna at ntprocurement@bpd.treas.gov.   Or, responses may be addressed to:  Gina Hanna, Bureau of the Public Debt, Division of Procurement, 200 Third Street, UNB 4, Parkersburg, WV 26101.

This includes past and present customers and their current and former employees; past and present subcontractors and their current and former employees; current and former employees of the firm; federal, state and local government agencies (including court records), and private consumer protection organizations.  Offerors are strongly encouraged to provide information on problems encountered on identified contracts and annotate the firm’s corrective action taken.  The Government will evaluate past performance information and will rate the firms as pass or fail. In the event that a firm does not have a record of relevant past performance, or information on past performance is not available, the firm will not be evaluated favorable or unfavorably on this technical evaluation factor. Rather the offeror will be given a neutral rating. 

In accordance with FAR clause 252.215-1, Instructions to Offerors-Competitive Acquisition (MAR 2001), the Government will award after evaluations are completed, unless the Contracting Officer determines that discussions are necessary.

This plan is not required with the submission of the SF 254s and SF 255s, but an acceptable subcontracting plan must be agreed upon prior to contract award to any large business.  After the basic contracts have been awarded, a specific project will be awarded as a task order under the basic contract to the most highly qualified firm as determined by the A-E Evaluation Board using the selection criteria listed above.  Additional information may be required at that time from the A-E’s awarded a contract to ensure the most highly qualified firm is selected.  Additional information relative to the above specific projects is not available and requests for same will not be considered.  Site visits will not be arranged during the submittal period.  Primary NAIC is 541330 and 541310 but other NAICs in the Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services may be applicable for a specific project.

<DESC>The Library of Congress intends to issue a solicitation,
RFP# LC05R7500, for the FEDLINK Books and Library Publications
Acquisitions Program. This Request for Proposals (RFP)is for
services from vendors who can supply books and library publications(non-serial publications)and associated acquisition support services to federal libraries,information centers, and other federal offices. The services of serials subscription agents and the acquisition of commercial online electronic resources are covered under separate LC/FEDLINK solicitations and are not the subject of this solicitation. The RFP is divided into
four lots which define four different but related aspects of
books and library publications acquisitions: LOT 1 - Firm Order
Services; LOT 2 - Approval Plan Services; LOT 3 - Leasing Plan
Service; and LOT 4 - Technical and/or Order Processing Services.
VENDORS MUST QUALIFY UNDER LOT 1 IN ORDER TO PROVIDE SERVICES
UNDER LOT 2, LOT 3, OR LOT 4. LOT 1 is the core of this solicitation. LOT 1 -- Firm Order Services covers firm orders; a one-time order for a specific title (or specific titles) and number of copies, in contrast to a subscription or standing order.
Under LOT 2, -- Approval Plans, a vendor automatically supplies
materials potentially required by a library as they are published,
based on a detailed profile of the library's collection needs.
The library may return any publications deemed unsuitable for
addition to the collection and is only billed for items retained.
In LOT 3, -- Leasing Plan Services, the customer leases publications from the supplier instead of buying them, and retains an option to purchase leased items at a reduced price when the term of the lease is over. In LOT 4 -- Technical and/or Order Processing Services, the vendor may provide technical processing for materials supplied under this solicitation, performing physical processing or cataloging in order to supply materials to the customer in shelf-ready condition. The vendor may provide a computer-based order processing system for the customer to make the acquisitions control process more efficient. Multiple awards are anticipated. ALL REQUESTS MUST BE SUBMITTED IN WRITING. NO TELEPHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED. All written requests must contain an email return address; requestors will be notified by email of the RFPs release. All requests must reference RFP# LC05R7500 in the subject line. The solicitation, RFP# LC05R7500, will be available for downloading from the World-Wide Web on or about February 17, 2005.

This requirement is for a five-year  Indefinite                                  Delivery-Indefinite Quantity contract consisting of two                          base years  and three one-year options.  This requirement is                     for the repair of various  items that support the AH-1W and                      UH-1N aircraft.  The quantity shown above is  an estimate of                     the five-year repair requirement of the Transmission                             Assembly. In addition to this item, there are also 26 other                      items to be repaired under  this proposed contract.  Due to                      the extensive repair qualification process  required to                          demonstrate repair capabilities, only Bell Helicopter                            Textron will  be solicited since they are currently the only                     qualified source of repair. Any other interested sources                         should contact the NAVICP Source Development  Group at                           (215)697-1236 for information regarding technical                                qualification for  future requirements.  Other items with                        estimated quantities to be repaired for  the five year                           period include but are not limited to the following:                             012567681 199 ea., 012568371  268 ea., 013021006  587 ea.,                       013058172  119 ea., 014437090   109 ea., 014178146  158 ea.,                     014115215  1,388 ea., 014437060  80 ea.,  014172165  116                         ea., 010839447  405 ea., 014086574  75 ea., 001737439  477                       ea., See Notes 22,26*****

<DESC>The objective of this procurement is to obtain a wide range of services for performing munitions response and incidental environmental remediation at sites which potentially contain munitions and explosives of concern (MEC).  The purpose of the work is to allow for the reasonably safe use of the identified areas of concern.  Work at the areas of concern may be on or beneath the surface of land areas, and may include beach, marsh, mud flats, surf zone and/or submerged water areas.  The Contractor may be required to perform work at multiple sites worldwide.  The work will primarily be in Alaska, Washington State, and Hawaii but may include other sites at Navy and Marine Corps installations, and other Government agencies in the United States and its territories and worldwide.  The exact location of the individual efforts will be designated on individual Contract Task Orders.  The contract will be Cost-Plus-Award-Fee (CPAF), Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (ID/IQ) type contract, with a ceiling of $50 million.  Projects may be of significantly varying types and magnitude.  The work may require capability to perform large-scale multiple projects simultaneously, and ability to mobilize for significant and unexpected surge requirements on short-notice.  The workload is subject to uncertainty and workload fluctuations may be significant and unexpected throughout the period of the contract.  The contract term will be a base period and four one-year option periods.  THIS IS A TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.  THE NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE IS 562910, Environmental Remediation Services.  Small business size standard is 500 employees.  This is a source selection procurement requiring both technical and cost/price proposals.

<DESC>NOTICE OF CONTRACT ACTION FOR THE QUINT NETWORKING TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM (QNT).   QNT is a modular network data link program focused on providing a multi-band modular capability to close the seams between five nodes - Aircraft, UCAV, Weapons, tactical UAV and dismounted ground forces.  The specific intended QNT hardware users are weapons, air control forces on the ground (dismounted) and tactical UAV’s.  These three are the focal points of the QNT effort with the other two elements using hardware and waveforms from established programs.  The assumption is these other two types of platforms provide a starting point for building capability for the other three elements. The objective of the QNT program is to design, develop, evaluate and demonstrate robust, affordable data link technologies suitable for use by weapons, tactical unmanned air vehicles (UAV’s), and dismounted ground units. A draft of the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) providing more details into this program is attached hereto.  Comments from Industry and Academia concerning any of the technical description as described in the DRAFT BAA solicitation for this program are welcomed.  Any and all comments are requested to be submitted to both Dawn Ross at dawn.ross@wpafb.af.mil and Michele White at michelle.white@eglin.af.mil by no later than 18 Jan 05, 3:00 pm local time.  The final BAA is anticipated to be released by 20 Jan 05 and will be available at  www.fedbizopps.gov.  These proposals are anticipated to have a expected due date of 28 Feb 05. Other business opportunities for the Air Force Research Laboratory are also available at www.fedbizopps.gov. Direct questions to the Contracting point of contact identified in the announcement.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541990   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) intends to award a sole source fixed-price Purchase Order using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Thompson, Inc. of Philadelphia, PA. The purpose of this acquisition is to obtain citation analysis services for several EPA research programs.  The reports generated by this analysis will provide evidentiary information for independent expert program reviews of EPA programs scheduled for the 3rd quarter of this fiscal year.  This  effort is a follow-on to a recently completed acquisition that Thompson, Inc. provided the citation services.  ORD presently needs further analysis and Thompson has the unique qualifications to perform the needed services under the current compressed schedule. It has been determined that Thompson's  expertise and historical background providing citation services with EPA makes them the most cost effective, and uniquely qualified vendor to meet this requirement. NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE. Notwithstanding, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting EPA's  requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which if received by the response date of this announcement will be considered. Responses to this posting must be in writing. A determination not to compete the proposed Purchase Order based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the  discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The DACP Program is managed through Deputy Under Secretary of Defense Advanced Systems and Concepts (AS&C), Comparative Testing Office. DACP provides any person or activity within or outside the DoD the opportunity  to propose alternative technologies and product improvements. Opportunities known as Challenge Proposals, proposed at the component, subsystem, or system level of an existing DoD acquisition program, will be evaluated for resulting improvements in perform ance, affordability, manufacturability, or operational capability of that acquisition program. DACP Proposals will be evaluated under the guidelines outlined in Title 10 USC, 2359b, Defense Acquisition Challenge Program. This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is open to any of the below listed technologies, products, or processes demonstrating a near- term potential to improve existing DoD acquisition programs. Preference will be given to those technologies and products that have the potential to be evaluated in less than 24 months from project selection, with near-immediate transition to operations/pro duction at the completion of evaluation.

The evaluation of proposals will be conducted in two phases. In the FIRST PHASE, any person or activity within or outside the DoD interested in participating must submit a Defense Acquisition Challenge Program Proposal along with a Quad Chart, using the mo st current templates provided on the proposal submission website: http://bids.acqcenter.com/dacp. All proposals received will be subjected to competitive peer and scientific review. Evaluation criteria for selection include at a minimum: (A) whether the pr oposal has merit; (B) whether the proposal is likely to result in improvements in performance, affordability, manufacturability, or operational capability at the component, subsystem, or system level of an acquisition program; (C) whether the proposal coul d be implemented in the acquisition program rapidly, at an acceptable cost, and without unacceptable disruption to the acquisition program. Proposals that meet the requirements as outlined above, and any additional evaluation criteria deemed appropriate fo r source selection, will be prioritized based on potential for providing innovative and cost-saving technologies or products into existing Department of Defense acquisition programs and ability to meet warfighter needs. The acquisition program of record (P OR) that can be identified as the most likely to benefit from the proposed technology or product will be asked to conduct a review of the proposal submitted in this First Phase. Although not required in this first phase, a letter of support/endorsement fro m the DoD Program Management Office or Program Executive Office responsible for the acquisition program may be submitted in conjunction with the proposal. The associated DoD Program Manager, in collaboration with the prime system contractor on the program,  will decide whether to accept the proposal and further refine/develop the proposal. In the SECOND PHASE the PORs that have accepted the First Phase proposal will be extended an invitation to develop and submit a Second Phase Proposal in competition for DA CP funding used to test the proposed technology. The purpose of the Second Phase Proposal is for the sponsoring government program office to refine the First Phase prop osal addressing key performance parameters, preliminary test plan, cost analysis, funding required to test/evaluate the technology or product, the length of the evaluation period, and the program office plan to transition the technology or product to the f ield if it meets the programs requirements, etc. Proposals may request funding for test article acquisition, test and evaluation of the test article, appropriate vendor cost, integration costs, and some government program office costs. By law, DACP funds c annot be used to implement/field the technology or product. Persons, organizations, and government activities submitting DACP Proposals that meet the requirements as outlined above and are accepted by the acquisition program may be extended an invitation t o work with the DoD sponsor to submit a Final Proposal. The DACP Final Proposal will include: key performance parameters (those the technology/product/process must meet); test concept and schedule for the test planning, administration, and data analysis; a  plan for integration (to include cost and schedule) of the technology or product into the acquisition program; test article cost; Quad Chart and a Project Chart with cost profile for the test and evaluation of the technology/product/process for the intend ed application. The integration plan must include all applicable certifications (safety, flight worthiness, insensitive munitions, operational utility, etc.) required to insert the product/technology/process into the acquisition program. Letters of support  from the acquisition authority expressing intent to procure, or the weapon system prime expressing intent to incorporate, pending successful testing, are highly encouraged.  At the completion of the Second Phase a Government-led evaluation team will revie w all competing Proposals and assess each against the evaluation criteria set forth in Title 10, USC Section 2359b and those criteria deemed appropriate for source selection. The Second Phase Government review of the Proposals will include all criteria lis ted above, as well as: (A) an assessment of the cost, ease, and likelihood of adopting the challenge proposal and implementing it in the acquisition program; and (B) consideration of any intellectual property issues associated with the Challenge Proposal. Proposals will be selected for funding based on their assessment rating and the availability of Government funding. Selection for funding is highly competitive. Every attempt will be made to ensure that all submitters are notified of the outcome of their p roposal(s). Final FY2006 selections are expected to be finalized NLT 1 October, 2005. All submissions into the Defense Acquisition Challenge website must be UNCLASSIFIED. Classified submissions, up to SECRET, can be accepted through the mail. Classified re sponses must be appropriately marked, sealed and mailed in accordance with classified handling procedures. Classified proposals must adhere to the same Proposal and Quad Chart formats provided on the website. For classified submittals, send an email to def ensechallenge@osd.mil. Mailing instructions will be provided at that time. Classified documents must be mailed and received by the applicable due date and time. Classification does not in any way eliminate the offeror requirement to comply with all instruc tions in the BAA. Notification of rejections will be emailed to the Proposal submitter. It should be generally assumed that the reason a proposal was not considered for further review was due to failure to meet the requirements for DACP or limited funding availability. This should not be construed as a commitment by the Government, and any information submitted by industry will not constitute an offer that could be accepted by the Government to create a binding contract. The Government does not intend to aw ard a contract on the basis of this Request for Information or otherwise pay for the information solicited. Persons submitting proposals are advised that only t he Contracting Officer may obligate the government to any agreement involving expenditure of government funds. While this BAA and evaluation process meet the requirements for fair and open competition, the final determination will reside with the DoD contr acting officer from the Sponsoring organization. Proposals must be received/submitted via the DACP website NLT 2400 hours EST, 18 February 2005. Proposals submitted after the deadline will have to be submitted as an UNSOLICITED PROPOSAL and may result in t he proposal not being considered for funding during the initial selection cycle. All Proposal submissions must comply with the Submission Guidelines and use the FY2006 templates provided on the website. Failure to comply with the above instructions may res ult in the rejection of the proposal during the administrative review.

Should privatization prove to be economical, a firm will be selected to purchase and assume ownership of t he above-mentioned utility system.  The successful firm will be required to improve the present system to meet industry standards.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equi pment necessary to own, maintain, operate, repair/replace, and upgrade the utility system to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.

It is the vendor's responsibility to monitor FedBizOps for any changes and/or conditions.  The use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) is required in Federal solicitations as part of the bid submission process, thereby eliminating the need to submit a paper copy with each offer.

<DESC>This amendment is to revise RFP  HSBP1004R0247 by amending the following and to provide answers to questions:

1.	This contract has an existing union agreement.  The union agreement is made part of the RFP as attachment F.

2.	The SOW, attachment C has been amended and is replaced in its entirety.

3.	Attachment  B, Section B has been amended and replaced in its entirety.

4.	Block 9 of the SF33 is amended to add.    The current due date for the proposals is revised to February 15, 2005 at 3:00 PM.

5.	The cut off date for submitting questions is February 1, 2005 at 4:00 PM.



Questions concerning the RFP from various offeror’s.

1)     RFP Reference: RFP Attachment B, p. 5, Paragraph 1.7, and p. 16, Paragraph 1.13.4
 
RFP Question:  Reference is made to armed and unarmed guards and training requirements for both, yet RFP Attachment B, Attachment 3a, Guard Post Listing shows all posts as being armed. Which is correct? For pricing purposes, need to know which posts are armed and unarmed or is it the Government’s intention to use Guard II qualified individuals on all posts?

Answer : It is the government's intention to use Guard II qualified individuals on all posts.

2)     RFP Reference: RFP Attachment 3b- Post Order and Attachment 3c-CBP SOP
 
RFP Question:  These post orders do not match the post numbers, types of posts or post times that are listed in RFP Attachment B, Attachment 3a, Guard Post Listing. Which attachment has precedence?  Please clarify.  

Answer : The modification has corrected this issue. 
 
3)     RFP Reference: RFP Attachment B, p. 15, Paragraph 1.12.4.3, and RFP Attachment B, Attachment 2
 
RFP Question: Contractor is directed not to remove firearms and to store weapons “using an approved weapons storage method.” Are there currently storage areas? How many ? Does each building require a dedicated storage area or are some (NDC1-NDC 5) sharing one storage location?

Answer:  There is one storage location to service all sites.

4)     RFP Reference: RFP Attachment 6, Deduction Table, Item #5
 
RFP Question:   What is considered an “excessive” turnover rate and what is the amount of the deduction?

Answer: Excessive turnover rate as well as deduction amount are to be determined by the CO/COTR based on the circumstances.  The contractor will be allowed to participate in the discussion and present his/her case.
 
5)     RFP Reference: Delivery Schedule, CLIN 25, and RFP Attachment B, CLINs 25a and 25b
 
RFP Question: CLIN 025 in the Delivery Schedule is specified as a “Cost Reimbursement” item; Attachment B lists CLIN 25a as being “Other Direct Costs” (ODC) and CLIN 25b as “Transition Costs.” ODC normally covers travel and other miscellaneous items.  Does ODC apply to uniforms, firearms, and equipment? What does the Government allow to be included in CLIN 25b, 
Transition Costs? Does transition include recruiting, screening, training, recertification, etc.? Please clarify as it is critical to determine what costs might be eligible for cost reimbursement and which costs must be factored into G&A.

Answer : ODC covers special equipment and supplies, when required by the government, but does not cover standard-issue items such as uniforms and firearms.  ODC also does NOT cover costs relating to recruiting, screening, training, certifications/re-certifications, etc.

6)     RFP Reference: RFP p. 48, Section L.5, General Instructions for the Preparation of Proposals
 
RFP Question:  The numbering of the Technical Proposal Required Response Format on RFP p. 48 and RFP p. 49 appear to conflict. RFP p. 48 specifies three sections: Section 1-   Transmittal Letter; Section 2- Executive Summary and Table of Contents; and Section 3- Technical Approach.  Yet RFP p. 49 -50 list six required sections beginning with Section 1, Overall Approach; Section 2- Personnel Resources & Staffing, etc. Should the six requirements on RFP p. 49-50 be listed as Sections 4-9 on the outline? Please clarify.

Answer : There are 4 Main sections to each proposal: 1-Transmittal letter, 2-Ex.Summary and TOC, 3-Technical Approach, and 4-Offeror's Addedum.  Within Section 3, Technical Approach, there are 6 required sections, beginning with Overall Approach and ending with Transition Plan.
 
7)     RFP Reference: RFP p. 51, Section L.5, General Instructions for the Preparation of Proposals
 
RFP Question:: Is Section 4, Offeror’s Addendum actually Section 10 (see above question) on the required outline rather than Section 4?
 
Answered above. 

8)     RFP Reference: RFP p. 53, Section M.2, Technical Evaluation Factors
 
RFP Question:  Technical Plan (D) and Corporate Experience (E) are not specified in Section L required outline. Are these plans the same as the Contract Management Plan and Current/Past Performance specified on RFP p. 49? Or, should the contractor add them to the required outline to follow the Transition Plan? 
 
Answer : Technical Plan (Item D in Section M) will be evaluated based on the information provided in the Overall Approach (Section L, B, Section 3, Item 1), Subcontracts and Consulting Arrangements (L,B,3,5), and Transition Plan (L,B,3,6), as well as information provided in other sections as it relates the Technical Plan.

9)     RFP Reference: RFP p. 49, Section L5, General Instructions for the Preparation of Proposals
 
RFP Question:  Is the Contract Management Plan the same plan as the Management Plan specified on RFP p. 53 or a separate requirement? If a separate requirement, where should the contractor address it in the Section L Outline?

Answer : Contract Management Plan in Section L is the same as Management Plan in Section M.
 
10)     RFP Reference: RFP p. 49, Section L5, General Instructions for the Preparation of Proposals
 
RFP Question:  Is the Personnel Resources and Staffing Plan the same plan as the Staffing Plan specified on RFP p. 53 or a separate requirement? If a separate requirement, where should the contractor address it in the Section L Outline?
 
Answer : Yes, they are the same.

11)     RFP Reference: RFP p. 49-50, Section L5, General Instructions for the Preparation of Proposals
 
RFP Question:  Is the Current/Past Performance Section the same requirement as  Corporate Experience  (E) on RFP p. 53 or a separate requirement? If a separate requirement, where should the contractor address it in the Section L Outline?
 
Answer : Yes, they are the same.

12)     RFP Reference: RFP p. 53, Section M.2, Evaluation Criteria
 
RFP Question:  The Evaluation Criteria do not appear to match the required response items in Section L.5. For example, the Subcontracts and Consulting Agreements and Transition Plan described on RFP p. 50-51 are not part of the evaluation criteria. Please clarify.

Answered above.
 
13)     RFP Reference: RFP Attachment B, Paragraph 1.2.3, p. 3
 
RFP Question:  Here the Transition Plan is required 20 days after contract award, yet RFP p. 50, Section L.5, requires the transition plan with proposal submittal. Which is correct?

Answer: An initial Transition Plan describing the general approach to the taking over the contract from the incumbent is required with the proposal.  A more detailed Transition Plan, if needed, will be prepared by the contractor and provided to the government within 20 days of contract award.
 
14)     RFP Reference: RFP Attachment B, p. 2, Paragraph 1.1.2.14, and RFP Attachment B, p.22
 
RFP Question:  Reference is made to a QA Plan and Exhibits, and RFP Attachment B, p. 22 refers to Attachment 7 (Small and Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan) and Attachment 8 (QA Plan including Exhibits).  RFP Attachments 7 and 8 were not provided. Please provide
 
Answer: The original attachment 7 referring the Small Business was removed without references to it being removed.  The current Attachment 7 used to be Attachment 8 and should have been referred to as Training Plan rather than QA Plan.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command Simulation and Training Technology Center (formerly STRICOM) publicized Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) N61339-01-R-0023 in the CBD on 01 March 2001.  This notice calls for White Paper Submissions in reference to the research interest entitled, 7.0 “Additional Research Topics, LVC-IA Joint Seamless Interoperable Training Environment.”   The Technical Point of Contact for this specific white paper submission: Mr. Mark Jozwiak, PEO STRI, PM FF (S), (407) 384-3729, mark.jozwiak@us.army.mil (email contact preferred). The Contractual Point of Contact:  Ms. Gloria Bailey, NAVAIR Orlando TSD, Code 25343.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES:
The objective of the Live, Virtual, Constructive Integrated Architecture (LVC-IA) program is to create a Joint, Integrated LVC environment & capability that allows Army forces to routinely train/operate in the Contemporary Operating Environment (COE) / Joint Operating Environment (JOE) as part of a Joint Task Force (JTF).  

The objective LVC-IA is to:  1.  Implement a standardized set of protocols, specifications, and standards that permit interoperability and integration among Army & Joint LVC components. 
2.  Provide an integrated LVC environment that ensures compatibility and interoperability for all TADSS and fully embeds into Future Force Battle Command System, while linking to and stimulating Joint Command and Control (JC2) systems.  3.  Provide “Plug and Train” capability to support operations, mission planning-rehearsal, on demand, anytime, and anywhere, while training in a Joint context.  4.  Permits interoperability and integration among- a.  Joint Family of Simulations (JFOM)(JNTC Efforts). b.  Common Training Instrumentation Architecture (CTIA).  c.  Synthetic Environment (SE) Core. d.  Army Constructive Training Federation (ACTF). e.  Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA). f.  Other Potential LVC components (FCS FoS, WIN-T…).  g.  Embeds into and stimulates JC2.

PROGRAM SCOPE:
The required research is for the development of the LVC-IA Technology Development Strategy (TDS) and technical direction for the LVC-IA base program Analysis of Alternatives (AoA).  The acquisition framework for the base LVC-IA program incorporates a Technology Development Phase focused on the development, maturation, and evaluation of the technologies needed for the capability under consideration.  This phase of activities concentrate on maturing those technologies (consistent with recommended Technology Readiness Levels) and demonstrating readiness to proceed with program initiation. This document is developed during the Concept Refinement phase for the base LVC-IA program to support the program’s Milestone A decision.  The TDS outlines the plan for conducting the Technology Development phase, to include:  a.) Rationale for adopting an evolutionary or single-step-to-full-capability strategy; description of how the program will be divided into technology spirals and development increments tied to the AoA. b.) Cost, schedule and performance goals for the total R&D program; and specific goals and test plans for the first technology spiral synchronized with the AoA finding.

 The TDS is done concurrently and simultaneously with the LVC-IA base program AoA. This AoA is an analysis of the operational effectiveness and estimated life cycle costs for alternative materiel systems required to meet or eliminate identified gaps and shortfalls in the existing operational capabilities. During this TDS effort, in conjunction with AoA, you will provide the technical direction for the future LVC Integrated Architecture. Your technical recommendations will be required to assist TRADOC (TRAC WSMR & NSC) and the PEO with the AoA analysis and evaluation of a range of specific hardware and software alternatives identified in the Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) and to focus on how to provide the needed capabilities while reducing cost and risk. Additionally, the AoA provides information and data to document rationale for adopting an evolutionary or single-step strategy with cost, schedule and performance goals for the total R&D program and specific goals and test plans for the first technology spiral, which will assist in the development of the recommended technology development strategy.  The AoA and TDS should provide independent assessment of the final results and document these results in the following key AoA assessment categories: 1. Important Aspects of the Study Plan Followed.  a. Deviations from the planned effectiveness and cost analyses are understood and documented to conform to AoA study plan standards. b.  Address how oversight guidance and all appropriate issues were addressed. c.  Study Plan has been updated over the course of the study. d.  Purpose and tasking were appropriate for the study. 2.  Scenarios Appropriate and Approved.  a.  Address training scenario validation and approval. b.  Scenarios used were appropriate, providing reasonable results. c.  Army and Joint architectures have been considered for impact. 3.  Models, Simulations and Accreditation Reasonable. a.  Accreditation report covering models and data certification signed. b.  Models, simulation and data worked appropriately. c.  Identify models and simulation shortfall; include workarounds. 4.  Final Operational Concepts Are Reasonable. a.  Have the user sanction employment concepts (basing, deployment, doctrine, and other limitations, etc.) been identified? b.  Verify the viability of logistics concepts (maintenance, supply, personnel, etc.). c.  Account for interdependencies with existing operational live, virtual and constructive systems and key support systems (navigation, communications, weather, etc.). 5.  Effectiveness Methodology Successfully Executed. a.  Determine the military worth of alternatives to the user. b.  Discuss effectiveness assumptions. c.  Follow a logical and reasonable analysis approach. d.  Evaluate a range of independent alternatives for the final analysis. f.  Give a convincing rationale for early elimination of alternatives. 6.  Cost Analysis Methodology Successfully Executed. a.  Discuss costing assumptions. b.  Identify sources for cost inputs. c.  Summarize the cost review process. d.  Present cost results by alternative. e.  Discuss CAIV implications. 7.  Presentation of Final Results Support the AoA Findings.  a.  Discuss the ability of the cost-effectiveness comparison methodology to differentiate among alternatives. b.  Outline decision criteria and its impact in making the final selection.  c.  Present cost-effectiveness comparison results at the MOE level and at higher levels of aggregation if appropriate. d.  Present clear and reasonable results. e.  Present and interpret sensitivity analyses addressing the threats, alternative performance, etc. f.  Identify and interpret methodology shortcomings relative to each alternative. g.  All AoA conclusions are supported with briefed results? 
TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT STRATEGTY:
The TDS at a minimum contains the following items: a.  Planned acquisition approach, including a summary of the considerations and rationale supporting the chosen approach.” To Spiral develop the Army’s LVC Integrating Architecture by leveraging the existing Army and DoD programs into a joint, seamless, interoperable Training Environment that approximates the Warfighter’s Operational Environment.” b.  For the preferred, evolutionary acquisition approach, whether spiral or incremental, DoD Instruction 5000.2 requires the following details- I.  A preliminary description of how the program will be divided into technology spirals and development increments; II.  The limitation on the number of prototype units that may be produced and deployed during technology development; III.  How prototype units will be supported; IV.  Specific performance goals and exit criteria that must be met before exceeding the number of prototypes that may be produced under the research and development program. b.  A discussion of the planned strategy to manage research and development. This discussion must include and briefly describe the overall cost, schedule, and performance goals for the total research and development program. To the extent practicable, the total research and development program should include all planned technology spirals or increments. c.  A complete description of the first technology demonstration. The description must contain specific cost, schedule, and performance goals, including exit criteria, for the first technology spiral demonstration. d.  A test plan. A description of how the first technology spiral demonstration will be evaluated to determine whether the goals and exit criteria for the Technology Development phase have been achieved. The test plan is focused on the evaluation of the technologies being matured during the Technology Development phase. This plan is distinct from the separately developed and approved Test and Evaluation Strategy discussed in detail in section 9.6.1 of the Defense Acquisition Guidebook. The Test and Evaluation Strategy takes a broader view and is the tool used to begin developing the entire program test and evaluation strategy, including the initial test and evaluation concepts for Technology Development, System Development and Demonstration, and beyond.

The Request for Information is hereby amended to make editorial changes; Question marks are hereby deleted.

This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.   THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS IT IS FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.  

The National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) is requesting information from Contractors on robust, high repetition rate pulsed laser pumps for production of maximally entangled photon pairs by Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC).  

Submissions addressing available information/technology, or adaptations thereof, as well as technical comments on pumps meeting some or all of the specifications identified herein are being requested.  Submissions shall include, but are not limited to, product literature, technical data, and/or adaptation schemes.  Information on the Contractors experience in building the same or similar equipment, and the proposed availability of equipment is also requested.  

Contractors shall identify their business size, (small, small-disadvantaged, hub-zone, large etc.) in accordance with North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing; the Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees.  If the equipment is manufactured by other than the respondent, please provide business size information on the manufacturer as well.

Responses to this notice must be sent to the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Acquisition Management Division, Attn: Carol A. Wood, Contract Specialist, 100 Bureau Drive, Mail Stop 1640, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-1640.  Submission must be received by 3:00 p.m. local time on January 31, 2005.

Original submissions are required.

Specifications for a Pulsed Laser as an Entangled Photon Source Pump NIST has a need for robust high repetition rate pulsed laser pumps for production of maximally-entangled photon pairs by Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC).  There are two distinct entangled photon pair wavelength ranges of interest.  With this and respecting that summed energies of the SPDC photon pair must equal the energy of the pump photon, constraints on corresponding pump wavelengths are determined.

The first range of interest permits optimal detection of polarization-entangled photons through the atmosphere with a Si Avalanche Photodiode (APD).  Si APD has near-peak detection efficiency in the range of 550-810 nm and the preferred atmospheric transmission range is 740-810 nm (peaking at 770 nm).  The desired pump wavelength range is 310-410 nm, with the understanding that resulting SPDC wavelengths should avoid several atmospheric absorption lines in the range mentioned above (see fig 5 of Nordholt, Jane E., Richard J. Hughes, George L. Morgan, Charles G. Peterson, Christopher C. Wipf “Present and Future Free-Space Quantum Key Distribution” Free-Space Laser Communication Technologies XIV, G. Stephen Mecherle, Editor, Proceedings of SPIE Vol. 4635 (2002), pp 115-126, LA-UR-01-6817). Thus at least one of the down-converted photon pair must be within the preferred atmospheric transmission window (740-810 nm) and the other photon should be in the Si APD detection window (550-810 nm).   Pumps for degenerate entangled photon pairs are preferred (both within 740-810 nm range).  

The other range of interest corresponds to production of time-bin entangled pairs at the telecom wavelength of 1310 nm.  Allowable ranges are approximately 1280 to 1330 nm, and thus corresponding permissible pump ranges are 640 to 665 nm.  For example, a 655 nm pump would produce degenerate 1310 nm photon pairs.

Nondegenerate SPDC generation with one photon near the 1310-nm telecom wavelength is also acceptable.  An entangled pair consisting of a photon in the 1280-1330 nm range and a photon in the Si APD detection range can be produced using a pump wavelength in the range of 385-500 nm.  Although alternative solutions are not precluded, particular attention will be given to diode and fiber based constructions. 

NISTs requirements for these pump lasers are as follows:

Average power/Pulse energy  we require a minimum of 500 mw of average power; within the 10 MHz to 1 GHz repetition rate range requirement, we prefer higher energy per pulse with a goal of 50 nJ/pulse;

Laser wavelength fixed in the range of 310 to 410 nm (first priority) or 385 to 500 nm or 640 to 665 nm (second priority);

Laser bandwidth less than/equal to 0.05 nm;

Wavelength stability/tolerance less than 10% of 0.05 nm;

Spatial mode a minimum of 500 mW in TEM00 (this is defined as the amount of power that can be coupled into a single mode fiber.); 

Pulse duration less than or equal to 0.5 ns;

Rep rate greater than or equal to 10 MHz;

Duty factor less than or equal to 10% (this becomes a factor for rep rates above 200 MHz);

Power stability fluctuations less than or equal to 5%;

Pointing stability fluctuations less than or equal to 10% of beam divergence;

Polarization purity/ stability greater than 100:1;

Timing jitter with respect to trigger less than 10% of pulse duration;

Physical size compactness desirable, entire system including electronics must fit in a standard 19    inch instrument rack ca. volumes of 18 inches x 24 inches x 3.5 inches or 18 inches x 9 inches x 10inches power consumption less than 10 W target (100 W max) wall-socket power;

System can employ harmonic generation to generate pump wavelengths;

Turnkey system operation, no user serviceable parts;

Output may be fiber pigtailed.

NIST is most interested in pump technology that promises straightforward extension to both the atmospheric (Si Detection) and telecom interests.  In the absence of a system meeting both needs, the Si detection application is preferred.

<DESC>THE RESPONSE DUE DATE IS HEREBY EXTENDED TO 1/21/05. 
This sources sought announcement for the U.S. Census Bureau, Geography Division is seeking information on businesses capable of providing services to continue the ongoing development and maintenance of the Puerto Rico Master Address File (MAF).  

THIS SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT COMMITTED TO AWARD A CONTRACT PURSUANT TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.   

The applicable NAICS code is 541360 and the Size Standard is $4 million annual receipt for the preceding three fiscal years. Responses to this announcement are solicited to identify Puerto Rico addressing services and to determine the commercial market pricing structure for these services.     
Any information provided is strictly FOR INFORMATION ONLY to assist the Census Bureau with formulating and determining the magnitude of a specific requirement for the Geography Division. Contractors should be capable of providing the following requirements: 

On a six-month cycle, the U.S. Census Bureau, Geography Division requires an updated/ maintained Puerto Rico MAF file in support of its mission of improving the outcome of the 2010 Decennial Census Operation. The Census Bureau's expectation for new address records (representing newly constructed residential units- single family housing, individual apts, townhouse etc.) is approximately 16000 records per year (approx. 8000 adds per six-month delivery.  

In addition, the Census Bureau will provide 2 to 3,000(6000/year) new address records each cycle for processing and maintenance to the Puerto Rico MAF.

To achieve the expected outcome, the contractor should be able to perform the following tasks/subtasks:

Task Requirements

To accomplish the purpose of this requirement the contractor shall provide the following:

1.	Update and Maintain the Puerto Rico Master Address File (PR MAF) 
2.	Address Problem Resolution Support
3.	Puerto Rico MAF-Decennial Census- Optional Requirement

To achieve the expected outcome, the contractor shall perform the following subtasks:

Update and Maintain the Puerto Rico Master Address File (PR MAF)

		Address Geocoding (Residential)- Activity 1

The contractor shall provide general-purpose geocoding service to meet the needs of the Puerto Rico Community Survey and the 2010 Decennial Census.  

Field presence across Puerto Rico may be required to accurately geocode new addresses (to assign a census level block code) as well as obtain access to local knowledge about planned or recently completed residential subdivisions.

		Address Standardization/Parsing – Activity 2

The Census Bureau requires a standardizing and parsing service for new or updated address records.

		Address Matching- Activity 3

The contractor shall match the PR MAF to the DSF on a 6-month cycle.  The matching service shall also provide for exact and equivocated matching of address lists (compiled in the field by Census Bureau representatives) to the PR MAF.  
The contractor shall correct existing addresses in the MAF or identify new addresses and/or addresses that could possibly be missing from the PR MAF.

	Address Classification- Activity 4 

The contractor shall classify all Puerto Rico address records as mailable and non-mailable in order to support the Geography Division with adequate planning and conducting Census Bureau operations such as the Puerto Rico Community Survey and the 2010 Decennial Census.  

The contractor shall analyze the results of the PR MAF to the Delivery Sequence File (DSF) match, and classify each address record as one of the following:

Deliverability Flag  
1.  Exact DSF Match - The PR MAF address exactly matches with a DSF address, down to the ZIP+4 level.

2.  Equivocated DSF Match - The PR MAF address matches with a DSF address, but some of the address information is not an exact match.  For example, the ZIP+4 codes do not match.

3.  No DSF Match Potentially Deliverable - The PR MAF address contains all of the necessary components for mailing (including 5 digit ZIP) but the address could not be matched to a DSF address and delivery cannot be guaranteed.

4.  Undeliverable - The PR MAF address is not mailable because it is missing critical delivery information, or it only contains a location description.

5.  PO Box - The PR MAF mailing address is a post office (PO) box address.

6. Previously Matched - The address doesn’t match the current DSF, but matched to one or more previous DSFs.  

Addressing Conversions and New address Updates Activity 5

The contractor shall identify the most recent address conversion areas and the addresses associated with the new residential units   across Puerto Rico through field presence and access to local knowledge about planned or recently completed residential subdivisions.

		Assignment of Pre-defined Algorithm Codes- Activity 7

The contractor shall assign a pre-defined algorithm code to each new or revised address record. The Census Bureau will provide the algorithm codes and the associated logic for setting each code.

Address Problem Resolution Support- Activity 8

The contractor shall provide “Consultation services” that will likely involve conference calls or government site meetings as needed. The consulting services will assist the Geography Division in its effort to move towards self-sufficiency in processing, maintaining and utilizing addresses in the Puerto Rico Master Address File.  Census Bureau staff will schedule calls or onsite meetings with as little as a week notification.


The Census Bureau will supply:

<SUBJECT>58--Counter Remote Control Improvised Explosive Device (RCIED) Electronic Warfare (CREW) Spiral 2 (CREW-2)
<SOLNBR>W15P7T05RS502
<RESPDATE>022005
<ARCHDATE>04212005
<CONTACT>Meghan Mele, 732-532-8299
<DESC>Counter Remote Control Improvised Explosive Device (RCIED) Electronic Warfare (CREW) Spiral 2 (CREW-2) is a competitive acquisition for the award of a Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Firm Fixed Price (FFP) production and Time & Materia ls (T&M) contract. The Government may elect to award a single delivery order contract or a multiple delivery order contract to a second source.  The planned first production run is 500 units and the guaranteed minimum quantity of the planned IDIQ contract is 100 units to be delivered no later than 270 DAC, FOB origin.  However, the planned first production order is anticipated to be 675 Spiral 2 CREW systems delivered in the late FY05 timeframe.  Additional production units at planned quantities of 2025 uni ts and 1800 units are expected to be priced and available for ordering through FY07.   A provision for a higher quantity (surge capacity) of units up to 10,000 (total ceiling) will be made available on the IDIQ ordering arrangement through FY09. Award(s) w ill be made as a BEST VALUE determination, made to the best overall proposal that is determined to be the most beneficial to the Government.   The acquisition of the Spiral 2 CREW system will be a full and open competition, with offerors submitting proposals based on the Government defined Statement of Objectives (SOO) and Performance Based Specification (PBS). The Spiral 2 CREW evaluation will b e accomplished using formal source selection policies and procedures.   The MNC-I Operational Needs Statement (ONS) addresses the Iraqi theater and focuses principally on vehicular mounted Counter RCIED.  These systems must be capable of providing adequate protective Electronic Bubble for vehicles, dismounted operations in c onjunction with vehicles and for fixed sites.  These counter threat device designs, that may be proposed, must consider currently known and anticipated future RCIEDs.  They must be capable of providing coverage over the broad frequency range of high and lo w power threats.  The Spiral 2 CREW systems must achieve interoperability and synchronized operations with Blue Force Communications and other fielded ECM Devices.  The systems must conform to the limited vehicle power constraint of 12/24 Volts.  The syste ms must be environmentally rugged and be waterproof, dust proof and operate in temperatures of 20-150 degrees Fahrenheit.  The systems must provide a field test scanner for pre-operational checks and be extremely user friendly for on the fly regional softw are load changes by soldiers.  The systems must be easily installed and easily maintained and supported in a wartime environment.    Recognizing the adaptive nature of the threat and the need to provide rapid capabilities to the field, the Spiral 2 performance objectives are expressed in terms of improvement and expanded performance over the current Spiral 1 Warlock systems.  A Spiral 2  performance specification will be used for this acquisition.  The goal oriented performance specification gives industry the greatest latitude possible in design solutions that meet the Spiral 2 requirements.  The Government will identify the threats that  must be defeated and offerors must demonstrate defeat capabilities with a prototype in a laboratory and subsequent open field test during the source selection phase.  The two demonstrations (laboratory test and field test) of equipment performance during source selection in conjunction with a full technical and cost proposal evaluation will determine which offeror provides the best value solution to the Government.  The challenges to industry are as follows: -Produce/field a universal one system that addresses the full spectrum of  RCIED threats -Deliver increased performance in frequency coverage and minimum  protective radius distance -Design a system that provides flexibility for future capability growth -Provide a common training and supportability approach -Achieve SWAP improvements -Provide adequate  production facilities to meet schedule and surge capacity needs -Balance performance & sustainment needs with an affordable solution The governments minimum requirement is as follows: Freq Spectrum (xMHz  yMHz) Simultaneous Threats x# Effective Range x Meters Physical Parameters (SWAP) Tactical Applications Programmability Modes of Operation Indicators and Switches Remote Control Box Platform Integration Antenna Pattern Coverage Reliability (MTBF) Interoperability  Comm Systems Interoperability  Counter RCIED Environmentals Built-in-Test (BIT) Field Test Set Zeroize Function Anti-Tamper Safety

<DESC>This Federal Business Opportunity Announcement is notice that the TRICARE Region 6, 7 & 8 which includes 46 Military Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, Nebra ska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Texas, South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming are initiating a standardization review for the product line of HAND SANITIZERS.  The intent of this standardization is to establish regionally preferred sources for hospital supp ly items and to standardize purchasing of these products for the MTFs.  Additional TRICARE Regions may elect to join after the award.  Clinical Product Teams (CPT) will evaluate this product line.  CPTs are composed of Physicians, Nurses, Medical Technicia ns, Infection Control Officers, and other clinicians who have expertise and knowledge of the products.

THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE.     The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD intends to procure airframe Depot level maintenance for the Navy and Marine C-9B/DC-9 aircraft. The DC9s are slated for retirement and will require only limited maintenance, such as drop-ins and field teams. The Navy and Marines currently operate 17 C-9Bs and 4 DC9s worldwide. These aircraft are an off-the-shelf version of the commercial DC-9 aircraft and differ slightly from the rest of commercial DC-9 fleet due to Navy unique modifications. Parts, material, Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) maintenance documentation, manuals, and necessary OEM engineering source data are commercially available. However, there may be the necessity to maintain a licensing agreement with the OEM. The prime contractor and subcontractors must be Aircraft Repair Station licensed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) under Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part 145 to participate in this effort. The primary performance objective is to provide the aircraft depot maintenance services necessary to meet the C-9B/DC-9 aircraft operational requirements. This also includes field team maintenance that occurs away from the Contractors designated depot facility, via Contractor Field Teams or Contractor selected Subcontractors and Vendors. The contract type will be a requirements type contract with no minimum or maximum ordering requirements due to the uncertain number and timing of aircraft retirements. Contact information is as follows: mail to Department of the Navy, Naval Air Systems Command, RADM William A. Moffett Building, Attn:     Jason Lev, CODE:     2.4.3.1.1, 47123 Buse Road, Bldg, 2272, Patuxent River, MD 20670-1607 OR via email at jason.lev@navy.mil.     Electronic responses are preferred.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce/NOAA/National Weather Service/Radar Operations Center under the Authority of 41 USC 253(c)(1),  intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with DRS Weather Systems the current contractor  for the review and implementation of changes to the Evansville, IN dopplar radar source code necessitated by Government software changes.  The incumbent contractor designed and supplied a commercial off the shelf (COTS) radar.    As the design agent the incumbent contractor developed the necessary software and maintains the only documented source code therefore,  is the only source who could successfully complete the software upgrades determined by the Government for the dopplar radars including the Evansville radar unit.

The mission of the Evansville radar is to supply usable weather radar data and interface this data to the NWS network of dopplar radars.   As technology is infused into the NWS network by the Government and software changes are made (software builds) the Evansville radar source code must be reviewed and altered if necessary to maintain seamless data transfer with the NWS. This action is imperative to enable the delivered radar to maintain connectivity to the NWS network.  The knowledge of the system and access to the software allows only the incumbent contractor to institute the required system alterations of software and hardware without the need to reverse engineer the system.  

This is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, interested companies may submit an affirmative response to the requirement within 15 days from the posting date of this notice to Mark.A.Miller @noaa.gov or FAX to 301-713-0806.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. No telephone requests will be honored.    If the decision is made to negotiate with solely the named firm, no further announcement will be made prior to award.

<DESC>The United States Coast Guard, Maintenance and Logistics Command, Atlantic is seeking sources that can provided the following services for a prototype engine overhaul/modification of a single diesel engine on a 140’ WTGB Icebreaking tugboat located at Sault St. Marie, MI.  Overhaul/Modification will be done at the vessels homepier in Sault St. Marie, MI.  Unit Exchange/Reconditioning.  Services being requested are: (1) Evaluate the existing diesel engine’s salient features, to include the operating conditions, conditions of the existing machinery, review of the available service records of the engine, and the application of OEM and after-market components.  (2) Install exchange or rebuilt fuel injection pumps to produce a change to the existing injection timing of the engine to achieve higher exhaust temps at lower engine loads.  (3) Install an external motor-driven vacuum fan to ensure that the engine remains under proper vacuum irrespective of engine speed.  (4) Install an air-operated, PLC controlled, temperature control valve in the engine’s jacket water system.  The valve will be configured to regulate jacket water temperature based on existing lube oil temperature.  (5) Install a PLC control panel to control the above mentioned control valve as well as the existing air by-pass actuator for the installed blower.  (6)  Install a  crankshaft air seal to reduce lost crankcase vacuum.  (7) Calibrate the existing Lube Oil Sump bayonet gage to ensure it complies with engine OEM Service Bulletin, Volume “A”, Issue 12, dated June 22, 1987.  (8) Perform an inspection of the engine’s existing vertical drive shaft assembly and provide a report on the condition of the components relative to the OEM tech manual.  (9) Perform an inspection of the engine’s existing roots blower and provide a report on the condition of the components relative to the EOM tech manual.  The inspection shall include the conduct of an air test.  (10) Perform an inspection of the engine’s existing gear train at the free end of the engine and provide a report on the condition of the components relative to the OEM tech manual.  This upgrade/overhaul is a prototype modification that will address documented concerns associated with light load operation, while maintaining optimum high icebreaking steady state and transient performance.  The light load concerns include excessive oil injection into the exhaust manifolds and piping.  Excessive exhaust oil injection also leads to the cutter’s topside surfaces getting coated with a slippery film of oil.  The oil injection is also an environmental concern, whether carried directly into the sea, or into the bilge.  The second primary low load concern is high smoke opacity.  The prototype upgrade/overhaul goals are intended to demonstrate a Fairbanks Morse Engines proprietary modification approach that will successfully address the low load concerns, while maintaining optimum icebreaking steady state and transient load performance.  The USCG does not have access to the proprietary baseline design data (as-built drawings) required to formulate the necessary modification to allow the engine to operate in a different manner.  The engine is a unique opposed piston design.  One of the environmental concerns associated with the 140’ WTGB MSA main engine design decision is whether a modified Fairbanks Morse 8-38D8-1/8 engine will have to meet Environmental Protection Agency Tier 2 exhaust emission requirements.  There may be vendors that can repair and tune the FBM diesel, but as a result of these unique design characteristics, it is believed that only the OEM, Fairbanks Morse Engine Division, possesses the design criteria, historical expertise, and technical ability to develop a new load-carrying profile for this engine.  The desired outcome of the engine modification should allow the vessel to operate safely and environmentally compliant at lower vessel speeds associated with new DHS Law Enforcement duties.  Any other business sources, able to provide the above listed parts and services are encouraged to respond to this announcement within 10 days of its publication.  Interested firms should submit in writing, its name, address, point of contact, telephone number, business size and a brief statement regarding it capability to provide the services and experience working on this type of engine.  Firms must provide how they have access to the proprietary information to perform the modification.  The information should be submitted to the address stated herein or may be faxed to telephone number 757-628-4676, ATTN:  Lisa Dieli.  The small business size standard is less than 1000 employees and the NAICS Code is 333618.  This is not a request for proposals and there is no solicitation.  All responsible sources may respond.

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Boulder City Regional Office, Boulder City, Nevada, intends to award on a sole source basis , a purchase order to Advanced Resource Management, 308 East Simpson St., Lafayette, CO 80026-2326.  This purchase order is for continued research and writing for all interpretive media produced in conjunction with Exhibit Statement of Work for Hoover Dam Visitor Center, Boulder City, NV.  Mr. Rich Smith of Advanced Resource Management (ARM) was part of the planning team that created the Master Plan for Hoover Dam Visitor Center and Grounds.  He completed the research and writing for the first 12 signs to be placed on the observation deck and interior rotunda of the Hoover Dam Visitor Center.  His intimate and superior knowledge of this project make him particularly well suited for this project since he has already completed initial research and writing about the topics to be included in the remainder of the interpretive media for this site.  Furthermore, the geographic location of his office adds significantly to the efficiency, coordination, and collaboration of the project team and reduces costs associated with travel and expenses related to project team meetings.  Mr. Rich has completed the first two phases of research and writing for this project as evidenced in the successful completion of a previous purchase order.  Interrupting progress on this work at this stage with this contractor would result in significant loss to the Government.  It is considered to be in the best interest of the Government to award a purchase order to Advanced Resource Management.  This procurement will be awarded using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The anticipated award date is January 24, 2005.

<SUBJECT>A--Quantum Information Sciences BAA 04-20-MT, Amendment 02, Original FedBizOps Solicitation number : DOI-SNOTE-040804-001, dated 4 Aug 2004,  as modified 19 Aug 2004.
<DESC>General Information         Document Type:  Addendum to Special Notice        Solicitation Number:  DOI-SNOTE-040804-01        Description:  Modularly-configurable Multi-zone Ion Trap Technology (MMITT)       PROGRAM OBJECTIVES: A specific new task has been identified under the major area of interest of Quantum Computing:  There is interest in research and development to production of a standard modularly-configurable multi-zone ion trap technology that would be readily and economically available to researchers in the field of ion trap computing technology.  The main objective of developing MMITT technology is to eliminate the substantial trap fabrication, testing and calibration effort (often about 1 experimenter year) generally required by researchers (who must currently design, fabricate and test a new trap before they can proceed to the specific R&D tasks of their interest).  Furthermore, there is also interest in integrated-design modular subsystems to support the ion traps in terms of control electronics, lasers for cooling and logic gate operations, magnetic field sources and shielding, vacuum bake-out aids and procedures, detectors, and other subsystems that enable ion trap researchers to proceed more efficiently to specific R&D studies.  (For further information about these interests, see 'Specifications for a "test ion trap" for qubit manipulation', David Wineland, et. al., December 22, 2004, at http://webteam.nbc.gov/pmb/nbc/qisbaa.html).  There is particular interest in ion trap and subsystem technology that is expandable from several ionic qubits to 1-2 hundreds of such qubits as research in this field progresses.  Respondents to this addendum should indicate a plan for interacting with the ion trap researchers and evolving the design to higher levels of integration as needed.  In particular, due to the combination of requirements and technical specialties needed to accomplish this task, a small team must probably be developed and held together over several years to evolve the design and fabrication technology as the experimenters' needs evolve.  Respondents should also indicate how they might commercialize delivery of ion traps to experimenters who are not part of ARDA's program.      PROPOSAL SUBMISSION AND DEADLINES Awards for this addendum are anticipated about April 1, 2005.  Proposals will be due no later than March 15, 2005. Hence, respondents are encouraged to submit Initial Contact Papers as soon as is feasible.

A contractor asked whether a new Shuttle Staging Area would mean a change in routes, and a decrease in the number of cashiers.  The NPS indicated, no, to both questions.  The NPS indicated that there would still be two locations required for the sale of shuttle passes.  The NPS noted that the reason for the changes in the Shuttle Staging Area is due to the future expiration of a lease that the NPS has for the current Shuttle Staging Area.  Future Amendment:  The NPS indicated that there would be a small change in the description of the possible locations for the future Shuttle Staging Area. 40.  Section C-17.  A NPS comment was made that it is the contractor's responsibility to fuel their buses.  A NPS comment was made that there are no fueling facilities located inside of the Park. 41.  Section C-5.

<SUBJECT>84 -- Follow-up - FPI's T-Shirt Production in FY 2003
<DESC>On July 26, 2004, Federal Prison Industries, Inc. (FPI), published a notice in the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) regarding overproduction of t-shirts.  The notice advised that during the preparation of the Fiscal Year (FY) 2003 Sales Report, FPI management staff noted that t-shirt production had exceeded the Board of Directors approved units for that fiscal year.  
	The July 26th notice stated that FPI has produced t-shirts at its facility at FCI Jesup since the 1980s.  In 1995, FPI began screen printing t-shirts for the Air Force at FCI Jesup.  FPI received the fully manufactured t-shirts from a private vendor, screen printed them, and forwarded the t-shirts to the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) for the Air Force.  The vendor is a member of the American Apparel and Footwear Association (AAFA) and a DSCP-qualified vendor.  During FY 2003, FPI was informed that the vendor making the fabric and cutting the t-shirts had suspended domestic production operations and had begun sending the cut pieces to Mexico to be sewn.  FPI advised DoD of this situation and DoD directed FPI to discontinue the purchase of the t-shirts produced outside of the U.S.  In an effort to comply with DSCP’s request and continue fulfilling the contract, the local Jesup factory subsequently began to make the t-shirts in-house with domestically purchased fabric, provided by the same vendor.  This action resulted in FPI inadvertently exceeding its Board approved production level in FY 2003 for manufacture of t-shirts by 230,000 units.  The Board approved sales level was not exceeded.  FPI therefore requested retroactive approval from the Board of this overage in unit production of t-shirts in FY 2003.  
	FPI received comments in response to the July 26th notice from three interested parties, including two private companies that have previously been suppliers to DSCP and the principal trade association representing the industry, the AAFA.  The three parties noted three basic areas of concern.  First, they expressed objections to FPI inadvertently exceeding its Board approved production level in t-shirts for FY 2003.  Second, in their perception, FPI has an unfair advantage because they believe FPI does not have to bid for contracts like other private vendors.  Third, noncompliance of the law under the Berry Amendment was not considered a sufficient reason to increase production levels.  FPI forwarded all of the comments, in their entirety, to its Board.  
	In response to the first comment, the t-shirts in question were not counted in the production levels or sales for sewn t-shirts in FY 2003 because originally FPI had purchased the t-shirts from a private vendor.  FPI then performed the screen printing of the t-shirts for the Air Force, per the contract.  The screen printing service was reflected in FPI sales.  Following FY 2003, the t-shirts that were sewn and screen printed by FPI were reflected in FPI sales and production figures for t-shirts. 
	In response to the second comment, FPI, along with the private sector, has been a longstanding supplier to DoD for a portion of their requirements.  FPI, by statute, is not authorized to take more than a reasonable share of the market.  FPI’s overall share of apparel production for DSCP needs is approximately 8.0 percent.  Moreover, FPI’s mandatory status with DoD has been modified with the implementation of Sections 811 and 819 of the Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 2002 and 2003.  Sections 811 and 819 require DoD to conduct market research before purchasing FPI products.  The research determines whether the FPI product is comparable in price, quality, and time of delivery to products available from the private sector.  If the FPI product is not comparable to the private sector, DoD must use competitive procedures to acquire the product.  Therefore, no awards from DoD are guaranteed.  In addition, screen printing is a service and FPI’s mandatory source has never applied to services.  
	In response to the third comment, upon notification that the private vendor making the t-shirts was sending them to Mexico to be sewn, FPI stopped using the non-American made t-shirts.  In an effort to solve the problem expeditiously, not be delinquent on shipments, and find a way to comply with the contract and the Berry Amendment, FPI produced the shirts from cut parts, inadvertently exceeding the production guidelines for t-shirts.
	It was the official decision of the Board to ratify FPI’s overproduction of t-shirts in FY 2003.  FPI and the Board agreed to implement the following corrective actions to prevent future production oversights.  	
	1.	FPI will assure that all future applicable contract language will include a reference to the Berry Amendment, so that a similar situation does not recur.
	2.	Board approval will be required on future production levels.
	3.	FPI will work with the customer to determine the need for future actions. 
	4.	The Board and FPI will continue to consult with AAFA on this and other matters in an effort to promote and maintain ongoing and productive dialogue and open communication.     
	Interested parties have a right to raise questions at any time with FPI’s Board of Directors.  Any correspondence should be addressed to: Chief Administrative Officer, Research, Activation, and Corporate Support, Federal Prison Industries, Inc., 320 First Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20534.

<DESC>Description:  Special Notice Subject: Improvised Explosive Device (IED) Active Protection Systems As part of DoDs continuing efforts to accelerate the development of systems to protect our warfighters in Iraq and elsewhere, the Department is request ing that U.S. industry, laboratories, and inventors generate as many creative ideas as possible to counter the improvised explosive device (IED) threat.  IEDs are one of the most lethal threats encountered by our brave young men and women in Iraq and Afgha nistan.  Even as the Department is rushing to provide additional add-on armor for vehicles to help our soldiers survive an IED attack, for now and in the future, it is more effective to detect and defeat an IED before it has a chance to detonate.  Last year, the Department established the Joint IED Defeat Task Force consisting of members of the Department and other government agencies to take a holistic approach to defeating the IED threat.  The Task Force is working to combine synergistic affects o f non-conventional solutions, tactics, techniques, and procedures that increase the safety of our coalition forces in theater.  A Technical Support Working Group and numerous government agencies are supporting the Task Force initiatives.  On or around 1 February 2005, the Joint IED Task Force plans to release another Broad Area Announcement that seeks solutions from industry partners to defeat the IED threat.  Specific information will be released in the Broad Area Announcement.  Current an d prospective industry partners should survey the Requests for Solicitations at the following web sites: https://www.bids.tswg.gov or www.fedbizopps.gov.  Use key word searches such as IED Defeat.  I encourage all industry to review the Broad Area Announcements when they are published in early 2005 on the FedBizOpps and Technical Support Working Group Bids portals.  If you feel you have ideas that are responsive to those requirements, please submit a  proposal  in accordance with those announcements.  THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. NO SOLICITATION OR STATEMENT OF WORK IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. DO NOT SUBMIT PROPOSALS IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  The Point-of-Contact for this announcement is Ms. Jenness Simler, 703-697-9956.  Secondary POC is Mr. Ben Riley, 703-602-0683.

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to address potential offerors questions.

Question 1:  The specifications list a 100 Ft. Retractable Tower.  Please advise if you prefer either of the following:
A)  A Rigid Telescoping Steel Grid Tower Assembly that can be climbed in the upright position, with Work Platform at the top. 
B)  A Telescoping Air Inflatable Mast Assembly that cannot be climbed in the upright position, with Work Platform at the bottom. 

Answer to Question 1: The tower will not be climbed in the upright position.  An air inflatable mast is not feasible.

Question 2:  Please advise the approximate Cross Sectional Area of the Antenna Equipment so that we can properly size the outrigger, ground stabilizer, and Guy Wire System.

Answer to Question 2: The size of the 500 pound mast top payload can be approximated by going to http://heron.nrl.navy.mil/contracts/RFP/05jk02amend02spec.pdf.

Question 3:  Under "Additional Requirements" in the Specifications, #10 states, "System must be equipped with a night vision goggle (NVG) compatible aviation obstruction lighting subsystem, including all required cabling and electrical connections,"  Please provide clarification/specifications/requirements for "night vision goggle compatible lighting subsystem."  Does this system require special hardware, lights, wiring, etc?

<CONTACT>Cheryl Hampton, 703-693-2144
<DESC>Questions and responses to Solicitation Number W74V8H-05-R-0015 appear below: Question 1.   Are outreach efforts to be done by the contractor or by OASD staff supported by the contractor? Response:  The contractor has primary responsibility.  OASD staff expects that the firm who is selected for this contract will have the knowledge necessary and contacts to support the outreach efforts.  The firm awarded this contract will need to advise th e Government, provide analyses and strategies, and conduct outreach efforts in support and/or on behalf of Government personnel.  Question 2.  Can OASD provide the types of labor categories and number of hours per category needed for support? Response:  The offeror will propose the labor mix deemed most appropriate.  However, the government estimates that approximately 1,000 hours of effort is involved.  Fifty percent of this effort is for expert regulatory analyses and support, and fifty perce nt of the effort is for planning, strategy, and outreach efforts. Question 3.  Does the lead candidate have to have the TSS by contract start or can this be in-process of being done? Response:  Top Secret SCI clearance must be current and active on the date of contract award so that performance can immediately commence. Question 4.  Is this effort for follow-on to an existing contract and contract number? Response:  The types of services being sought under this contract are similar to those performed under a prior contract that expired in November of 2004. Question 5.  Does OASD want a cost estimate just for labor support or should the estimate also include the cost of other direct costs in support of events? Response: The level of detail for your proposal should be consistent with your normal pricing procedures for services of this type, and should include all necessary overhead and other direct costs necessary to support this effort.  You should also include an amount for travel expenses.  You should expect an average of  3 one-week trips overseas during each year of the contract. Question 6.  Will OASD provide Government furnished equipment and supplies? Response:  The Government will not supply any equipment or supplies related to this contract. Question 7.  Can OASD provide an estimate on the number of training events per year, and possible average number of attendees? Response:  An average of 3 moderate (30 people) events and one large event (300 people) should be anticipated each year.  Events can be conferences or training sessions and each event will not exceed one week in duration. Question 8.  Can OASD provide an estimate on the number of outreach events to be supported per year? Response:  Outreach activities include strategies, material, and contacts.  It is a year round activity.  Specific outreach events include those described in the statement of work, as well as conferences and training sessions.
