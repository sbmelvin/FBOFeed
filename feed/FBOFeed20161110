<p>BAA NUMBER: FA8750-17-S-7001</p>
<p>CATALOG OF FEDERAL DOMESTIC ASSISTANCE (CFDA) Number: 12.800 &amp; 12.910</p>
<p><strong>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</strong></p>
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory is soliciting white papers under this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for research, development, integration, test and evaluation of technologies/techniques to advance the technology and/or increase the knowledge, understanding and capability of cyber operations technologies that can address current Department of Defense (DoD) gaps in operational asymmetric campaigns and force protection capabilities through rapid prototyping efforts. This includes integration research into technology and approaches to better equip the warfighter. Concepts at the intersection of the areas of Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Electronic Warfare (EW) and Cyber Operations technologies are sought in this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). Development proposals, specifically as applies to new ideas/concepts for practical application, are of interest.</p>
<p>Research efforts under this program are expected to result in experimental capabilities, concepts, theory, and applications addressing cyber operations problems and asymmetric threats to support the future needs of units including 1st Air Force - AFNORTH, 24th Air Force, 25th Air Force, Air Force Global Strike Command, Air Force Security Forces Center, and other government agencies.</p>
<p>Projects specializing in highly novel, interesting, and applicable techniques will also be considered if deemed to be of "breakthrough" quality and importance. The effectiveness of the developed technologies for potential operational use will be assessed through preplanned testing and evaluation activities. Rapid prototyping of technologies that can be transitioned for operational use are of high interest, and will be assessed for transition through other contract vehicles; <strong>this BAA is for the research and development phases.</strong> Offerors are encouraged to describe the pre-conditions and assumptions that are necessary for the proposed techniques to work effectively.</p>
<p>Broad topics of interest include: maturing, integrating, and testing C2 and detection capabilities of unmanned aircraft systems; developing new and applying currently available cyber operations technologies for use in airborne and ground platforms; developing technologies to better equip the warfighter for force and materiel protection operations; automatic decision making and enabling autonomy in cyberspace operations; developing concepts and capabilities that intersect the areas of SIGINT, EW and Cyber for asymmetric force applications; and developing big data analytics methods for asymmetric for non-traditional technologies and weapon systems. As stated above, breakthrough research will be considered outside these focus areas if compatible with BAA goals.</p>

<p><strong>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</strong></p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are of equal importance and will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Overall Scientific and Technical Merit - The soundness of approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. The potential contributions of the effort to the U.S. Air Force Cyber Asymmetric Force Applications for Unmanned Aircraft Systems mission, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge including experience and qualification of the types of personnel proposed and the quantity and quality of the offeror's experience relevant to the requirements. This include an understanding of Air Force and/or Joint cyber operations, and SIGINT/EW tools, platforms, and processes,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Openness, Maturity and Assurance of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology, and <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e. Reasonableness and Realism of Proposed Costs and Fees (if any).</p>
<p>No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:</p>
<p>Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>3. ADEQUATE PRICE COMPETITION: The Government may simultaneously evaluate proposals received under this BAA with a common cutoff date for multiple offerors. In this case, the Government may make award based on adequate price competition, and offerors must be aware that there is a possibility of non-selection due to a proposal of similar but higher-priced technical approach as compared to another offeror.</p>
<p>4. FEDERAL AWARDEE PERFORMANCE AND INTEGRITY INFORMATION SYSTEM (FAPIIS) PUBLIC ACCESS: As required by 2 CFR 200 of the Uniform Guidance and FAR 9.104-6, the Government is required to review and consider any information about the applicant that is in the FAPIIS before making any award in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold (currently $150,000) over the period of performance. An applicant may review and comment on any information about itself that a federal awarding agency previously entered. The Government will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in FAPIIS in making a judgment about the applicant's integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 2 CFR &sect; 200.205 Federal Awarding Agency Review of Risk Posed by Applicants.</p>
<p><strong>VI. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">STEP TWO</span> INFORMATION - REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL &amp; AWARD:</strong></p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the TPOC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>

<p>3. DATA RIGHTS:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. SBIR RIGHTS. The potential for inclusion of Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or data rights other than unlimited on awards is recognized. In accordance with (IAW) the Small Business Administration (SBA) SBIR Policy Directive, Section 8(b), SBIR data rights clauses are non-negotiable and must not be the subject of negotiations pertaining to an award, or diminished or removed during award administration. Issuance of an award will not be made conditional based on forfeit of data rights. If the SBIR awardee wishes to transfer its SBIR data rights to the Air Force or to a third party, it must do so in writing under a separate agreement. A decision by the awardee to relinquish, transfer, or modify in any way its SBIR data rights must be made without pressure or coercion by the agency or any other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. NON-SBIR RIGHTS. Non-SBIR data rights less than unlimited will be evaluated and negotiated on a case-by-case basis. Government Purpose Rights are anticipated for data developed with DoD-reimbursed Independent Research and Development (IR&amp;D) funding.</p>
<p>4. REPORTING: <br />a. Contract Applicable: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be given complete instructions on the submission process for the reports. <br />b.

This applies to NFEs that receive federal awards (currently active grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts) greater than $10,000,000 for any period of time during the period of performance of an award/project.</p>
<p>5. NOTICE: The following provisions* apply:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) FAR 52.209-11, Representation by Corporations Regarding Delinquent Tax Liability or a Felony Conviction under any Federal Law <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) DFARS 252.239-7017, Notice of Supply Chain Risk <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) DFARS 252.204-7008, Compliance with Safeguarding Covered Defense Information Controls <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d) DFARS 252.203-7996, Prohibition on Contracting with Entities that Requirement Certain Internal Confidentiality Agreements-Representation<br />* Please note that the current versions or deviations of the related clauses will be included in any resulting contract.</p>

<CONTACT>Leslie D. Jones, Phone 7704882042, Email jxy6@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP), intends to award a sole source contract to Thomson Reuters (Scientific) LLC, 1500 Spring Garden St., #4, Philadelphia, PA, 19130-4067 for the purchase of a system containing all manuscripts submitted, author information, reviewer information and publication meta data.<br /><br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 519130, Internet Publishing and Broadcasting and Web Search Portals. The period of performance for this procurement is 60 months.
<p><br />Preventing Chronic Disease (PCD) started using ScholarOne's Manuscript Central in 2006. This system contains all manuscripts submitted, author information, reviewer information and publication meta data. The system has been specifically customized to meet the work requirements of the PCD workflow.</p>
<p>The currently functioning system supporting the management of manuscripts submitted to PCD is a proprietary system. No other offeror has the level of access required to perform the tasks outlined in the scope of work.</p>
<p>Manuscript Central is currently used by PCD and has been customized for the journals specific workflow. Any other product would require substantial resources in terms of time and start up costs for customization and likely not be able to meet all the current functionality of Manuscript Central as currently configured. Furthermore no other system would be compatible as all the historical data would at risk of not being accessible. The lack of access to our existing data would negatively impact the ability of the journal to carry out its mission. Poor performance of the journal will reflect poorly on the scientific quality and integrity of the Agency.</p>
<p>This system is mission critical for the functioning of the journal. Any lapse in service will have substantial negative impact on the continued operations of PCD and will not be able to continue to successfully achieve our mission and service to the approximately 47000 subscribers. Development and configuration of a new system would require an extensive reconfiguration, substantial time and resources and would not result in the best interest of the government. At CDC, both EID and PCD are current users ScholarOne, and MMWR is in the process of exploring the same, so that all 3 journals may be able to use the same system and consolidate the license agreement under a single reduced rate.<br /><br />Given the extent of the required customization, there are no comparable commercially available products that can perform the functionality currently required by PCD and that is being performed by Manuscript Central. The requirements of the system require access and ability to maintain an existing manuscript submission and management system. The existing customized system is proprietary and no other vendor can offer the expertise and access required to maintain this system.</p>
<p>As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to Thomson Reuters (Scientific) LLC. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide the services to Leslie Jones via email ONLY at jxy6@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 2017-Q-66152 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN November 25, 2016. <br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>Sole source Long Term Contract (LTC) with Federal Group 28, For OEM General Electric system(s). Solicitation number SPM4A210R0001-01.
<p>This agency proposes to add multiple NSNs from multiple FSCs to an existing long-term strategic/sole source contract. A total of 93 NSNs are currently targeted for this contract effort. These items have been identified as sole source. However, some items may have history showing awards to other than the OEM.</p>
<p>The proposed action is intended to be awarded on a sole source basis to General Electric at CAGEs 07482 and/or 99207. The proposed items are intended for addition to existing sole source contract SPE4AX12D9422 under award to General Electric, CAGEs: 07482 &amp; 99207 (IAW FAR 6.302-1). This is a Requirements Type Contract<br />with approximately five (5) years remaining. The contract requires supply of parts as well as other functions including but not<br />limited to inventory management, forecasting, distribution, storage, reliability improvements, engineering<br />maintenance, and design (control) affecting these parts. Subcontracting opportunities do exist for this effort.<br />Letters expressing interest in subcontracting provided to the contracting officer will be forwarded to the identified<br />OEM.</p>
<p>A letter RFP will be issued to satisfy this action. The attached list of NSNs is the items for this current action. If<br />other NSNs are subsequently added, as defined by the terms of the contract, they will be synopsized separately.</p>
<p>Responses to this announcement from other than the OEM are required by close of business December 26, 2016<br />and should identify items of interest and include evidence of ability to supply the items for the contract period as<br />identified. A copy of the letter of interest should be forwarded to the contracting officer identified herein and the<br />SBA PCR Michael Massello (michael.massello@sba.gov).</p>
<p>Surplus dealers, small business dealers and distributors (having on-hand existing stock of surplus or newly<br />manufactured material) are invited to respond to this synopsis. The response should include a completed surplus<br />certificate, DLAD 52.211-9000, Government Surplus Material or adequate traceability documentation to show that<br />the product is acceptable. In addition, respondents should identify quantity available and price. The government<br />may procure material or alter the acquisition strategy if purchase of existing surplus or newly-manufactured<br />inventory is in the best interest of the Government.</p>

They do not illustrate potential program growth or reductions which are also a part of the requirement. AQD is a Federal Franchise Fund Contracting Office within the Department of the Interior. AQD provides contracting support to all Federal and DoD Agencies under the authority of the Government Management Reform Act.
<p>AQD intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for confidential non-medical counseling services to military service members and their families, through the Military &amp; Family Life Counseling (MFLC) program. The MFLC program is one of the most critically important and highly visible programs within the DoD community.</p>
<p>Counseling services shall be delivered in person at or near participating duty stations and nearby civilian communities. Counseling services are currently provided at 223 locations in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, U.S. territories and commonwealths, and 17 foreign countries. Counselors provide face-to-face, worldwide support through rotational, surge or on-demand assignments. The PWS defines these assignment types.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall have and maintain a worldwide deployable network of counselors available for immediate assignment, sufficient to meet the Government's requirement for counselors described in the draft Footprints as well as a network to provide additional counselors based on the growth of the program. For performance locations within the Continental United States (CONUS), travel costs shall not be reimbursed. For performance locations outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) travel, approval and reimbursement shall be in accordance with the GSA Federal Travel Regulations and Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 31.205-46. Local travel mileage will not be reimbursed for CONUS and OCONUS assignments. General &amp; Administrative (G&amp;A) expenses shall not be charged to travel.</p>
<p>This requirement is a performance-based, commercial item acquisition conducted under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items, FAR Part 15 - Contracting by Negotiation, and FAR Subpart 16.5 Indefinite-Delivery Contracts. In accordance with FAR Part 15, the Competitive Range may be limited for efficiency. As this acquisition is for the DoD, the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation as well as all applicable DoD policies and procedures apply to this acquisition.</p>
<p>The RFP is for the potential award of multiple award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract(s) with the flexibility to issue task orders on a firm-fixed price, labor-hour or time &amp; materials basis. As the materials; hence Other Direct Costs are repetitive and routine in nature, the Government anticipates that G&amp;A expenses shall not be added to the cost. The Government reserves the right to make a single contract award if deemed to be in the best interest of the Government after evaluating proposals.</p>
<p>The anticipated period of performance for the IDIQ(s) or Task Orders may be a one-year or longer base period as well as a one-year or longer option periods which may equate to a 10-year period of performance. The total ceiling if single or multiple award IDIQ combined for a 5-year contract is $2.0 Billion or a 10-year contract is $4.0 Billion. In addition to the potential award of multiple award IDIQ contract(s), this competitive acquisition will also award the Task Orders necessary to fulfill all counselor requirements at time of contract award.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this requirement is 624190-Social Assistance-Other Individual and Family Services with a size standard of $11.0 Million. This acquisition is being competed as full and open competition on an unrestricted basis. All interested parties may submit a proposal. Offerors other than small businesses are required to submit a subcontracting plan in accordance with FAR 19.704 - Subcontracting Plan Requirements. The competitive RFP, amendments and all questions and answers related to this procurement will be made available via Federal Business Opportunities.</p>
<p>Potential offerors are responsible for accessing the solicitation when it is posted for response. Interested parties must respond to the solicitation in order to be considered for award of any resultant contract(s). There is no written solicitation document available at this time and when available will be posted on Federal Business Opportunities. Telephone requests for copies of the solicitation will not be honored and no bidders' list maintained.</p>
<p>The Government is providing a draft PWS for industry comment. The purpose of the draft is to afford industry an opportunity to comment on best practices and critical elements that may be included in the PWS. Any comments provided should not be viewed as a vehicle for presenting a specific approach to be proposed, but as an opportunity to improve an eventual solicitation package. The Government is in the process of finalizing the PWS and attempting to minimize questions prior to release of the RFP. The draft PWS is being provided solely for the purpose of industry comment and feedback. The attachments identified in the PWS are not being provided with the draft version. The draft footprints are being provided solely to allow industry to view the quantity of counselors and locations to afford a potential offeror an opportunity to determine if they are an interested party with the capacity to fulfill the magnitude of counselors required.</p>
<p>Also, for industry awareness, in regards to the evaluation of technical proposals, it is anticipated that the solicitation will include Go/No-Go evaluation factors. One of the Go/No-Go evaluation factors may include regarding if an offeror demonstrates providing both a nationwide and an overseas network of counselors available for immediate assignment as well as program growth along with the capacity for fluctuations which may include the addition of several hundred counselors. Another anticipated Go/No-Go evaluation factor is the offeror clearly demonstrates the mandatory credentials and qualifications for all counselors. If any of the Go/No-Go criteria are determined to be a No-Go, no further evaluation will occur and the proposal will be removed from the competition.</p>
<p>How to respond: Firms interested in providing feedback on the PWS only are due on or before 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time, on November 29, 2016 via email to D17PS00077@ibc.doi.gov with "Pre-Solicitation Notice - PWS Feedback" in the subject of the email. This does not constitute a solicitation and is not a commitment by the Government. The responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. The Government will not be providing a response to the feedback or questions directly, but may consider industry feedback/questions in possible revisions to the PWS. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement and any follow-up information requests.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The Government intends to enter into a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) contract with ALKAN, Rue du 8 Mai 1945, Valenton, France, CAGE F0554, in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, "only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements".</p>
<p>This proposed procurement is for the BRU-65 Ejector Rack Test Bench to include training, installation, and warranty support in accordance with the government statement of work. Solicitation will be issued for an anticipated Firm-Fixed Priced (FFP) contract. Delivery terms are 8 months after effective date of contract with F.O.B at destination. Inspection and acceptance are at destination. This will be a non-commercial acquisition in accordance with FAR Part 15.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one responsible source under the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. The basis for restricting competition is that the Government does not own the rights to the technical data package, duplicate cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and the unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency requirement through another source. Since this is a sole source procurement, a solicitation will not be posted to the internet. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>To be eligible for award, contractors must be properly registered in the System for Award Management (SAM). Offerors may obtain information on SAM registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 866-606-8220, or via the Internet at <a href="https://sam.gov">https://sam.gov</a>.</p>

<DESC>The United State Agency for International Development's Regional Development Mission for Asia (USAID/RDMA) anticipates the issuance of a Request for Proposal (RFP) for an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract with a ceiling of $70 million for the implementation of USAID Resilient Cities Asia. USAID intends to use full and open competition for this procurement and to release the solicitation within the first quarter of U.S. fiscal year 2017.<br /><br />This IDIQ contract will support secondary cities in Asia to become more resilient to a wide range of increasing climatic impacts by increasing their access to financing. The primary objective of this effort is to design, prioritize, finance and implement climate adaptation actions in support of secondary cities' resilience and development goals. This will be accomplished by helping Asia's secondary cities to evaluate, select, develop, finance, and implement climate resilience initiatives that can be funded and financed by various financial sources (e.g., from public and private, domestic and international). The secondary objective is to support the primary objective by helping selected cities to develop and implement policies, strategies, and related plans for climate resilience, based upon urban climate resilience principles.<br /><br />Assistance and services provided under the IDIQ will increase the capacity of secondary cities in the region to mitigate, adapt to, and recover from shocks and stresses caused by climate-induced events and stresses, and to transform themselves even with uncertainty and escalating climate risks. The services and assistance provided by this IDIQ will complement existing and planned efforts by USAID bilateral missions and other partners in Asia that help Asian secondary cities to become more resilient to the effects of climate change.<br /><br />Prospective Offerors are advised that this procurement is subject to internal USAID approvals and the availability of funds. This is NOT an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposals (RFP) and in no way obligates the United States Government to issue an RFP/IFB and/or award a contract. This notice satisfies the synopsis requirement in FAR 5.2. If a solicitation is issued, all necessary information will be supplied at the time it is posted at www.fedbizopps.gov.<br /><br />Interested parties are advised to periodically monitor the above website and solicitation number for updates concerning this procurement.

<p><br />Construction Project:<br />U.S. Army Corps of Engineers - Seattle District requires lifecycle maintenance on the 19 spillway gates at Chief Joseph Dam. The following is a brief description of the proposed project:</p>
<p>OVERVIEW: Chief Joseph Dam has 19 spillway gates measuring approximately 60 feet tall by 35 feet wide. The work described below will be accomplished on all 19 gates.</p>
<p>WIRE ROPE: Contractor will replace the two (2) assemblies (one on each side of each spillway gate) of stainless steel wire rope for all 19 spillway gates that are used to hoist the gates. Chief Joseph Dam will supply wire rope assemblies for eight (8) of the spillway gates, or a total of 16 assemblies of stainless steel wire rope. Contractor will furnish wire rope for remaining 11 gates, or 22 total assemblies, and any other equipment or material required to complete the work.</p>
<p>GATE SEALS: Contractor will furnish all material and equipment necessary for replacing the side and bottom seals on all 19 spillway gates including all seal hardware and gaskets.</p>
<p>SPILLWAY GATE RECOATING: Contractor will erect a containment structure within each spillway and sand blast the upstream side of all 19 spillway gates and recoat with specified paint types. Containment of debris structure erecting work is required to complete this task because of over the water work. Recoating work also includes miscellaneous weld repairs identified by the Government on the gates.</p>
<p>GEAR AND GEARBOX INSPECTIONS AND MACHINERY REHABILITATION: Contractor will partially disassemble spillway gate hoist machinery to inspect gears and gearboxes. Seals and bearings will be replaced in large gearboxes. Small gearboxes, couplings, and bearings will be replaced. Machinery and covers will be repainted.</p>
<p>SPILLWAY RAIL AND TROLLEY SYSTEM: (Design-build item) Contractor will design and fabricate rail system and trolley systems for 19 spillway gates. Anticipate 38 beams to compose rail system, two (2) motorized trolleys for moving Government-furnished hoists, and two (2) non-motorized hoists for fall restraint attachments. Design shall allow for easy removal and installation of trolley from one spillway gate to another.</p>
<p>CATHODIC PROTECTION: Install sacrificial anodes on 19 spillway gates. Work includes welding on connections and bolting on anodes.</p>
<p>SEAL HEATERS: Remove oil from and completely replace all non-embedded seal heater oil piping. This piping runs the length of the spillway, and heats the seals along every gate. Insulate all new piping. Furnish new valves, gauges, and fittings where necessary to match existing piping layout. Reuse existing pumps and heaters. Flush new systems as per typical commissioning requirements, and supply new fluid for systems. Anticipate a total of<br />600 gallons of seal heating oil in three (3) separate systems. In addition, fabricate pipe guards and oil catch pans.</p>
<p>WELD REPAIRS: Based on inspections, and as part of the spillway gate recoating process, weld repair work may be identified to repair damaged welds on the spillway gates. These repairs would be completed ahead of spillway gate recoating.</p>
<p><br />The magnitude of construction is estimated to be between $10,000,000 and $25,000,000. The resulting contract will be firm-fixed-price.</p>

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice (SBSS). This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small business; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br /><br />Background:
<p>The Agency for Healthcare Research Quality's (AHRQ) mission is to produce evidence to make health care safer, higher quality, more accessible, equitable, and affordable, and to work within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and with other partners to make sure that the evidence is understood and used. To achieve this mission, AHRQ conducts and supports a broad base of scientific research and promotion of improvements in clinical and health systems practices, including the prevention of diseases and other health conditions. AHRQ sponsors and conducts research that develops and presents evidence-based information on healthcare outcomes, quality, patient safety, cost, use and access.</p>
<p>Included in AHRQ's mandate is support of synthesis and dissemination of available scientific evidence, including dissemination research and analytic methods or systems for rating the strength of scientific evidence. The Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC) Program was created in 1997 to synthesize existing scientific literature about important health care topics and promote evidence-based practice and decision-making. These reviews use the research methodology of systematic review to systematically and critically appraise existing research and synthesize knowledge on a particular topic. The ultimate goal of EPC work is to present the "state of the science" on a given topic in a manner that can be directly applied to decisions made by users of health care information. These users include clinicians, patients, policy-makers, and payers, and may be individuals or their related organizations.</p>
<p>The John M. Eisenberg Clinical Decisions and Communications Science Center, also referred to as the Eisenberg Center (EC), takes a systematic approach to translate scientific knowledge into understandable, actionable language for all decision-makers. As scientific evidence about effectiveness is synthesized by the EPC program, the Eisenberg Center then translates the scientific knowledge into targeted products for stakeholders - including patients, providers, and policy-makers. As a part of the Eisenberg Center's role in interfacing with external stakeholders, they manage the Effective Health Care public-facing website (http://www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/). The Effective Health Care website is a public repository for EPC products, including systematic reviews, technical briefs, methods papers and methods guidance, and translation products based on EPC products; and houses the portal for nominations from the public for proposed systematic review topics and the public comment portals for EPC reports.</p>
<p>Additional information on the Effective Health Care program in general, resources it provides, and descriptions of processes can be found at: http://www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/index.cfm/what-is-the-effective-health-care-program1/.</p>
<p>Examples of products produced by the EPC Program may be found at: http://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/index.cfm/search-for-guides-reviews-and-reports/.</p>
<p>The Scientific Resource Center (SRC) was conceived in 2007 to promote efficiency, rigor, consistency, and quality across the Evidence-based Practice Centers (EPCs). The SRC supports the EPC Program through organizing and handling peer review of EPC reports; through organization and development of methodological papers, tools, and materials to promote consistency across EPCs; through development and maintenance of tools and opportunities to promote coordination, collaboration, and sharing of information; and through tracking and development of topics for review and update by the EPCs.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives:</p>
<p>The purpose of the proposed acquisition is to establish a Scientific Resource Center (SRC) to support the Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC) Program, an integral component of the Effective Health Care (EHC) Program.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of SRC work is to support the EPC Program and its aim to present the "state of the science" on a given topic in a manner that can be directly applied to decisions made by users of health care information.</p>
<p>The objectives of this proposed acquisition are: <br />1.	Coordinate methodological work to maintain utility, scientific rigor, and consistency of EPC products. <br />2.	Provide scientific and technical support to protect scientific credibility and independence of EPC Program Products<br />3.	Manage topic nomination development and selection processes (or "topic development"), and surveillance process.<br />4.	Maintain and update EPC program resources, including methods library, software such as ScholarOne, procedure documents and guidance tools, and mechanisms for collaboration and mutual learning.</p>
<p>Project Requirements:</p>
<p>The SRC will implement activities to meet the following requirements:</p>
<p>1. Coordinate methodological work to maintain utility, scientific rigor and consistency of EPC products.</p>
<p>&bull;	Engage EPC input on methodological priorities through assembly of and  communication with an EPC Methods Steering Group to identify areas of  methodological priorities for EPC workgroup projects in light of current EPC  resources and needs, external methodological efforts, and prioritize EPC  methodological efforts to improve quality and consistency of EPC products.</p>
<p>&bull;	Organize and provide logistics for methods work addressing areas as  determined by engagement with the EPC Methods Steering group.</p>
<p>&bull;	Convene two in-person 2 day meetings yearly to discuss coordination and  consistency of EPC products and methodological approaches. These meetings will  be held in the Washington DC or Rockville, MD areas.</p>
<p>2. Provide scientific and technical support to protect scientific credibility and independence of EPC Program Products.</p>
<p>&bull;	Manage and coordinate the independent scientific review of EPC products  through coordination, and training of associate editors (AE) for EPC products;  and quarterly calls with associate editors to improve consistency and efficiency  in AE review as well as identify areas for quality improvement within the  program.</p>
<p>&bull;	Manage Peer review using appropriate software, such as ScholarOne software.  The SRC shall maintain and refine peer review processes to enhance efficient  review of each EPC report.</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide data on timeliness of EPC product milestones for informational and  Program quality improvement purposes.</p>
<p>&bull;	Request information from stakeholders, including Supplemental Evidence and  Data for Systematic Reviews (SEADS) for EPC reports.</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure appropriate statistical review upon request of AHRQ contracting officer  representative in areas such as meta-analysis, network meta-analysis, or other  statistical methods such as qualitative comparative analysis.</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide methodological support to EPC authors such as searches of the FDA  site, clinicaltrials.gov site, or relevant registries or other data sources.</p>
<p>3. Manage topic nomination development and selection processes (or "topic development"), and surveillance process.</p>
<p>&bull;	Manage EPC Program Topic Selection process, from receipt of nominations  from the EPC Program website. This includes engaging stakeholders, including  those representing health systems in the nomination process; clarifying  nominations with stakeholders as needed; assessing each topic nomination  against prespecified selection criteria; soliciting input from a topic selection  group; managing the prioritization process of topic nomination and sharing  results on the EPC program Secure Site; finalizing documents that describe the  disposition and rationale ("topic briefs"); and providing feedback to the  nominator and public through email and public posting of the topic briefs on the  EHC Web Site.</p>
<p>&bull;	Select no more than 5 high-impact reports for surveillance and develop  assessments about the currency of those reports ("surveillance reports")  annually to be posted on the EHC Web Site.</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide transparency about the topic selection process through feedback to  nominators, posting of topic briefs on the EHC Website, and posting of  surveillance reports on the EHC Website.</p>
<p>4. Maintain and update EPC program resources and promote program collaboration and communication.</p>
<p>&bull;	Maintain a continuously updated library of methods articles relevant to the  conduct of systematic reviews and make the library available and accessible to  EPC investigators.</p>
<p>&bull;	Develop and maintain documents for EPC program including templates for the  Topic Briefs and Surveillance Reports, and templates and instructions for use of  peer review software such as Scholar One, SEAD and AE processes.</p>
<p>&bull;	Maintain databases for EPC program topics, peer reviewers, and stakeholders.  These searchable databases will be used for tracking and reporting.</p>
<p>&bull;	Support of EPC mutual learning through bi-monthly webinars focused on topics  related to EPC methods projects, methods guidance, or other topics.</p>
<p>&bull;	Maintain and keep up-to-date a secure EPC website for coordination of EPC  Program activities among the SRC, AHRQ, EPCs and the EC. This includes  technical support, maintenance and support for user login and passwords,  ensuring compliance with AHRQ and DHHS requirements for security and  privacy, and near full-time availability of the website.</p>
<p>&bull;	Document work by the SRC, including instruction and procedure documents for  tasks such as peer review, SEAD and other processes.</p>
<p>5. Conflicts of interest</p>
<p>Reliability and use of EPC review products may only be established if both the processes and individuals conducting the research maintain no conflicts of interest. The AHRQ EPC program separately provides guidance and oversight on the processes and individuals conducting EPC reviews. The SRC will also identify and manage conflicts of interest for SRC staff conducting work for AHRQ. The SRC shall also establish a formal conflict of interest mitigation plan for identifying, disclosing, and managing institutional conflicts of interest for all SRC staff, and implement this plan when the need arises.</p>
<p>6. Other Related SRC Activities</p>
<p>The SRC shall support other EPC program activities such as:</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide technical assistance to organizations that seek to use EPC reports as a  basis for decision-making; for example, producing tools to enhance the quality  and effectiveness of patient care, etc.</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide assistance to evaluate the use and impact of EPC evidence reports.</p>
<p>Anticipated Period of Performance:</p>
<p>The anticipated period of performance for this proposed acquisition will be from approximately August 15, 2017, through August 14, 2022, for a base period of one year and 4, one-year option periods.</p>
<p>Other Important Considerations:</p>
<p>Sources are expected to have personnel, corporate history, and facilities adequate for promoting scientific rigor through methodological work for systematic reviews and evidence synthesis, promoting transparency and trust through managing topic selection and review processes, and promoting consistency across EPCs through collaborative efforts and mutual learning using in person and virtual convening methods and tools such as databases and shared resources.</p>

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Veterinary Services (VS) National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) combine to make up the only Federal facility in the United States engaged in the diagnosis of animal diseases, both domestic and foreign. Administered under the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), NVSL is a key element in the support of Federal animal health programs. Each laboratory within NVSL also provides assistance to the state and Federal agencies and laboratories, educational institutions, and foreign governments in the diagnosis of animal diseases.
<p>The USDA, APHIS, VS, NVSL is committed to maintaining scientific excellence by continual improvement of the NVSL's Quality Management System (QMS). The development and continuing formal registration of a QMS confirms to the public and to the animal health world, both on a national and on an international basis, that the NVSL is committed to a continually improving quality program.<br />Laboratory support/service areas that are currently listed on the NVSL's ISO 9001 Certification of Registration include the Laboratory Resources Unit (LRU), Administrative Unit (AU), Program Administrative Services (PAS), and the National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN) at the NVSL's Ames, IA, location. The LRU provides laboratory support through the media preparation and glassware services, sample processing, and warehouse services including mail and package processing, compressed gas management, laundry services, receiving dock, specimen and equipment deliveries, and warehouse fulfillment activities. The AU and PAS provides services in the areas of human resources and training, procurement, budget, and user fee services. The NAHLN coordinates the work of groups of laboratories that provide animal disease surveillance and testing services. New laboratory support/services planned for a new ISO 9001 Certification of Registration at the NVSL's Orient Point, NY, location initially includes shipment processing.</p>
<p>The NVSL's Ames, IA, location was initially certified to the ISO 9001:2008 standards September 30, 2014, and is currently registered to these standards through September 29, 2017. However, a revised ISO standard was published September 15, 2015, and the NVSL is scheduled to transition to the ISO 9001:2015 standard in 2017. The objective is to contract with an internationally recognized accredited Registrar for transitioning certification to the ISO 9001:2015 Standard prior to September 29, 2017, with the option for two surveillance audits at yearly intervals. When the certified auditors/assessors have determined that the NVSL QMS meets the requirements of the most current version of ISO 9001, the Registrar will issue a certificate to the NVSL documenting satisfactory compliance with the ISO 9001:2015 Standard.</p>
<p>APHIS is seeking information from contractors as to their capacity to perform pre-assessment and audit activities related to providing the required ISO 9001:2015 certification services described above in a veterinary diagnostic laboratory setting. We would also need to verify whether there are small business contractors capable of providing this service. The USDA, APHIS intends to establish a fixed price contract with a base year and two option years with a single Registrar capable of meeting all the NVSL certification requirements.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 813920 with a small business size standard of $15 million.</p>
<p>The Government acknowledges that responses to this sources sought are not binding offers. The Government will not award a contract based on this Sources Sought Notice or the information received, nor will it reimburse participants for the information they provide. If you are an interested firm please provide the following information: 1) Size of business, including whether your company is a large or small business, and a point of contact; <br />2) DUNS number and CAGE code; 3) a brief Statement of Capability (no more than three pages) which demonstrates the ability to meet the specialized work requirements above. Include any past performance information on contracts of similar size and scope including auditing experience with Standard Industrial Classification 8734. Please send your responses electronically.</p>
<p>Please respond to this Sources Sought by Tuesday, November 29, 2016 at <br />3:00 p.m. CT. You may send your response to the attention of Leah Schultz by email to leah.h.schultz@aphis.usda.gov.</p>

<DESC><br />MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY<br />NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR SOLICITATION
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is conducting market research to support the National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR) requirement for a dual sampling system.</p>
<p>The FDA is seeking small business sources to determine the availability and capability of small business manufacturers or small businesses capable of supplying, and subsequently maintaining, a U.S. made product of a small business manufacturer or producer for the items described herein. Other than small business concerns are also encouraged to submit capability statements. The following information is provided to assist the FDA in conducting Market Research to identify potential contractors for this effort.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is-334516- Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing; Small Business Size Standard is 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>The NCTR Inhalation Toxicology Facility is a research facility at the NCTR for conducting inhalation toxicology studies in vivo. The inhalation facility is equipped with six 50-port nose-only inhalation exposure systems that were manufactured by TSE Systems (St. Louis, MO). An upcoming protocol will test a substance to be aerosolized in this system. The substance will be in two different phases, vapor and particulate, due to its semi-volatility. For this reason, two sample systems are required to check the concentration in both particulate and vapor phases. In order to characterize the test article in both phases, dual sampling is necessary. A second sampling system is needed to create a dual sampling system in each of the existing inhalation exposure units. This requirement is urgent; the study cannot be performed until a sampling system has been acquired to create the dual sampling system that is needed. The system must be 100% compatible with the existing TSE inhalation units (i.e., hardware as well as software). The existing inhalation units are currently covered under a service agreement contract and the new dual sampling system must maintain this service coverage on the existing equipment.</p>
<p>Performance requirements</p>
<p>General specifications:</p>
<p>The components and/or equipment shall be newly manufactured, not used, refurbished, or previously used for demonstration. <br />Minimum specifications- Brand name or equal</p>
<p>1. A sampling system that is capable of measuring the concentration of compounds in the vapor or particulate phase is required to combine with existing equipment to create a dual sampling system used in inhalation exposure units to sample test articles in two different phases.<br />2. The dual sampling system must be able to have two samples been taken concurrently and independently in order to measure the concentration of the total test substance (both phases) to determine the exposure to animal.<br />3. The range of sampling flow rate for the sampling system must be identical to that of the existing sampling system (purchased from TSE Systems, Inc.).<br />4. The software installed in the existing system should be modified such that the dual sampling system can be activated at the same time.</p>
<p>Installation, Training and Additional System Requirements.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide in-side delivery, installation and operator familiarization training for the system. The contractor shall provide a minimum of one (1) day of on-site training (in addition to installation of the system) to include operations (including software), calibration, optimization, basic and routine preventative maintenance procedures and cleaning requirements.</p>
<p>Offered systems shall be a turn-key solution i.e. the contractor shall be responsible for providing all hardware, components, instruments, computers, software, and that otherwise required to meet these specifications and the FDA's stated need. The systems shall be delivered with all necessary supplies and accessories required for installation and start-up.</p>
<p>Systems shall be warranted for not less than one (1) year from FDA acceptance of the system(s) to include on-site training. Warranty service shall include trouble-shooting capabilities based on complete knowledge of the entire system, immediate access to replacement parts, and immediate access to system improvements and updates. Phone and email technical support shall be included for a minimum of 1-year.</p>
<p>Post-Warranty Preventative Maintenance Agreement shall, at a minimum, include the following</p>
<p>- Minimum of one (1) planned preventative maintenance visit per contract period.<br />- Unlimited phone and email support during the contractor's normal operating hours.<br />- Preventative maintenance shall include all labor, travel, and parts (except consumables);<br />- Unlimited corrective maintenance, service and repairs shall include all labor, travel, and parts (except consumables); Provide service response time with quote.<br />- Pricing shall be inclusive of all labor, travel, replacement parts, components, subassemblies, etc.<br />- Performance by formally trained and certified technicians/engineers, following Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) specifications, manuals, and service bulletins, using OEM replacement parts, components, subassemblies, etc.<br />- Access by the FDA Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), Technical Representative (TR) and system operator personnel to the manufacturer's call center for technical assistance, which is staffed by senior engineers to provide a high level of expertise for troubleshooting the instrument. <br />- System software and firmware updates required for reliability improvements and correction of any defects;<br />- Service Records and Reports<br />The Contractor shall, commensurate with the completion of each service call or preventative maintenance visit, provide the end-user of the equipment and the Contracting Officer with a copy of a field service report/ticket identifying the equipment name, manufacturer, model number, and serial number of the equipment being serviced/repaired and detailing the reason for the service call, a detailed description of the work performed, the test instruments or other equipment used to affect the repair or otherwise perform the service, the name(s) and contact information of the technician who performed the repair/service, and for information purposes, the on-site hours expended and parts/components replaced.</p>
<p>FOB Point Destination. All items shall include shipping, handling and in-side delivery to the destination identified herein. Delivery/installation date is within 90 calendar days after receipt of order. FOB Point of Delivery for Services and Supplies will be the FDA located at 3900 NCTR Road, Jefferson, AR 72079.</p>
<p>Alternative solutions will be considered insofar as any such alternate system and/or system components meet the minimum brand name or equal technical requirements.</p>
<p>The offeror shall furnish sufficient technical information necessary for the Government to conclusively determine that the offered products/services and components meet the technical requirements identified above.

Data collectors observe use of restraints and restraint type, and obtain information on children's ages, weights, and heights by interviewing a knowledgeable adult in the vehicle.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a specific set of high-vacuum turbomolecular pumps, cryogenic pumps and dry roughing pumps. The pumps will be used to support a set of nanofabrication, processing, and analytical tools in the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST) NanoFab that are used as a shared resource accessible to researchers from industry, academia, NIST, and other government agencies. After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside. Tool down time causes delays in critical CNST NanoFab projects and increases operational costs. Vacuum pump failures constitute a large percentage of the tool failures, and repair or replacement of some vacuum pump models have long lead times. To minimize tool downtime and control costs the CNST intends to maintain a complete set of spare vacuum pumps to support the CNST NanoFab's tool set. The spare pumps will be drop-in replacements for the pumps listed in Table 1. The pumps being purchased include cryogenic pumps, turbo-molecular (turbo) pumps and dry roughing pumps as itemized in the table. The pumps shall meet the following requirements.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION/SYNOPSIS
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>This National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH) project is for work related the evaluation of new antibacterial therapeutic candidates. A critical step in the evaluation these therapeutic candidates involves demonstrating in vivo efficacy in rodent models. A commonly used assay measures reduction of bacteria or colony-forming units (CFU) in infected thigh or lung tissue in mice over a 24-hour dosing period. For approved drugs, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships obtained from these models historically have been shown to correlate well with plasma exposures required to treat bacterial infections in the clinic. Therefore, these results provide critical data to de-risk development of new therapeutics.</p>
<p>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES</p>
<p>The purpose of this Small Business Sources Sought Notice (SBSS) is to identify qualified small or small disadvantaged businesses, capable of and interested in performing the work described herein. The NIAID does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses received nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted.</p>
<p>The objective of this acquisition is to perform testing of new antibacterial therapeutic candidates provided by the NIAID (or a designee) in murine models of thigh and lung infections in neutropenic mice that have been previously established and validated with known drugs. The NIAID seeks to acquire this testing capability against a specified selection of drug-susceptible and drug-resistant strains of bacteria using models that measure reduction of bacterial burden in infected thigh or lung tissue in mice over a 24-hour dosing period. In addition to the CFU reduction data, the NIAID seeks to acquire data on preliminary drug tolerability in mice to assist with dose selection for follow up efficacy studies. Required capabilities also include determination of drug concentrations in plasma of infected mice to enable correlation of PK exposure data with efficacy.</p>
<p><br />PROJECT REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>The NIAID intends to solicit proposals for the performance of approximately twenty-five (25) assessments of therapeutic candidates in murine models of thigh and lung infections in neutropenic mice to be requested over a period of twelve (12) months. A typical assessment for each therapeutic will include determinations of MIC against specified strains available in the models and MTD/tolerability over a range of doses in infected mice, measurement of CFU reduction in thigh or lunch tissue over a 24-hour period of dosing, and plasma analysis for drug exposure in infected mice from doses that parallel the efficacy study.</p>
<p>Of critical importance is the availability of thigh and lung infection models for a range of bacterial strains (specified below) that have already been established and validated using known drugs as positive controls. These models should be available using mice made neutropenic by standard methods of treatment with cyclophosphamide prior to bacterial challenge and drug dosing. The capability for dosing compounds using multiple routes of administration (PO, IP, IV) and a range of dosing intervals (qd, bid, tid) is required. Bacterial (CFU) burden must be evaluated after a period of 24 hours of drug dosing using standard methods involving tissue (thigh or lung) homogenization followed by dilution plating to permit accurate colony counts.</p>
<p>The specific strains of bacterial pathogens (clinical isolates are preferred) for which the NIAID requires validated models include the following: <br />- K. pneumonia - drug susceptible isolate; carbapenem-resistant metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL+) isolate; carbapenem-resistant (KPC-2+) isolate (not MBL+)<br />- E. coli - drug-susceptible isolate; extended-spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL+) isolate; carbapenem-resistant metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL+) isolate<br />- P. aeruginosa - drug-susceptible isolate; carbapenem-resistant, multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolate<br />- A. baumannii - drug-susceptible isolate, multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolate<br />- S. aureus - USA300 Methicillin-resistant (MRSA) isolate</p>
<p>CAPABILITY STATEMENT/INFORMATION SOUGHT</p>
<p>Sources are expected to have the expertise, personnel, and facilities to meet the requirements of this project. Tailored Capability Statements submitted in response to this announcement should demonstrate the offerors' qualifications and experience, specifically providing evidence as to their capability to perform this requirement, with particular attention to the following areas:</p>
<p>- Evidence of prior validation of reliable performance for the requested models, such as statistical analysis of the reproducibility of infection (from evaluation of challenge material, CFU burden immediately prior to drug treatment and vehicle control after 24 hours), as well as statistical analysis of the CFU reduction from a range of doses of positive control drugs.</p>
<p>- Thigh or lung models for the strains listed above must be available as already validated, "off the shelf" assays for immediate testing of candidate therapeutics.</p>
<p>- Demonstrated efficacy model capabilities described above.</p>
<p>- Expertise and capacity for conducting ascending-dose tolerability studies in infected mice to assist with dose selection for efficacy studies.</p>
<p>- Plasma sampling over multiple time points after dosing and bioanalysis capability, in order to provide plasma drug exposures and PK data for correlation to CFU reduction data from validation studies with known drugs.</p>
<p>- The capability to provide validated neutropenic murine models of thigh and lung infections for testing candidate therapeutics against the bacterial pathogens identified above.</p>
<p><br />HOW TO SUBMIT A RESPONSE / PAGE LIMITATIONS</p>
<p>Interested qualified small business organizations should submit a tailored capability statement for this requirement, not to exceed five pages, excluding resumes, describing the company's experience and ability to perform this effort which includes the following: (1) a summary list of similar work previously performed or being performed&#894; (2) demonstrated scientific and technical ability to carry out the work&#894; (3) the professional qualifications and specific experience of staff who may be assigned to the requirement&#894; (4) a general description of the facilities and other resources needed to perform the work.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis and sources sought notice.  Naval Supply Systems Command Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Philadelphia intends to solicit Pacific Propeller International (10210)  located in Kent, WA for the repair of C-130 Propellers, NIIN 00-030-9552 P/N 54H60-111, under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Pacific Propeller International is the only known source qualified to perform repairs on these items.  The Government does not have the technical data or data rights to develop new sources, or conduct completion, for these repairs.  The estimated award date for the LTC is APR 2017, the contemplated duration of the LTC is five years.


While the Government only currently has the above-named source for repair of these items, in the event, unbeknownst to the Government, another source has the technical data and data rights to perform this work, potential interest in such repairs by another source or other sources would be welcome.
 In addition, because the items are considered critical to flight/mission (critical application items), any other interested sources will be required to submit and have approved a Source Approval Request (SAR) package in order to be eligible for repair work for these items. A SAR brochure describing the process for SAR submission and approval is available at https://www.navsup.navy.mil/navsup/ourteam/navsupwss/business_opps. It should also be noted as to this contemplated repair BOA and delivery orders, in the event a source were to obtain technical data and data rights necessary for repairs from the current repair source, the time required for approval of a new source is normally such that award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.
 Thus a future SAR approval, if received, may be useable for future repair requirements for these items. 
For information or questions regarding this notice, please contact Mr. Christopher Daubert, Contract Negotiator (Code N721) by e-mail Christopher.daubert@navy.mil.

<p>Statement of Work<br />Boiler and Pressure Vessel Inspection Services<br />Various Buildings Throughout the General Services Administration (GSA) Region 6 (States of Kansas, Missouri, Iowa, and Nebraska)</p>
<p><br />The resulting award of this SOW will be a firm fixed price (FFP)</p>
<p>NAICS:  541340 titled "Building Inspection Services"<br />Size Standard:  $7,500,000<br />FSC Code:  4520 titled "Space and Water Heating Equipment"</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>GSA manages approximately 80 owned facilities in the GSA's Heartland Region (IA, KS, MO, NE).  Many of these contain boilers and/or pressure vessels.  All boilers and pressure vessels permanently located at each facility require annual in-service safety inspections.  High-pressure boilers and low-pressure steam heating boilers require an annual internal inspection.  Historically, GSA has performed such inspections in-house using a person holding a current commission from the National Board of Boiler and Pressure Vessel Inspectors.  Functional changes within the organization over time, have led GSA to outsource this service.</p>
<p>Scope of Work</p>
<p>The resulting task order from this RFQ requires the Contractor to conduct annual inspections on all boiler and pressure vessels within the GSA Region 6.   Appendix A has a listing of all locations and numbers of boilers and pressure vessels in the Region.  The inspector shall use the National Board Inspection and/or ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Codes as a guide for the required inspections. Note that one location, the 4300 Goodfellow Federal Complex, requires a site specific work safety plan to be submitted to the GSA CO for review and approval prior to starting work at the location. See Appendix B, Goofellow Federal Complex Environmental Conditions.</p>
<p>All low-pressure steam heating boilers (15 p.s.i. or less) and all high-pressure boilers (greater than 15 p.s.i.) shall be externally inspected while in operation (December through March) and internally inspected after the heating season (April to August).  All hot water heating boilers and all other types of fired and unfired pressure vessels shall normally be inspected externally while in operation, but may occasionally be inspected internally at the inspector's discretion.  GSA or their representative is responsible for preparing each vessel for inspection.</p>
<p>Internal Inspections.  The yearly internal inspections of all high-pressure boilers and low-pressure steam heating boilers will be conducted during the non-heating season.  Hot water heating boilers and fired and unfired pressure vessels shall be inspected internally at the Inspector's discretion. An internal examination may not be required if the pressure vessel is stamped with the original wall thickness and the thickness survey shows no loss of material. Boilers/Pressure vessels in which the original wall thickness is unknown will have an initial internal examination performed to determine the baseline condition of the vessel. Internal examinations shall include a thorough inspection of the following:</p>
<p>a. Boiler/Vessel connections:  Threaded connections will be inspected to ensure that an adequate number of threads are engaged. All openings leading to any external fittings or controls will examined as thoroughly as possible to ensure they are free from obstructions.</p>
<p>b. Boiler/Vessel closures: Any special closures, including those on autoclaves, will be checked for adequacy and wear. A check will also be made for cracks at areas of high stress concentration.</p>
<p>c. Boiler/Vessel internals:  Where pressure vessels are equipped with removable internals, these internals need not be completely removed, provided evidence exists that deterioration in regions rendered inaccessible by the internals is not occurring to an extent that might constitute a hazard or to an extent beyond that found in more readily accessible parts of the vessel.</p>
<p>d. Corrosion:  The type of corrosion (pitted or uniform), its location, and any obvious conditions will be recorded.</p>
<p>e.   Thickness:  A thickness examination of the boiler/pressure vessel wall and dished heads and documentation for permanent record keeping. Appropriate non-destructive testing methods will be used as identified by the inspector.</p>
<p>Operational Inspections.  External/operational inspections will be conducted during the heating season.  The inspection will consist of testing the operating controls, safety valves and devices, and a visual inspection of the boiler/pressure vessel. The inspection of the boiler/pressure vessels shall include the following: A thorough external examination of the boiler/pressure vessel and associated equipment including verification of the welded connections to determine the proper joint efficiency to employ during the stress analysis. External examinations include a thorough inspection of the following:<br />a. Insulation or other coverings<br />b. Evidence of leakage<br />c. Structural attachments<br />d. Vessel connections<br />e. Miscellaneous conditions<br />f. Surface inspection<br />g. Welded joints<br />h. A thorough inspection of the boiler/pressure relief valves and other safety devices to ensure the vessel is operating within its specified pressure range and is being adequately protected.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the Inspector to determine if the equipment appears to be in a safe operating condition, that all repairs and alterations conform to the applicable codes, and that each boiler and pressure vessel will perform in accordance with the applicable inspection requirements.  Any deficiencies noted by the Contractor that present a safety or operational risk or failure and which can be resolved easily, shall be resolved while on-site with the assistance of the O&amp;M Contractor and/or GSA representative.</p>
<p>Should the inspector, using professional judgment, believe a boiler or pressure vessel to be unsafe at the time of his inspection, he/she may at their discretion, withdraw the certificate and require the boiler or pressure vessel be shutdown until corrective action is taken. The boiler or pressure vessel shall not be placed back in service, nor the certificate reissued until the deficiencies have been corrected and the boiler/pressure vessel is re-inspected and found suitable for use.<br /> <br />Period of Performance</p>
<p>The period of performance is January 1, 2017 to August 31, 2017. All external inspections shall be coordinated, scheduled and completed with delivery of all GSA Form 1034's (titled "Certificate of Inspection of Pressure Vessels") between January 15 and March 15, 2017.  All internal inspections shall be coordinated, scheduled and completed between the end of the heating season and no later than July 15, 2017.  All deliverables including reports shall be delivered no later than August 1, 2017.  The final completion date for this task order is August 31, 2017.</p>
<p>Deliverables</p>
<p>Within 10 working days of completing an inspection, the contractor shall furnish the GSA Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) with a written report of findings and deficiencies.  The National Board Inspection Code Forms NB-6, Boiler-Fired Pressure Vessel Report of Inspection and NB-7, Pressure Vessels Report of Inspection are acceptable forms for reporting findings.  The report shall be generated and forwarded to the GSA COR and Contracting Officer electronically.  The Contractor shall also complete, sign, date and post (or supply to the GSA COR on site) a GSA Form 1034 (Certificate of Inspection of Pressure Vessels) on or near the equipment, after each successful inspection.</p>
<p><br />Qualifications</p>
<p>All inspections will be accomplished by an Inspector holding a current, valid National Board Commission. The contractor shall supply a copy of the Inspector (or each inspector's) National Board Commission to the GSA COR prior to beginning any inspections.</p>
<p>Schedule</p>
<p>After award the contractor will be given a contact list of GSA Field Office contacts. All inspections shall be coordinated with the GSA Field Office contacts, or their designated building managers, in sufficient advance notice to avoid operational interruptions and permit GSA representatives time to perform any preparation work required by the contractor. Coordination means the contractor shall contact the GSA Field Office contacts with a proposed schedule, get their agreement, ensure they are aware of any preparation needs, and then, prior to beginning the work, the contractor shall submit the agreed upon schedule to the GSA COR. Any changes to the schedule shall follow the same process.</p>
<p>In the event that an inspector travels to a location for inspection and the equipment can't be inspected, the contractor should contact the GSA COR and supply them with proof the inspection was arranged for the time the inspector showed up (email documentation is acceptable) and an estimate for the cost of re-inspection of the location including any required additional administration, air fare, hotel, car rental, per diem, and minimum required labor charges for the travel time of the inspector. GSA will determine if the inspection will be allowed to be rescheduled or skipped and the items deducted. Original travel costs agreed to will be paid.</p>

<p>Appendix A - List of equipment in the Heartland Region<br />The following locations give the current number of Boilers (B), Hot Water Heaters (HWH) and other known Pressure Vessels (PVs) located at each site. Numbers are not guaranteed to be 100% accurate but reflect the best information known at the time of RFQ issuance.</p>
<p>Once inspections begin, if there is the need to modify the task order to add or delete inspections, the addition and deletion of inspections required will be done at the price quoted per type of inspection at the location you price below.  There will be no additional allowance given for travel if an additional inspection(s) is/are required unless it is such a large addition that it would require the contractor to stay an additional night at the location.<br />Likewise, for the deletion of inspection(s), there will not be a reimbursement to GSA for travel costs if an inspection is deleted from the task order unless the deletion is such a large deletion that it would not require the vendor to stay at that location.</p>
<p>For example, if you quote a price of $300 for a pressure vessel inspection for Wichita, and it happens there are actually 12 PVs required and not 11 as stated in this SOW, the GSA will use the $300 for the additional PV inspection to be issued via bilateral task order modification and no additional travel costs will be given.</p>

<p>Approximately 82 total contaminants that have the potential to affect worker safety and health were reported by Tetra Tech on site (Cyanide was reported by SCS Engineers 2008 Combined Preliminary Assessment/Site Inspection Report (starting on page 4-19) and is provided as part of this list of contaminants). The added totals of each variation of the asbestos contaminants, the xylene contaminants, and the polychlorinated biphenyls contaminates may make them a potential safety and health hazard as well. A list of contaminants and their locations can be found in Appendix B, Tables 1 through 14 of the 2013 Tetra Tech Occupational Exposure Evaluation Report. The 2013 Tetra Tech report does not constitute a complete list of potential contaminates.</p>
<p>Twenty-one additional reports assessing various aspects of the environmental contamination on the Goodfellow Federal Complex are available upon request. Safety Fact Sheets are provided for each contaminant (located on the provided cd). All these reports were compiled to assess the contamination from an environmental perspective.<br />Environmental action thresholds do not necessarily correlate into OSHA permissible exposure limits (PELs) because they were the result of testing/sampling in a static environment. OSHA requirements involve sampling/testing using an 8-hour time weighted average/30-minute excursion limit while each job specific activity is in progress.</p>
<p>Contractors, whose employees are engaged in work that could potentially put them into contact with, or disturb any and/or all of the environmental contaminants present in such a manner as to make them airborne, shall perform the appropriate hazard assessment and testing to protect their employees according to OSHA 29 CFR 1910 and 1926 regulations. The hazard assessment shall include industrial hygiene sampling/testing as necessary. Contractors shall take the appropriate protective measures to ensure their actions do not place other federal complex personnel at risk (i.e. post warning signs, install engineering controls, create barriers, erect containment, control access to work areas, etc.). Contractors will also ensure their employees decontaminate as required prior to leaving work areas and/or the job site so they do not cross contaminate non-contaminated areas/spaces.</p>
<p>Prior to beginning any work, the contractor shall prepare and submit to the GSA Contracting Officer for review, a site specific work/safety plan describing the protective measures they will use. Contractors shall provide any sampling/testing results as part of the safety plan.</p>
<p>Multiple building interiors (first and second floors) are reported to contain varying amounts of lead based-paint and/or particulate lead and mercury that could affect worker safety and health. Contaminated areas include the building spaces above and below the suspended ceiling tiles. Asbestos containing materials are also present in some of these spaces and are currently being managed in place. Work in areas that has the potential to disturb asbestos containing materials requires an asbestos work permit to be issued from the GSA Building Manager prior to the start of work. Construction projects that may affect asbestos containing materials require a pre-assessment to be accomplished and coordination through the GSA Region 6 Asbestos Program Manager prior to the start of work.</p>
<p>The asbestos pre-assessment for construction projects is typically performed by GSA. The Contractor is to verify with the GSA Contracting Officer before incorporating the pre-assessment into their proposal.<br />Multiple building interiors (basement/basement crawl spaces/utility tunnels) are reported to contain a variety of environmental contaminants that could affect worker safety and health. Contamination includes friable asbestos in the soil, different toxic metals on building surfaces and in the soil, different explosive compounds and phosphorus in the sump water and soil, and different organic compounds in the sump water and soil. Asbestos containing materials are also present in some of these spaces and are currently being managed in place. Work in areas that has the potential to disturb asbestos containing materials requires an asbestos work permit to be issued from the GSA Building Manager prior to the start of work. Construction projects that may affect asbestos containing materials require a pre-assessment to be accomplished and coordination through the GSA Region 6 Asbestos Program Manager prior to the start of work. The asbestos pre-assessment for construction projects is typically performed by GSA. The Contractor is to verify with the GSA Contracting Officer before incorporating the pre-assessment into their proposal.</p>
<p>Multiple building interiors (building electrical spaces and interior/exterior ground soil and ground water) are reported to contain a variety of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contamination. Building interior contamination includes PCBs in the concrete where PCB oil filled transformers used to be. The crawlspace soil of Building 108B is also reported to have PCB contamination. Exterior building ground soil and ground water is also contaminated with PCB contamination that could affect worker safety and health. Maintenance and construction projects that could disturb PCB laden concrete, interior/exterior ground soil or ground water must be coordinated through the<br />GSA Region 6 Environmental Program Manager prior to the start of work.</p>
<p>Multiple federal complex exterior areas are reported to be contaminated with a variety of environmental contaminants in the ground soil and ground water that could affect worker safety and health. Maintenance and construction projects that could disturb federal complex grounds/ground water must be coordinated through the GSA Region 6 Environmental Program Manager prior to the start of work.</p>
<p>GSA Region 6 Public Building Services has attached the 2013 Tetra Tech Occupational Exposure Evaluation Report and the SCS Engineers 2008 Combined Preliminary Assessment/Site Inspection Report with Addendum l (Interim Lead Wipe Sampling and Assessment Report) to this contract modification. GSA Region 6 Public Building Services made these reports and the twenty-one additional reports available in a reading library located at the Goodfellow Federal Office Complex, GSA St. Louis West Field Office, First Floor, Bldg. 107, 4300 Goodfellow Boulevard, St. Louis Missouri. In February, 2016, the GSA Region 6 Public Building Service contracted for additional lead and asbestos air sampling and lead wipe and lead micro-vacuum sampling in several buildings. GSA will make the results of this sampling/testing available upon receipt and review (expected to be released by the end of March, 2016).</p>

<p>Basis of Award</p>
<p>For this RFQ, one (1) task order award will be made to the quoter who quotes a "Go" on the technical criteria and has the lowest total evaluated price.  Thus, this RFQ is a lowest priced, technically acceptable (LBTA) RFQ.  Your technical quote must have a "Go" in order for your price to be evaluated.  If a vendor fails to receive a "Go" on the technical criteria, their price will not be evaluated.</p>
<p>Technical Evaluation Factor 1		National Board Commissions (Go/No Go)</p>
<p>For each person your firm intends to perform inspections, list their name, location of the inspections they will be performing, whether they will be performing internal and/or external inspections, and a copy of their National Board Commission.  One spreadsheet with the names, location(s), the types of the inspections they will be performing, and whether they have a National Board Commission will be sufficient for the spreadsheet.  You must also include the copies of the National Board Commissions as an attachment.   There must be a National Board Commission for each individual performing inspections.  Failure of your firm to provide an individual with a National Board Commission for each location will render your technical quote with a "No Go."  Your firm may have an inspector perform inspections in multiple locations.  If you originally quote an inspector, and you must make a substitution, that inspector substitution must meet the same qualifications and be approved in writing by the Contracting Officer.</p>

<p><br />Price Evaluation for Award</p>
<p>The below price formula will be used on each CLIN.  The sum of each CLIN as determined by the formula below then be added together to determine the lowest price.</p>
<p>(Cost per internal inspection quoted multiplied (x) by number of <br />internal inspections) + (Cost Per external inspection quoted multiplied (x) by number of external inspections) plus (+) travel costs equal (=) your total price quoted for that CLIN.</p>
<p>When using a spread sheet be careful of rounding issues. The shown numbers should match up with the totals to the penny.</p>

<p>Statement of Work<br />Boiler and Pressure Vessel Inspection Services<br />Various Buildings Throughout the General Services Administration (GSA) Region 6 (States of Kansas, Missouri, Iowa, and Nebraska)</p>
<p><br />The resulting award of this SOW will be a firm fixed price (FFP)</p>
<p>NAICS:  541340 titled "Building Inspection Services"<br />Size Standard:  $7,500,000<br />FSC Code:  4520 titled "Space and Water Heating Equipment"</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>GSA manages approximately 80 owned facilities in the GSA's Heartland Region (IA, KS, MO, NE).  Many of these contain boilers and/or pressure vessels.  All boilers and pressure vessels permanently located at each facility require annual in-service safety inspections.  High-pressure boilers and low-pressure steam heating boilers require an annual internal inspection.  Historically, GSA has performed such inspections in-house using a person holding a current commission from the National Board of Boiler and Pressure Vessel Inspectors.  Functional changes within the organization over time, have led GSA to outsource this service.</p>
<p>Scope of Work</p>
<p>The resulting task order from this RFQ requires the Contractor to conduct annual inspections on all boiler and pressure vessels within the GSA Region 6.   Appendix A has a listing of all locations and numbers of boilers and pressure vessels in the Region.  The inspector shall use the National Board Inspection and/or ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Codes as a guide for the required inspections. Note that one location, the 4300 Goodfellow Federal Complex, requires a site specific work safety plan to be submitted to the GSA CO for review and approval prior to starting work at the location. See Appendix B, Goofellow Federal Complex Environmental Conditions.</p>
<p>All low-pressure steam heating boilers (15 p.s.i. or less) and all high-pressure boilers (greater than 15 p.s.i.) shall be externally inspected while in operation (December through March) and internally inspected after the heating season (April to August).  All hot water heating boilers and all other types of fired and unfired pressure vessels shall normally be inspected externally while in operation, but may occasionally be inspected internally at the inspector's discretion.  GSA or their representative is responsible for preparing each vessel for inspection.</p>
<p>Internal Inspections.  The yearly internal inspections of all high-pressure boilers and low-pressure steam heating boilers will be conducted during the non-heating season.  Hot water heating boilers and fired and unfired pressure vessels shall be inspected internally at the Inspector's discretion. An internal examination may not be required if the pressure vessel is stamped with the original wall thickness and the thickness survey shows no loss of material. Boilers/Pressure vessels in which the original wall thickness is unknown will have an initial internal examination performed to determine the baseline condition of the vessel. Internal examinations shall include a thorough inspection of the following:</p>
<p>a. Boiler/Vessel connections:  Threaded connections will be inspected to ensure that an adequate number of threads are engaged. All openings leading to any external fittings or controls will examined as thoroughly as possible to ensure they are free from obstructions.</p>
<p>b. Boiler/Vessel closures: Any special closures, including those on autoclaves, will be checked for adequacy and wear. A check will also be made for cracks at areas of high stress concentration.</p>
<p>c. Boiler/Vessel internals:  Where pressure vessels are equipped with removable internals, these internals need not be completely removed, provided evidence exists that deterioration in regions rendered inaccessible by the internals is not occurring to an extent that might constitute a hazard or to an extent beyond that found in more readily accessible parts of the vessel.</p>
<p>d. Corrosion:  The type of corrosion (pitted or uniform), its location, and any obvious conditions will be recorded.</p>
<p>e.   Thickness:  A thickness examination of the boiler/pressure vessel wall and dished heads and documentation for permanent record keeping. Appropriate non-destructive testing methods will be used as identified by the inspector.</p>
<p>Operational Inspections.  External/operational inspections will be conducted during the heating season.  The inspection will consist of testing the operating controls, safety valves and devices, and a visual inspection of the boiler/pressure vessel. The inspection of the boiler/pressure vessels shall include the following: A thorough external examination of the boiler/pressure vessel and associated equipment including verification of the welded connections to determine the proper joint efficiency to employ during the stress analysis. External examinations include a thorough inspection of the following:<br />a. Insulation or other coverings<br />b. Evidence of leakage<br />c. Structural attachments<br />d. Vessel connections<br />e. Miscellaneous conditions<br />f. Surface inspection<br />g. Welded joints<br />h. A thorough inspection of the boiler/pressure relief valves and other safety devices to ensure the vessel is operating within its specified pressure range and is being adequately protected.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the Inspector to determine if the equipment appears to be in a safe operating condition, that all repairs and alterations conform to the applicable codes, and that each boiler and pressure vessel will perform in accordance with the applicable inspection requirements.  Any deficiencies noted by the Contractor that present a safety or operational risk or failure and which can be resolved easily, shall be resolved while on-site with the assistance of the O&amp;M Contractor and/or GSA representative.</p>
<p>Should the inspector, using professional judgment, believe a boiler or pressure vessel to be unsafe at the time of his inspection, he/she may at their discretion, withdraw the certificate and require the boiler or pressure vessel be shutdown until corrective action is taken. The boiler or pressure vessel shall not be placed back in service, nor the certificate reissued until the deficiencies have been corrected and the boiler/pressure vessel is re-inspected and found suitable for use.<br /> <br />Period of Performance</p>
<p>The period of performance is January 1, 2017 to August 31, 2017. All external inspections shall be coordinated, scheduled and completed with delivery of all GSA Form 1034's (titled "Certificate of Inspection of Pressure Vessels") between January 15 and March 15, 2017.  All internal inspections shall be coordinated, scheduled and completed between the end of the heating season and no later than July 15, 2017.  All deliverables including reports shall be delivered no later than August 1, 2017.  The final completion date for this task order is August 31, 2017.</p>
<p>Deliverables</p>
<p>Within 10 working days of completing an inspection, the contractor shall furnish the GSA Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) with a written report of findings and deficiencies.  The National Board Inspection Code Forms NB-6, Boiler-Fired Pressure Vessel Report of Inspection and NB-7, Pressure Vessels Report of Inspection are acceptable forms for reporting findings.  The report shall be generated and forwarded to the GSA COR and Contracting Officer electronically.  The Contractor shall also complete, sign, date and post (or supply to the GSA COR on site) a GSA Form 1034 (Certificate of Inspection of Pressure Vessels) on or near the equipment, after each successful inspection.</p>
<p><br />Qualifications</p>
<p>All inspections will be accomplished by an Inspector holding a current, valid National Board Commission. The contractor shall supply a copy of the Inspector (or each inspector's) National Board Commission to the GSA COR prior to beginning any inspections.</p>
<p>Schedule</p>
<p>After award the contractor will be given a contact list of GSA Field Office contacts. All inspections shall be coordinated with the GSA Field Office contacts, or their designated building managers, in sufficient advance notice to avoid operational interruptions and permit GSA representatives time to perform any preparation work required by the contractor. Coordination means the contractor shall contact the GSA Field Office contacts with a proposed schedule, get their agreement, ensure they are aware of any preparation needs, and then, prior to beginning the work, the contractor shall submit the agreed upon schedule to the GSA COR. Any changes to the schedule shall follow the same process.</p>
<p>In the event that an inspector travels to a location for inspection and the equipment can't be inspected, the contractor should contact the GSA COR and supply them with proof the inspection was arranged for the time the inspector showed up (email documentation is acceptable) and an estimate for the cost of re-inspection of the location including any required additional administration, air fare, hotel, car rental, per diem, and minimum required labor charges for the travel time of the inspector. GSA will determine if the inspection will be allowed to be rescheduled or skipped and the items deducted. Original travel costs agreed to will be paid.</p>

<p>Appendix A - List of equipment in the Heartland Region<br />The following locations give the current number of Boilers (B), Hot Water Heaters (HWH) and other known Pressure Vessels (PVs) located at each site. Numbers are not guaranteed to be 100% accurate but reflect the best information known at the time of RFQ issuance.</p>
<p>Once inspections begin, if there is the need to modify the task order to add or delete inspections, the addition and deletion of inspections required will be done at the price quoted per type of inspection at the location you price below.  There will be no additional allowance given for travel if an additional inspection(s) is/are required unless it is such a large addition that it would require the contractor to stay an additional night at the location.<br />Likewise, for the deletion of inspection(s), there will not be a reimbursement to GSA for travel costs if an inspection is deleted from the task order unless the deletion is such a large deletion that it would not require the vendor to stay at that location.</p>
<p>For example, if you quote a price of $300 for a pressure vessel inspection for Wichita, and it happens there are actually 12 PVs required and not 11 as stated in this SOW, the GSA will use the $300 for the additional PV inspection to be issued via bilateral task order modification and no additional travel costs will be given.</p>

<p>Goodfellow Federal Complex Contract Environmental Conditions Language<br />Many of the facilities and grounds on the Goodfellow Federal Complex, St. Louis, Missouri have been reported to be environmentally contaminated with varying concentrations of hazardous chemicals/materials. The following list of reported environmental contaminants that have the potential to affect worker safety and health is extracted from the 2013 Tetra Tech Occupational Exposure Evaluation Report.</p>
<p>ASBESTOS<br />Amosite - trace amounts up to 6%<br />Chrysotile - trace amounts up to 10%<br />Crocidolite - trace amounts<br />Total Asbestos - trace amounts up to 15%</p>

<p>Approximately 82 total contaminants that have the potential to affect worker safety and health were reported by Tetra Tech on site (Cyanide was reported by SCS Engineers 2008 Combined Preliminary Assessment/Site Inspection Report (starting on page 4-19) and is provided as part of this list of contaminants). The added totals of each variation of the asbestos contaminants, the xylene contaminants, and the polychlorinated biphenyls contaminates may make them a potential safety and health hazard as well. A list of contaminants and their locations can be found in Appendix B, Tables 1 through 14 of the 2013 Tetra Tech Occupational Exposure Evaluation Report. The 2013 Tetra Tech report does not constitute a complete list of potential contaminates.</p>
<p>Twenty-one additional reports assessing various aspects of the environmental contamination on the Goodfellow Federal Complex are available upon request. Safety Fact Sheets are provided for each contaminant (located on the provided cd). All these reports were compiled to assess the contamination from an environmental perspective.<br />Environmental action thresholds do not necessarily correlate into OSHA permissible exposure limits (PELs) because they were the result of testing/sampling in a static environment. OSHA requirements involve sampling/testing using an 8-hour time weighted average/30-minute excursion limit while each job specific activity is in progress.</p>
<p>Contractors, whose employees are engaged in work that could potentially put them into contact with, or disturb any and/or all of the environmental contaminants present in such a manner as to make them airborne, shall perform the appropriate hazard assessment and testing to protect their employees according to OSHA 29 CFR 1910 and 1926 regulations. The hazard assessment shall include industrial hygiene sampling/testing as necessary. Contractors shall take the appropriate protective measures to ensure their actions do not place other federal complex personnel at risk (i.e. post warning signs, install engineering controls, create barriers, erect containment, control access to work areas, etc.). Contractors will also ensure their employees decontaminate as required prior to leaving work areas and/or the job site so they do not cross contaminate non-contaminated areas/spaces.</p>
<p>Prior to beginning any work, the contractor shall prepare and submit to the GSA Contracting Officer for review, a site specific work/safety plan describing the protective measures they will use. Contractors shall provide any sampling/testing results as part of the safety plan.</p>
<p>Multiple building interiors (first and second floors) are reported to contain varying amounts of lead based-paint and/or particulate lead and mercury that could affect worker safety and health. Contaminated areas include the building spaces above and below the suspended ceiling tiles.

<p><br />Hourly Price used in calculating Internal Inspections:	$_____________________<br />(This hourly rate must be at or below the hourly rate in your FSS contract for the labor category you list below)</p>
<p>Labor Category on your FSS Contract you used 		______________________<br />that most closely resembles the work required under this <br />SOW for Internal Inspections:</p>

<p>Labor Category on your FSS Contract you used 		______________________<br />that most closely resembles the work required under this <br />SOW for External Inspections</p>
<p>Basis of Award</p>
<p>For this RFQ, one (1) task order award will be made to the quoter who quotes a "Go" on the technical criteria and has the lowest total evaluated price.  Thus, this RFQ is a lowest priced, technically acceptable (LBTA) RFQ.  Your technical quote must have a "Go" in order for your price to be evaluated.  If a vendor fails to receive a "Go" on the technical criteria, their price will not be evaluated.</p>
<p>Technical Evaluation Factor 1		National Board Commissions (Go/No Go)</p>
<p>For each person your firm intends to perform inspections, list their name, location of the inspections they will be performing, whether they will be performing internal and/or external inspections, and a copy of their National Board Commission.  One spreadsheet with the names, location(s), the types of the inspections they will be performing, and whether they have a National Board Commission will be sufficient for the spreadsheet.  You must also include the copies of the National Board Commissions as an attachment.   There must be a National Board Commission for each individual performing inspections.  Failure of your firm to provide an individual with a National Board Commission for each location will render your technical quote with a "No Go."  Your firm may have an inspector perform inspections in multiple locations.  If you originally quote an inspector, and you must make a substitution, that inspector substitution must meet the same qualifications and be approved in writing by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Sample Spreadsheet:</p>
<p>Name	Location	External	Internal	NBC<br />John Doe	Wichita, KS	x	x	x<br />John Doe 	Kansas City, KS	x		x<br />Sally Smith	Pittsburg, KS		x	x<br />John Doe	Pittsburg, KS	x		x</p>
<p><br />Price Evaluation for Award</p>
<p>The below price formula will be used on each CLIN.  The sum of each CLIN as determined by the formula below then be added together to determine the lowest price.</p>
<p>(Cost per internal inspection quoted multiplied (x) by number of <br />internal inspections) + (Cost Per external inspection quoted multiplied (x) by number of external inspections) plus (+) travel costs equal (=) your total price quoted for that CLIN.</p>
<p>When using a spread sheet be careful of rounding issues. The shown numbers should match up with the totals to the penny.</p>

<CONTACT>Crystal E. North, Phone 9126525183, Email crystal.e.north@usace.army.mil
<DESC>The Savannah District Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) for large scale construction contracts (exceeding $25 million) within the Savannah District<br />Design/Construction Boundaries (http://www.sas.usace.army.mil/About/District-Boundaries/).
<p><br />Some of the factors that may be considered regarding their use are:</p>
<p>(1) The project will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades.</p>
<p>(2) There is a shortage of skilled labor in the region in which the construction project will be sited.</p>
<p>(3) Completion of the project will require an extended period of time.</p>
<p>(4) Project labor agreements have been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of the project.</p>
<p>(5) A project labor agreement will promote the agency's long term program interests, such as facilitating the training of a skilled workforce to meet the agency's future construction needs.<br />PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in.</p>
<p>(5) A project labor agreement will promote the agency's long term program interests, such as facilitating the training of a skilled workforce to meet the agency's future construction needs.</p>
<p><br />PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). The construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:</p>
<p>(1) Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts within the Savannah District Design/Construction Boundaries (http://www.sas.usace.army.mil/About/District-Boundaries/)?</p>
<p>(2) Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor?</p>
<p>(3) Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?</p>
<p>(4) Have there been any Project labor agreements used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area?</p>
<p>(5) Would a project labor agreement promote Savannah District's long term program interests, such as facilitating the training of a skilled workforce to meet the agency's future construction needs?</p>
<p>(6) What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a U.S. Army Corps of Engineer, Savannah District contract?</p>
<p><br />Responses shall be submitted via email to crystal.e.north@usace.army.mil no later than 3 p.m. (EST) on 11 December 2017. This is NOT a Request for Proposal and does not constitute any commitment by the Government. Responses to this labor market survey will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.

<DESC>A. INTRODUCTION
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI). This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this RFI is to gain information leading to Government/Industry partnering to accelerate the development of technologies that will enable the Warfighter to be more effective, efficient and lethal.</p>
<p>The Systems Adaptive Red Team /Technical Support and Operational Analysis (ART/TSOA) invites industry, academia, individuals, and laboratories to submit technology demonstration papers addressing innovative technologies and capabilities that can be used in challenging environments:</p>
<p>Physical (Terrain -Natural &amp; Urban) <br />Electronic (Frequency Congestion &amp; Overload) <br />Contested (Electronic Interference, Cyber Attacks, &amp; CBRNE)</p>
<p>The ART project supports the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics and Technology (ASA(ALT)) to improve Warfighter maneuver, survivability and lethality. The ART team identifies potential vulnerabilities in emerging technologies including performance degradation in contested environments, interoperability, adaptability and training/ease of use through live experiment venues.</p>
<p>After reviewing the technology demonstration paper submissions, the Government may invite select candidates to participate in an ART/TSOA assessment venue in which we evaluate the capability as applied to the Warfighter, its technical limitations and vulnerabilities through an enemy perspective. These assessments will be held quarterly at various venues to include, but not limited to, Camp Dawson, WV, Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, CA, Marine Corps Base Quantico, VA, Ft. Hood, TX, Fort AP Hill, VA, Joint Base Lewis-McCord, WA, Camp Atterbury, IN, Stennis, MS and Port Canaveral, FL through 31 December 2017. These assessments will provide the submitter an opportunity to interact with the Warfighter, the DoD Science and Technology community, academia, Combatant Commands (COCOMS), Theater Special Operations Commands (TSOCs) and other federal agencies for the purpose of assessing potential impact of emerging technology solutions on missions and capabilities.</p>
<p>Technology Demonstration papers shall be submitted electronically to email address: usarmy.belvoir.rdecom-cerdec.mbx.nvesd-art-tsoa-submissions@mail.mil. The subject line of the email must indicate ART/TSOA, followed by the submitting organization's name. This RFI is effective through 31 December 2017. Technology demonstration papers may be submitted at any time during the effective periods but specific event cut-off dates are listed below, and an indication of which event the submission is for is needed.</p>
<p>B. OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>(1) Background: The ART/TSOA conducts quarterly assessments funded by ASA(ALT) to support the vulnerability identification and system limitation in contested environments for emerging capabilities in an operationally relevant venue. These assessments are conducted with representatives from Government Research and Development (R&amp;D) organizations, academia, and industry. The assessments provide an opportunity for technology developers to interact with operational personnel and determine how their efforts might support military capability gaps and high priority mission deficiencies. The environment facilitates a collaborative working relationship between academia, Government, and industry and supports identification, assessment, and dissemination of emerging and mature technology information and the acceleration of delivering capabilities to the Warfighters and those they support. The assessment results are reported back to the program director on a quarterly basis.</p>

Specifically, the Government will issue a modification extending continued maintenance and support of Oracle licenses procured in support of the Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application (AHLTA), Composite Health Care System (CHCS), Theatre Medical Information Program - Joint (TMIP-J), Enterprise Blood Management System (EBMS), Health Artifact and Image Management Solution (HAIMS), and Joint Operational Medicine Information System (JOMIS), Vienna Develop Test facility, and Develop Test &amp; Evaluation (DT&amp;E) facilities.<br />Only one brand is capable of continuing to provide the supplies or services required at the level or quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized. Only Oracle meet the Government's requirements and market research indicates other companies similar products or services, lack the particular features, or capabilities, and do not meet, or cannot meet the agency's needs.</p>
<p>THIS IS AN EXTENSION OF THE CURRENT SERVICES UNTIL THE GOVERNMENT CAN RE-COMPETE A NEW PROCUREMENT.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this requirement is 511210 and FSC 7035.</p>
<p>USAMRAA intends to issue a contract modification no sooner than 15 days after publishing this synopsis. This Special Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive quotes. Information received in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether a competitive procurement is in the best interest of the Government. If no written<br />responses are received by the date listed below, which reflects at least fifteen (15) days after the publication of this notice, the modification will be issued as sole source.</p>
<p>All questions and responses concerning this notice shall be emailed to Ayi Ayayi at<br />ayi.j.ayayi.civ@mail.mil.</p>
<p>Interested concerns must identify their capability in writing to the email address listed above no later than 4:00 PM ET, 24 November 2016.</p>

<p>In June 2012, OMB released a Digital Strategy for the US government which requires feedback from the American public to be gathered, analyzed and reviewed to enhance Government programs and services to maximize interaction between the Government and the American public. In today's society, social media channels are one of the most reliable and popular methods to interact with targeted audiences and at DCD these channels are widely used to disseminate information related to the mission of HHS. Similarly, DCD utilizes several consumer engagement tactics to maximize interaction with the American public and the use of social network monitoring tools enables DCD to listen, monitor, and engage in online conversations about topics that are important to HHS and the Secretary.</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.

<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Academy located at the U.S. Marine Corps Base Quantico, VA consists of multiple facilities dating back to 1972 when the main Academy training buildings were initially constructed. Since 1972 many new buildings have been added. A number of these facilities have some form of fire alarm and or protective suppression system incorporated into the facility. These systems require continuous maintenance as directed by Federal, State and Local mandated requirements.
<p>Several of the facilities fire protective systems have been renovated. Five of the larger facilities have integrated new main fire panels with existing older panels. The majority of academy panels report alarms and system troubles to a Kingfisher manufactured transponder panel which communicates directly with the Quantico Marine Corp Fire Department and the FBI Communications Center for EMS notification.<br /><br /></p>

<DESC>The Government anticipates the extension of the Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) Battle Command System (IBCS) Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase. This effort will align the IBCS EMD phase activities with the most recent Acquisition Program Baseline. The contract award period will be from date of contract award to 31&nbsp;May 2017.
<p><br />The Government anticipates this effort to be awarded on a sole source basis to Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation, 213 Wynn Drive, Huntsville, AL 35805-1958, CAGE 9F909. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(A) and (B); however, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>Northrop Grumman is the Original Equipment Manufacturer and sole developer for the IBCS. The IBCS is still in the EMD phase, as such, NG maintains the knowledge, skilled labor force, and detailed technical data concerning the manufacturing processes, system operations, and detailed software/hardware designs necessary to perform the critical engineering and integration activities associated with the IBCS. A technical data package is not available at this time.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOLICITATION NOTICE. TO LOCATE THE SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS LINKED TO THIS SOLICIATION NOTICE YOU MUST GO TO THE ORIGINAL SOLICITATION NO. GS00Q-13-DR-0002 MODIFICATION&nbsp;2 AT FBO.GOV FOUND HERE:
<p><a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?mode=form&amp;id=a98c8d5d0598988c2d639cf522dd8d67&amp;tab=ntype">https://www.fbo.gov/index?mode=form&amp;id=a98c8d5d0598988c2d639cf522dd8d67&amp;tab=ntype</a></p>
<p>OASIS Small Business (SB) was originally solicited under solicitation number GS00Q-13-DR-0002 through Amendment No. 11. Original awards were made and a notice to proceed on those contracts was issued on June 20, 2014.</p>
<p>This solicitation notice is for a re-opening of solicitation GS00Q-13-DR-0002 (Modification 2) in order to conduct an open season on-ramp in accordance with Section H.15.3 of the original solicitation.</p>
<p>This open season on-ramp is specific to Pool 2 only. The original intent was to award 40 contractors in Pool 2; however, there are only 9 contract awardees in Pool 2. This procurement action intends to add 31 more multiple award contractors to the existing OASIS SB Pool 2.<br /><br />IMPORTANT NOTE: An on-ramp solicitation is not a new procurement and operates differently than a new solicitation. An on-ramp solicitation is a result of the provisions established in the original solicitation and is issued as a solicitation amendment to the original solicitation. The terms and conditions of the original solicitation require that "the award decision under the open season solicitation is based upon substantially the same evaluation factors/sub-factors as the original solicitation." Additionally, the terms and conditions of the original solicitation require that, "The terms and conditions of any resulting awards are materially identical to the existing version of the OASIS SB Pool." Accordingly, while the Government will entertain suggestions and Industry input regarding the on-ramp solicitation amendment, the Government anticipates very little change to result from this input, especially as it regards any potential changes to the evaluation factors, scoring methodology, or resulting terms and conditions. <br /><br />The FBO.gov system does not have the capability to properly issue solicitation notices for on-ramp solicitation amendments. To address this system limitation, we have created this solicitation notice to trigger notification and act as a placeholder for this on-ramp. This solicitation notification alerts you to the Government's intent and directs you to the formal solicitation amendment that has been recently posted at the original solicitation site. The final solicitation amendment will be posted to Federal Business Opportunities under solicitation number GS00Q-13-DR-0002 Modification 2. Any further changes to the FINAL solicitation amendment will also be posted to the same location.</p>
<p>This solicitation notice, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 5.204, is posted by the General Services Administration (GSA), Federal Acquisition Service (FAS) to announce the issuance of&nbsp;a Request for Proposal (RFP) for One Acquisition Solution for Integrated Services (OASIS) Small Business (SB). This OASIS SB on-ramp is a Multiple Award (MA), Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) solicitation amendment issued as a 100% Small Business Set-Aside with partial set-asides for 8(a), SDVOSB, HUBZone, WOSB, and EDWOSB companies.</p>
<p>SCOPE OF WORK:<br /><br />The Solicitation is designed to address the need for a full range of service requirements that integrate multiple professional service disciplines and ancillary services/products with the flexibility for all contract types and pricing at the task order level. The services to be provided under the OASIS SB MA-IDIQ solicitation are intended to meet the professional service mission requirements of all Federal agencies, including all organizations within the Department of Defense (DoD) and National Security Community. The scope of OASIS SB spans many areas of expertise and includes any and all components required to formulate a total solution to a professional services based requirement.</p>
<p>The ordering period for contracts awarded in association with this OASIS SB Pool 2 on ramp will be congruent with existing OASIS SB Pool 2 contract holders (from the date of the Notice-To-Proceed through June 19, 2019). Identical to the current OASIS SB Pool 2 contracts, there will be one (5-year) option that may extend the cumulative ordering period of the contract to June 19, 2024. Once the OASIS SB MA-IDIQ Pool 2 on-ramp is awarded, task orders will be issued and awarded in accordance with FAR 16.505 procedures.</p>
<p>This on-ramp is a 100% Total Small Business Set-Aside with partial set-asides for 8(a), SDVOSB, HUBZone, WOSB, and EDWOSB companies.</p>
<p>This notice is to conduct a Total Small Business Set-Aside under an OASIS SB Pool 2 on-ramp with the ability to do Socio-Economic Set-Asides at the Task Order level. OASIS SB has a multi-NAICS code/multiple Small Business Size Standard structure. For Pool 2, this solicitation Small Business Size Standard is $20.5 Million and covers the following North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code industries:</p>
<p>541720 - Research and Development in the Social Sciences and Humanities<br />541211 - Offices of Certified Public Accountants<br />541213 - Tax Preparation Services<br />541214 - Payroll Services<br />541219 - Other Accounting Services</p>
<p>OTHER: The solicitation amendment will only be available for download through the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website located under Solicitation No. GS00Q-13-DR-0002 Modification 2. Offerors are responsible for downloading the solicitation amendment documents and for monitoring FBO for changes or additional information. All interested Offerors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to receiving an award. You may access SAM at https://www.sam.gov</p>
<p>QUESTIONS:&nbsp; Once the final solicitation amendment is issued, questions and answers will be posted to the GS00Q-13-DR-0002 site. Any and all questions regarding this notification should be directed to the OASIS SB Contracting Officer Valerie Bindel via email at oasisSB@gsa.gov.</p>

<DESC>Langley Research Center (LaRC) seeks organizations which demonstrate the ability to supply a reflected solar instrument calibrated to the rigorous accuracy standards of the CLARREO Pathfinder Mission. Providing the reflected solar instrument is one important component; however, an equally important component is to provide the calibration capability and expertise that achieves the required measurement accuracy.
<p>The CLARREO Pathfinder Mission will demonstrate essential technologies and associated measurements from space necessary for future high-accuracy, long-term climate change trend observations. Pathfinder's success depends heavily upon the ability to develop a verifiable on-orbit Syst&egrave;me International d'Unit&eacute;s (SI)-traceable calibration to make highly accurate, spectrally-resolved measurements of Earth solar reflectance. CLARREO Pathfinder will also demonstrate the ability to transfer this calibration to other Earth-observing assets - such as the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) instruments and Visible-Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instruments - thereby improving the accuracy of those observations.</p>
<p>The instrument must meet International Space Station (ISS) program requirements to receive a Certificate of Flight (CoF) and be manifested to ISS. CLARREO Pathfinder will be a Class D mission per NPR 8705.4 and Category 3 per NPR 7120.5E. The anticipated launch readiness date is in the calendar year 2020-2021 timeframe. System performance requirements are provided in the following sections.<br />Reflected Solar (RS) Instrument<br />The primary data product from the RS instrument is Earth spectral reflectance. The following is a description of the necessary capabilities of the RS instrument:<br />&bull; The instrument shall have calibrated spectral response spanning at least 350 to 2300 nm. <br />&bull; The instrument spectral sampling shall be at least 4 nm sampling and 8 nm resolution.<br />&bull; The instrument shall acquire on-orbit SI-traceable spectrally-resolved Earth reflectances referenced to spectral solar irradiance with average uncertainty &lt;= 0.3% (k=1) for the 350 - 2300 nm wavelength range.<br />&bull; The instrument shall acquire on-orbit SI-traceable broadband (350 - 2300 nm) spectrally-integrated Earth reflectance with uncertainty &lt;= 0.3% (k=1), with spectral accuracy weighted using global average Earth spectrally reflected energy.<br />&bull; The instrument polarization sensitivity to a 100% polarized input shall be &lt; 0.50% (k=2) in wavelength from 350 nm to 2300 nm. <br />&bull; The instrument shall have pointing capability to allow it to match the view in time, space, and viewing angle of sensors being inter-calibrated (e.g., CERES and VIIRS) and to view the sun and moon.<br />&bull; The instrument shall have the ability to collect Earth, Sun and Moon observations with a pointing accuracy &le; 0.025 degrees.<br />&bull; The CLARREO Reflected Solar Pathfinder instrument shall have a geo-located nadir field-of-view &lt; 0.5 km with a swath width of &ge; 70 km.<br />&bull; The CLARREO Pathfinder prime mission operations period shall be 12 months following on-orbit commissioning.</p>
<p><br />ISS program requirements<br />Environmental and interface requirements derive from the following assumptions: The CLARREO Pathfinder RS payload will be launched upon a commercial resupply vehicle to the ISS. The CLARREO Pathfinder RS payload will be robotically installed as an externally-attached payload on the ISS at Expedite the PRocessing of Experiments to Space Station (ExPRESS), ExPRESS Logistics Carrier (ELC)-1, at the Passive Flight Releasable Attachment Mechanism (FRAM) Adapter Plate 3 (PFAP 3).<br />Governing documents:<br />General useful information, including the external payloads proposers' guide that describes ISS accommodations (pallets, power, thermal, field of view, microgravity, electromagnetics, etc.), integration, launch vehicle, flight and ground safety, and ISS provided hardware, are available here: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/facilities_category/index.html<br />ISS Flight Releasable Attachment Mechanism (FRAM) based payload common requirements are contained in NASA SSP 57012.<br />ISS flight safety requirements are contained in the following documents:<br />1. Safety Policy and requirements for payloads using ISS NASA NSTS 1700.7B w/ NASA NSTS 1700.7B ISS Addendum as a guide (available by request)<br />2. Interpretation of NSTS/ISS payload safety requirements NSTS/ISS 18798 (available by request)<br />3. ISS safety requirements document NASA SSP 50021 (available by request)<br />4. Safety review process NASA SSP 30599 (available by request)<br />5.

<p>Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the Lawrence Livermore National Security (LLNS), LLC under contract no. DE-AC52-07NA27344 (Contract 44) with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">is offering the opportunity to further develop and commercialize its additively manufacturing bio-based conductive shape memory polymer macrostructure parts.</span>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">The technical challenge of 3D printing shape memory polymers is the chemistry and the rheology of the materials chosen for the shape memory polymer system. Dropjet printing of Newtonian polymers requires curing upon each layer in order to build up the printed part. This requires a UV curable system. This can be achieved either with acrylate or epoxy systems. Acrylate systems are traditionally weak. Epoxy systems require inert atmosphere while curing. 3D printing via stereolithography also requires a UV curable system, which results in similar issues as the dropjet 3D systems. Additive manufacturing via Fused deposition modeling involves the melt extrusion of thermoplastic polymers which harden at room temperature. These printed parts are inherently weak due to their thermoplastic polymer chemistry. Alternatively, 3D printing via direct ink write (DIW) requires that the ink be freestanding, which is achieved with non-Newtonian materials. This requires that the materials to be printed via DIW be either filled with a particulate or pre-cured to achieve the proper rheological conditions for printing.</span>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">LLNL researchers have developed a novel method of 3D printing regular microstructured architectures and subsequent complex macrostructures from additively manufactured bio-based composite thermoset shape memory polymer composite materials<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">. </strong>This technology for 3D additively manufactured parts utilizes up to a 4 axis control DIW system for fabricating bio&shy; based thermally cured epoxy based SMP carbon nano-fiber composite parts.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">Beyond the proposed printed micro-structure, LLNL inventors have also developed a manufacturing process which allows for not only multi-functional materials to be printed within a single part (printing materials that exhibit shape memory at different temperatures in specific areas of the part), but also the ability to reform macro-structures after a preliminary partial cure, in which the parts maintain the micro-structure and their shape memory behavior.</span></p>

This material is the first reported SMP polymeric system that has the ability to be partially cured post DIW printing and reformed into a different macro structure, while maintaining its shape memory properties. This material is free standing and able to span gaps, therefore can be used for foam like micro-structures, which can then be formed into macro-structures. With either proposed processing, these materials maintain their shape memory behavior.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought for information and planning purposes. Naval Supply Systems Command (NAVSUP) Fleet Logistics Center (FLC) Norfolks intent of this announcement is to identify qualified and experienced sources for a contract vehicle that will provide one- stop training and sustainment package for autonomous Static Line and Military Free Fall parachute insertion capabilities IAW NTTP 3-02.5 as defined in the attached draft Performance Work Statement. This announcement constitutes a sources sought for written information only. This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and a contract will not be awarded from this announcement. This announcement is not to be construed in any way as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response.

Anticipated NAICS Code
The NAICS Code for this requirement is 532411- Commercial Air, Rail and Water Transportation Equipment Rental and Leasing and the Size Standard is $32.5 million.
 Respondents should provide their business size for this NAICS Code. The Government has not yet determined whether an existing strategically sourced vehicle will be used to satisfy this requirement. 

Reponses to this Sources Sought request should reference N00189-17-R-0009 and shall include the following information in this format: 

1. Company name, address, point of contact name, phone number, fax number and email address. 

2. Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) Code.

3. If the services can be solicited from a GSA schedule, provide the GSA contract number.

Please also include in past performance information the contract numbers, dollar value, and period of performance for each contract referenced in the response to this sources sought.

9. The Government is still determining the acquisition strategy and if this acquisition will be a small business set-aside, then FAR clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, applies.
 Note that if there is sufficient demonstrated interest and capability among small businesses, a key factor in determining if an acquisition will be a small business set-aside is that two or more potential small business prime contractors must be capable of performing at least 50% of the effort, as defined in FAR clause 52.219-14.

If it is determined that a small business set-aside is appropriate and your company anticipates submitting a proposal as the prime contractor for a small business set-aside, please provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, and if subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of the effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large business subcontractors will be used.
 Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided.

10. Include any other supporting documentation.

11. Comments or suggested changes to the Governments NAICS Determination.

12.Identify conditions or issues the U.S. Government should consider or may interfere with the intention of this project.

Documentation of technical expertise must be presented in sufficient detail for the Government to determine that your company possesses the necessary functional area expertise and experience to compete for this acquisition. Standard company brochures will not be reviewed. Submissions are not to exceed five (5) typewritten pages in no less than 12 font size.

<DESC>Space and Naval Warfare System Center (SPAWARSYSCEN) Atlantic has a requirement to provide professional engineering services in support of the Fixed Very Low Frequency/Low Frequency (FVLF/LF) transmitter and antenna systems. The contractor will be required to provide engineering services on an on call basis to conduct analysis and to identify/implement solutions for the FVLF/LF transmitter and antenna system problems created by design deficiencies, equipment obsolesce or technical changes which have resulted in a degraded reliability or in less than optimum performance.
The FVLF/LF transmitting stations provide the primary broadcast communications link for the command and control of Strategic Submarine Ballistic Nuclear (SSBN) and Strategic Submarine Nuclear (SSN) submarines making it part of the Nuclear Command and Control Communications (NC3) architecture. Those stations were designed and constructed at various times over the past six decades.  Consequently, each is unique and all are subject to problems peculiar to particular stations requiring the employment of consultants well versed in highly specialized areas of FVLF/LF transmitter, antenna, and antenna network theoretical and applications engineering. Timely solution to problems as they develop is necessary to ensure reliable communications to fleet commanders in command and control of submarines.
This is a pre-solicitation notice, and the Government anticipates that a formal solicitation will be issued in December 2016 as a 100% Small Business Set Aside.

<DESC><strong>PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE ONLY FOR CLR039A CP#1 CONSTRUCTION OF LRDR MISSION CONTROL FACILITY AT CLEAR AIR FORCE STATION, ALASKA. OFFERS OR PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED FOR THIS NOTICE.<br /></strong><br />CONTRACT INFORMATION: This is a pre-solicitation notice for a single phase,&nbsp;UNRESTRICTED Request for Proposal (RFP) for the construction of a Mission Control Facility (MCF) greater than 50,000 sq. ft. including site development and infrastructure.

Response date of 13 January 2017 is based on issuance of the RFP on or about 30 November 2016. <br /><br />The procurement will be conducted using single phase source selection procedures and the award will be based on the best overall value to the Government considering the non-price factors described in the RFP, and price. The Government will evaluate proposals in accordance with the evaluation rating systems outlined in the selection procedures of the RFP and will utilize the Tradeoff Process described in FAR 15.101-1. Any resulting contract will be firm fixed price. The anticipated Notice to Proceed date is May 2017 with a period of performance of 530 calendar days. Offerors are advised that a contract resulting from this solicitation is subject to the availability of funds. Should Congress not appropriate funds, the solicitation will be cancelled.

We advise contractors to begin this process when they prepare their proposal in order to ensure this registration is in place should they be selected for the award.

If a PLA propoal is accepted by the Government, the awardee will be required to execute a PLA with one or more appropriate labor organizations for the tem of the resulting contract.<br /><br />The overall evaluation of the non-price factors is considered significantly more important than price.<br /><br />OBTAINING THE SOLICITATION: The solicitation will be available electronically from FedBizOpps website (www.fbo.gov).
