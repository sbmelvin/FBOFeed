Authority:  10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).   Supplies or services required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Therefore, the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.   Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
In accordance with FAR 52.225-3, Buy American Act - Free Trade Agreements, one or more of these items under this acquisition is subject to the Free Trade Agreement. 	 Based upon market research the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Governments requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.  No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation.  Hard copies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office.  The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.  
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement  make contact with the firm(s) listed.
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set-aside).  Foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could if otherwise eligible participate as subcontractor(s).
Due to the complexity and criticality of this part, only actual manufactures or approved suppliers that have successfully completed all testing required by the original company responsible (OEM) and have successfully completed all testing on items determined by the government to be similar in complexity and criticality can be considered approved sources for this item.
An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from Offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241.  DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. 
22.	UID:  If unit price exceeds $5,000.00 then UID requirements will apply.

<DESC>DLA Land and Maritime is issuing a solicitation in support of HMMWV Industrial Based Production Programs. The current ILP contract expires January 18, 2014. This is a follow on contract to continue full support at Red River Army Depot (RRAD) with a limited support and Letterkenny Army Depot (LEAD). This contract will be a Requirements Type Contract estimated to be from January 19, 2014 through September 30, 2014. At the end of the contract term, the Government reserves the right to extend the contract in increments of 30 days for transitioning to organic support. While the contract may be extended more than once, the total extension of performance shall not exceed six (6) months. The awardee will function as a Prime Services Integrator (PSI ) for three separately described but integrated services required to effectively and efficiently support the HMMWV industrial production programs: 1) Repair parts, components and kits support to accomplish the required repairs and upgrades; 2) Technical support to apply best manufacturing and repair practices to any Full or Tailored Implementation Sites, currently RRAD which is a full implementation site and LEAD which is a tailored site; and 3) Operation of a dual supply system for replenishing (i.e. "pushing") the required parts using proven just-in-time supply practices. <br /><br />A part of this program, the Contractor is required to requisition the parts specified in Section B as Government 1st Sourced from DLA on a "fill or pass" basis to satisfy their forecasted inventory requirements. Each part/NSN provided under this contract has a primary source assignment- either Gov't. 1st Source (all parts on the contract that are not sole source to AMG items) or AMG 1st Source (all AMG sole source items. The dual supply system is activated if Gov't 1st source parts are not available because DLA does not have inventory available to support the quantities required. Only under these circumstances, will Contractor be authorized to procure these parts from an outside source up to the requisitioned requirement and provide them to the Government at the agreed to prices as listed on the attached Parts Price list in Section B. The dual system of supply is an emergency safety measure to prevent stock-outs (parts not available when the mechanic reaches for it) or in some cases a Production Shut Down/Line Stopper and is not the normal course of action.
<p>This dual supply system requires the contractor to price every item being supplied under this contract and to have the capability to supply Government first sourced parts with little or no lead time. The measurable goal of acquiring these parts and services is to produce a better product to the field, faster and at a lower cost.</p>
<p>The Statutory Authority permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition for this action is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as cited in FAR 6.302-1. It has been determined by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) that AM General LLC, 105 Niles Avenue, South Bend, IN 46617, as the developer and sole manufacturer of the HMMWV, is the only firm with the technical expertise and in-place logistics system necessary to meet the requirements of this solicitation. In an effort to provide maximum opportunities for small businesses, women-owned small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses; DLA would continue to serve as the first source of supply for all parts on the contract that are not sole source to AM General.</p>
<p>This acquisition is for a requirements type contract to include functional support services as well as parts support for any HMMWV part for any HMMWV variant, both current and future. The initial population of items to be priced is approximately 2856 items in support of the Army industrial based production programs at RRAD and LEAD. Additional parts may be added as needed. The schedule of supplies for these approximate 2,856 items will be provided as an attachment to the solicitation.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide functional support services for items on the contract. This will include:</p>
<p>(1) Supply of proprietary and non-proprietary items</p>
<p>(2) Management of inventory</p>
<p>(3) Forecasting customer requirements and "pushing" supplies to the production line</p>
<p>(4) System engineering and technical support</p>
<p>(5) Synchronize supply distribution to meet depot and operational requirements</p>
<p>(6) Rapid response manufacturing for priority requirements</p>
<p>(7) Kitting of identified items as required</p>
<p>(8) Recommend improvements to maximize production line efficiency</p>
<p>The contractor will store and maintain title to contractor owned inventory until the point of consumption by the customer. The stock will be held at either Government locations or Contractor warehouses near depot production sites, currently at RRAD and LEAD. As the contractor will maintain ownership of the stock until consumption, the contractor will be responsible for maintaining a discrete level of safety stock suitable to prevent stock outs. The contractor will have visibility of stock attrition to effectively plan and ramp up and forecast the requirements. The contractor will also store, manage, and forecast inventory for Government sourced parts, with the Government retaining title to the inventory until point of consumption.</p>
<p>This procurement will be made on an All or None basis to streamline processes. This will also help to ensure award is made to a sole qualified contractor with experience and capability providing these parts and to serve as a complete prime system integrator. It is again important to note that the demands supported by this procurement are over and above "normal" operational requirements.</p>
<p>Solicitations will be issued upon request.</p>

<DESC>NASA/JSC has an increased requirement for services in support of the WB-57F Airborne Imaging and Recording System (AIRS) and associated engineering, fabrication, and program management and support services for research, development, integration, analysis, assessment, test, maintenance, repair, and evaluation of sensor systems in support of NASAs aircraft programs including the WB-57 aircraft. Tasks performed under this contract include technology development, systems acquisition, mission planning, operations, and product support for sensors, systems, and platforms. &lt;p&gt; NASA/JSC intends to purchase these services from Southern Research Institute (SRI) on a sole-source basis by increasing the maximum not-to-exceed value of the current contract by $9,000,000.00. The AIRS hardware and software used in support of these sensors, systems, and platforms was developed by Southern Research Institute. This hardware and software requires system engineering in relation to mission planning of which SRI has been the sole provider. In addition, the hardware associated with these sensors and systems contains software and algorithms that were developed solely by SRI and are proprietary to SRI. Because the software is constantly changing due to operational requirements, SRI has developed procedures and tools used to operate the software. This unique expertise is critical to the integrity of the software. For this reason, SRI is considered the only source with the specialized knowledge and data rights necessary to fulfill the Governments requirements. &lt;p&gt; The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. &lt;p&gt; Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on November 12, 2013.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

Responses should be no longer than 15 pages in length. Responses should be sent via email to Valerie Whipple, Contracting Officer, at valerie.whipple@nrc.gov.</p>
<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this procurement is 541990. The anticipated period of performance will be up to 5 years.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The NRC is responsible for the licensing and regulatory oversight of civilian nuclear power reactors in the United States. The NRC implements regulations and develops and implements policies, programs, and procedures pertaining to all aspects of licensing and inspection of these facilities.</p>
<p>The NRC Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation (NRR) is responsible for contributing to the regulatory mission of the NRC by providing lead in all licensing and inspection activities associated with the operation of existing nuclear power reactors and research and test reactor. NRR conducts a broad range of regulatory activities in the four primary program areas of rulemaking, licensing, oversight, and incident response for commercial nuclear power reactors, and test and research reactors to protect the public health, safety, and the environment.</p>
<p>Division of Safety Systems (DSS) of NRR provides nuclear plant systems-related analysis to assess the regulatory and technical appropriateness of the changes to existing licenses (Technical Specification, TS) including amendments, exceptions and applications for new facilities or designs. This analysis focuses on plant safety-related (primary and secondary systems) and non-safety related systems (containment, ventilation and balance of plant), in-core performance of fuel, clad and fuel assembly, core physics, and core thermal hydraulic performance. DSS provides expertise for other related purposes such as specific safety issue resolution, specific inspections, and incident response. Also, DSS develops programs and guidelines to improve generic technical specifications and provides interpretations of technical specification requirements.</p>
<p>Nuclear Performance and Code Review Branch (SNPB) of DSS is responsible for the review of transients and accident analyses that evaluates the thermal, mechanical and material design of the fuel system. The fuel system consists of arrays (assemblies or bundles) of fuel rods, including fuel pellets, insulator pellets, springs, tubular cladding, end closures, hydrogen getters, and fill gas; burnable poison rods including components similar to those in fuel rods; spacer grids and springs; end plates; channel boxes; and reactivity control rods. SNPB maintains the ability to review thermal-hydraulic and fuel performance related computer code models for operating reactors, together with the necessary staff technical expertise to run the models.</p>
<p>The fuel system safety review provides assurance that (1) the fuel system is not damaged as a result of normal operation and anticipated operational occurrences (AOOs), (2) fuel system damage is never so severe as to prevent control rod insertion when it is required, (3) the number of fuel rod failures is not underestimated for postulated accidents, and (4) coolability is always maintained. General Design Criterion (GDC) 10, within Appendix A to 10 CFR Part 50, also addresses item 1 above. Specifically, GDC 10 establishes specified acceptable fuel design limits (SAFDLs) that should not be exceeded during any condition of normal operation, including the effects of AOOs. Therefore, the SAFDLs are established to ensure that the fuel is not damaged, i.e., the fuel rods do not fail, fuel system dimensions remain within operational tolerances, and functional capabilities are not reduced below those assumed in the safety analysis. Standard Review Plan (SRP) (NUREG-0800) Section 4.2 describes all fuel design and damage criteria.</p>
<p>Acceptance criteria fuel system design should meet the relevant regulatory requirements identified in SRP Section 4.2. Though compliance with SRP Section 4.2 is not required since SRP is not a substitute for NRC's regulations, the applicant is required to identify differences between the design features, analytical techniques, and procedural measures proposed for its methodology/facility and the SRP acceptance criteria and evaluate how the proposed alternatives to the SRP acceptance criteria provide acceptable methods of compliance with NRC regulations.</p>
<p>SRP Chapter 15.0.2 provides guidance for transient and accident analyses methodology. This guidance can be extended to review of analytical models and computer codes used for other safety related areas, such as, in-core fuel performance methodology and computer code. SRP Chapter 15.0.2 provides acceptance criteria in the areas (i) Documentation, (ii) Evaluation model, (iii) Accident scenario identification process, (iv) Code assessment, (v) Uncertainty analysis, and (vi) Quality assurance plan. Acceptance criteria for these areas are listed in Section II of Chapter 15.0.2 of SRP. Detailed procedures for acceptance and detailed review are provided in Chapter 15.0.2, Section III of SRP. The reviewer for nuclear safety related methodology and code should document all findings in an evaluation model safety evaluation report (SER) that either accepts the evaluation model for the intended use or rejects the evaluation model. Acceptance may be subject to limitations determined during the review. If the evaluation model is to be accepted, it must be clearly demonstrated that the model is getting the right answer for the right reasons. The review process and the results of communications with the submitted code must also be documented as appropriate in the SER to provide a traceable history of the review process. Restrictions and limitations on use of the evaluation model must be explicitly documented in the SER. The SER must document areas that were reviewed, the method of review, and the findings in each area. The SER must also document areas that were not reviewed and provide the reasons for their omission.</p>
<p>The specific regulations that establish criteria for fuel performance methodology and computer codes are (i) 10 CFR 50.46, 10 CFR 50.34, and 10 CFR 50.67 as they relate to cooling performance analysis of the emergency core cooling system (ECCS) using an acceptable evaluation model and establishing acceptance criteria for light water nuclear power ECCS and analysis and evaluation of the design and performance of structures, systems and components (SSC) of the facility with the objective of assessing the risk to public health and safety resulting from operation of the facility, (ii) 10 CFR 100 and 10 CFR 67, as they relate to determining the acceptability of a reactor site based on calculating the exposure to an individual as a result of fission product releases to the environment following a major accident scenario, (iii) GDC 10 as it relates to assuring that SAFDLs are not exceeded assuring that SAFDLs are not exceeded during any condition of normal operation, including the effects of AOOs, and (iv) GDC 27, as it relates to the reactivity control system being designed with appropriate margin and, in conjunction with the ECCS, being capable of controlling reactivity and cooling under post-accident conditions.</p>
<p>The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) has been providing technical assistance to the Division of Safety Systems in the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation (NRR) in the area of fuel rod thermal-mechanical design and methodology for Boiling Water Reactors (BWR) and Pressurized Water Reactors. A typical fuel performance methodology and computer code submittal includes fuel rod evaluation methodology, SRP compliance, criterion for normal operation and AOOs, uncertainty analyses, PWR and BWR applications, and code calibration and validation.</p>
<p>Capability Sought</p>
<p>The NRC is seeking to identify commercial organizations capable of providing technical assistance in reviewing methodology and computer code for the realistic evaluation of the thermal-mechanical performance of fuel rods for BWRs and PWRs. The methodology and the computer code are applicable to the following fuel rod characteristics:<br /><br />&bull; Fuel rods containing UO2, gadolinia-bearing UO2, or mixed oxide (MOX) fuel pellets,<br />&bull; PWR fuel rods fabricated with M5&reg; or Zircaly-4 cladding, and<br />&bull; BWR fuel rods fabricated with Zircaloy-2 cladding in either the recrystallization annealed (RX) or stress-relief annealed (SR) condition.<br /><br />The second component of the realistic thermal-mechanical fuel rod performance methodology is the application of the code for evaluating the behavior of rods under normal operation and accident conditions. The methodology used in the code evaluates scenarios for normal operation and transients to quantify the margins relative to the design criteria in a statistical manner. The uncertainties considered in the methodology spans over the projected range of fuel operation for the fuel rods for parameters, such as, power histories, manufactured fuel rod parameter uncertainties, and the computer code model uncertainties. The statistical methodology that is employed in the analysis of fuel rod performance during normal operating and AOO conditions for a given fuel reload at any given power plant will show that the fuel meets the design criteria with a quantified probability. The methodology employs a random sampling of the power, manufacturing, and model uncertainties, similar to Monte Carlo method with the best-estimate code in conjunction with non-parametric statistics to evaluate the propagation of the uncertainties to the design analysis results.</p>
<p>In order to calibrate and validate the fuel performance code and methodology results, the TR simulates the complex behavior of fuel rod and assesses a number of performance measures. Code calibration involves iteration between interrelated models to obtain an acceptable best-estimate prediction of the measured data. Validation of the code demonstrates that all aspects of the fuel rod behavior subject to fuel design criteria are well predicted in a best-estimate manner over the entire range of database. This means the validation process assures consistency between models by demonstrating that the interrelated fuel behavior for the different sets of test data is accurately predicted.</p>
<p>The TR provides application examples to demonstrate the realistic fuel rod analysis methodology for several BWR and PWR reactors under normal operating conditions and transients. These cases are selected to demonstrate the code and methodology application for different cladding types, urania fuel, gadolinia-bearing fuel and MOX fuel over a wide range operating conditions.</p>
<p>This project requires a mixture of expertise in nuclear engineering, materials science and engineering nuclear plant operations, and statistics - i.e., individuals assigned to this project will need to have a combination of knowledge and experience in both nuclear power systems and nuclear, materials and mechanical aspects of in-core fuel performance in PWRs and BWR.

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;">This is a SMALL BUSINESS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of qualified small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses) that can provide performance measurement data reporting, data system maintenance, and support to the current SHIP National Performance Measurement and Reporting System (SHIP NPR). The SHIP NPR supports all 54 State Health Insurance Assistance Programs (SHIPs) their 3,100 local SHIP sponsoring sites, and the CMS Division of SHIP Relations (SHIP Grant Administrator). The SHIP NPR is a web based system which provides direct data entry from most states. However, about one-third of some states provide batch uploads from their states' proprietary systems. The SHIP NPR resides on CMS servers managed by an external contractor. The SHIP NPR application utilizes Object Oriented Programming, .NET, C#, Microsoft SQL Server 2008, Visual Studio 2005/2008/2010, Model view controller pattern, Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services, Microsoft Internet Information Service (IIS), and Microsoft Access.BACKGROUND</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">BACKGROUND:<br /><br />The State Health Insurance Assistance Program is a state-based program that offers local one-on-one counseling and assistance and outreach to people with Medicare and their caregivers. Through CMS funded grants directed to states, SHIPs provide free counseling and assistance via telephone and face-to-face interactive sessions, public education presentations and programs, outreach events, and media activities. CMS funds 54 SHIPs in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. In FY2013, the SHIP program was funded $45.1 million as a result of the federal sequestration budget. This includes direct grants to states and support contracts including the SHIP National Resource Center contract and the SHIP National Performance Measurement and Reporting contract.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The SHIP network is comprised of paid staff, approximately 3,100 local sponsoring organizations, and 14,500 counselors (approximately 57% of which are volunteers). CMS expects SHIPs to provide access to SHIP services to beneficiaries statewide; provide access at the local level; provide access to hard-to-reach populations; have a well-trained workforce (paid and volunteer); provide accurate and timely information to beneficiaries; participate in CMS education and communication activities; and report activities to CMS through an established CMS data system. In the grant year ending March 31, 2013, SHIPs provided one-on-one counseling to approximately 2.5 million people and over 82,000 public and media events.</p>

<CONTACT>Jason A. Gerloff, Contracting Officer, Phone 785-320-4197, Email jason.gerloff@fletc.dhs.gov
<DESC>Contracting Office Address: Department of Homeland Security, Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC), Bio-containment Procurement Branch, Procurement Division, 1980 Denison Ave., Suite 100, Manhattan, KS 66502
<p><strong>MARKET SURVEY/SOURCES SOUGHT</strong>: The Department of Homeland Security is identifying potential offerors with capabilities to be the prime or general contractor. The successful contractor will furnish all labor, material, supervision and equipment required for construction and renovation to construct the waste water thermal decontamination system at the Plum Island, NY, Animal Disease Center (PIADC).</p>
<p><strong>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS</strong>. Responses to this synopsis will be used as a market research tool to identify the number of small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, HUBZone, SDVO, or Women-Owned small businesses that might submit proposals as the prime/general contractor for this contract work. The NAICS code for this contract is 236220 - Laboratory Construction. The estimated cost of the contract is within the range of $25-million to $50-million. Anticipate posting of the solicitation is January 2014. A pre-proposal conference will be conducted on a date to be determined. Award is anticipated for&nbsp;April 2014.</p>
<p>The PIADC is a Department of Homeland Security Federal Laboratory and is a part of the Science and Technology Directorate of the Department. Since 1954, the Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC) has been protecting America's livestock from foreign animal diseases (FADs), which are diseases not present in the United States, such as foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). PIADC operates Biosafety Level-3 Agriculture (BSL-3Ag) and BSL-2 laboratory facilities and has state-of-the-art biosafety practices and procedures to prevent a disease organism from escaping into the environment, including stringent and rigorously observed safety measures within the laboratories themselves.</p>
<p>PIADC's mission can be grouped into three main categories: (1) diagnostics, (2) research and development, and (3) education. These missions are executed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and Animal and Plant Inspection Services (APHIS).</p>
<p>As a diagnostic facility, PIADC is capable of diagnosing foreign animal diseases (FADs) in addition to domestic animal diseases. PIADC runs between 22,000 and 35,000 diagnostic tests per year. The facility's research programs include developing diagnostic tools and preventatives (such as vaccines and antivirals) for FMD and other FADs affecting livestock. As an educational facility, PIADC has been instructing veterinarians in recognizing FADs since 1971. This is a unique national asset for Agro-defense and the only facility in the United States permitted to handle live FMD viruses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;There is a current need to replace the facility's existing waste water thermal decontamination system (WWTDS),</p>
<p>A fixed price contract to construct the waste water thermal decontamination system is anticipated. This contract will require construction of a new Bio-safety Level 3 Enhanced facility capable of decontaminating 65,000 gallons per day of raw sewage and animal waste. The decontamination system shall be a batch system using steam to heat the waste to 275 degrees Fahrenheit at 31 psig and holding the waste at that temperature and pressure for one hour. After treatment the waste shall be discharged to the sewage treatment plant at no more than 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Major components of the system to be provided as part of the construction include nominally 60,000 gallons of storage for holding waste prior to treatment, five 3300 gallon cook tanks, heat recovery heat exchangers to preheat the next batch of waste, sea water heat exchangers to achieve the final 80 degree Fahrenheit temperature, a solid separator system to remove the majority of un-digestible cellulose and non-organic solids, and a HEPA ventilation system for the facility. The facility will require information technology and security infrastructure to support a highly automated treatment system in a secure, monitored facility.<br /><br />The Government currently anticipates issuing a solicitation for construction of the WWTDS in January 2014. The Request for Proposals will provide specific information regarding the construction requirements for the new facility. It will also include factors that will be considered in determining a competitive range and eventual negotiation and award of a fixed price contract based on the procedures identified in FAR 15.101.</p>

The technology will enable use of Localizer Performance with Vertical Guidance (LPV) approach minima from published Area Navigation (RNAV) (GPS) approach procedures without using satellite or ground based augmentation systems. This technology will provide the military GPS positioning source to the aircraft's existing RNAV (GPS) or required navigation performance (RNP) RNAV system. It will also provide equivalent performance to the guidance quality requirements for an LPV-200 (objective) or LPV-250 (threshold) approach as defined by FAA AC 20-138C and RTCA DO-229D. <br />This technology is needed to support the Navy's worldwide requirements for landing ashore in adverse weather or conditions of restricted visibility, including divert, expeditionary, transit, and transport operations.<br />Companies working on or possessing such technology should address, at minimum, the capabilities of the technology in regard to availability, accuracy and integrity of GPS receiver position outputs, based on the received GPS signal in space. Companies should show performance equivalence to Space Based Augmentation System (SBAS). Companies should address capabilities to meet the hardware and software compliance requirements of LPV-200. The impact of M-Code will be of high interest. Companies should discuss how the technology would be integrated into existing military GPS receivers or into form fit replacement components. Processing requirements, including throughput and memory capacity are important areas to cover. If there are advantages to integration with other aircraft systems such as inertial sensors or altimeters, these should be addressed. Companies should include a rough order of magnitude cost and schedule estimate to complete integration of this technology into Navy aircraft. This estimate should break out what your company can do and what will be needed from other companies to complete the work. If your company has worked or is working in this area, address the source of funding and whether your company claims restricted data rights. Responses to this request for information (RFI) may be proprietary to the responding company. Clearly identify the proprietary elements of your technical solution. Business Information: Firms are encouraged to respond to this RFI via e-mail to Mr. Dan Gentry at the following address: william.gentry@navy.mil. Mr. Gentry can be reached by telephone at (301) 757-7069. Please do NOT submit classified information in your response. All responses to this announcement shall indicate their business size in accordance with the Small Business Administration (SBA) Standard. Please ensure that your submission provides your company's name, address, cage code, and point of contact with e-mail address and telephone number. Please prepare your response in Adobe Portable Document Format or a Microsoft WORD or compatible format. Your submission shall not exceed seven (7) single-sided, single-spaced pages utilizing Times New Roman 12 point font with a minimum of one inch margins. Please submit your response to Mr. Gentry no later than 26 November 2013.
<p><br />THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. It is not a Request for Proposal, a Request for Quotation, an Invitation for Bids, a solicitation, or an indication that the NAVAIR will contract for anything related to this technology. Respondents submit information at their own risk; submission of a response to this request will not obligate the Government in any manner. The Government will not reimburse the respondent for any cost associated with the information submitted in response to this request. Proprietary or restricted information shall be marked as such and will be protected and only used for the purposes of analyzing your response.</p>

<DESC>The VA Boston Healthcare System (VABHS) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 -- Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements with Spectrum surgical instruments  for Laparoscopic insulation tester. This requirement will include the following characteristics: 
Product Description
T Portable, hand held Insulation Tester features a heavy-duty, shock-resistant case, includes all accessories and operates on a single 9-volt battery. A storage case is included. In addition, the device has received FDA 510(k) approval. The device assists in locating potentially dangerous tears and cracks along the shaft and handle of the laparoscopic instruments.  Laparoscopes are constantly used within the OR to perform surgical procedures. The devices are cleaned after every use and this could result in tears or wear on the insulation tubing. Some tears can be seen though simple observation but the Insulation tester would serve as a verification instrument for any tears that are not easily seen or missed by the surgical team. The service is essential to the Technicians, nurses, doctors, and others to ensure effectiveness and efficacy.

Salient Characteristics
Portable, hand held Insulation Tester features a heavy-duty, shock-resistant case, includes all accessories and operates on a single 9-volt battery. A storage case is included. In addition, the device has received FDA 510(k) approval.


This Notice of Intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. Parties may identify their interest, accompanied by supporting literature, to the Contracting Officer no later than 10/30/2013. Responses should be sent to torben.ohlsson@va.gov. Information received will be for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. The determination to conduct a competitive procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.

It is the contractor's responsibility to resolve any problems associated with these efforts.

3. LOCAL EXCHANGE SERVICE CIRCUITS
3.1. Point-to-Point Circuits.  Refers to a connection restricted to two endpoints.  A traditional point-to-point circuit is a communications medium with exactly two endpoints. The host equipment at either end has to take full responsibility for formatting the data transmitted between the two end points. Point to Point circuits will not extend beyond the Local Access and Transport Area (LATA) or state line boundary.

3.2. Bit Rate Interface (BRI) Circuits.  BRI (128 - 256 - 384 ....512kb) and/or any circuit provisioning to include 1.54T-1 must meet the end equipment requirements for our base multi-functions to connect and operate at layer 1 and layer 2.  Most circuits provisioned today come in 2-wire-line BRI (128kb each) - usually utilized for local video support.  BRI traffic (as with any locally received commercial circuits) is sent out to our serviced customer on dry cable pair to the end-device.  Past practices from local Telco, we receive new circuit on d-mark located at the main central office frame (MDF) - from there our techs will x-connect out to our cable plant and wire customer jack to Registered Jack (RJ)-45, RJ-48C as applicable.
  
3.3. Transport Services.  The Contractor shall provide local exchange transport channel services as specified in the order.  Local transport channel services include transport channel termination and transmission support, as applicable, for analog lines, Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) lines, High Capacity Digital Subscriber Line (HDSL), Digital Signal level 1 (DS-1), DS-3, OC-3, and may be expanded to Optical Carrier (OC)-12, OC-24, OC-48, and higher bandwidth where applicable.

3.4.

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (now operating as the U.S. AbilityOne Commission) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4), the Committee is required to complete an impact analysis related to the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		7920-00-NIB-0556<br />Name:		Sponge, All-Purpose, Nylon Mesh, 5" x 3 1/2" x 1 1/4"<br />Description:	Versatile, all-purpose scrubber constructed of nylon mesh over a synthetic sponge that offers scrubbing power without scratching 5" x 3 1/2" x 1 1/4". UOI is BX. BX = 24 sponges</p>
<p>NSN:		7920-00-NIB-0569<br />Name:		Sponge, All-Purpose, Nylon Mesh, 7 1/2" x 4 1/4" x 1 3/4"<br />Description:	Versatile, all-purpose scrubber constructed of nylon mesh over a synthetic sponge that offers scrubbing power without scratching 7 1/2" x 4 1/4" x 1 3/4" . UOI is BX. BX = 12 sponges.sponges.</p>
<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Committee to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Services Administration, Fort Worth, TX.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been determined to be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN:			7920-00-NIB-0556<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	720-SEV05B/   617559-720/ MCO 720-SEV15; 498-X6; 723-2F/ MMM7232F;</p>
<p>NSN:			7920-00-NIB-0559<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	BIR 368-36; BIR 354-24</p>
<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Total (A-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>These products will also be offered through the AbilityOne Distributor Program.  If your firm is currently selling these products to the Federal Government through commercial means, your firm will continue to sell these products through your AbilityOne Distributor status and there would be no impact against your firm.  If your firm is not an AbilityOne Distributor but would like to become a Distributor, please contact the AbilityOne Program for guidance.  At a minimum, your firm must have a GSA Schedule 75 contract with at least 10,000 items on the schedule contract to be eligible.  Firms can become AbilityOne Distributors for limited items such as toner cartridges or janitorial/sanitation items but must contact the AbilityOne Program for more details.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than November 12, 2013 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>

<a href="mailto:roman.e.laterza.civ@mail.mil">US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity</a>
<DESC>The United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA), Fort Detrick, MD intends to issue a sole source award utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc. for a Siemens Inveon Dedicated PET and Inveon Multimodality System. <br>  <br>      The U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) has a requirement for a Siemens Inveon Dedicated PET and Inveon Multimodality System for installment at the new USAMRIID infectious disease imaging facility for biosafety level 3 (RIIDIF3). The purchase of a single bed, yet dockable small animal PET/SPECT/CT scanner is critical to the successful development and implementation of the RIIDIF3. Thus, source selection is based on the following two fixed requirements: 1) Single bed to translate from CT to SPECT to PET and 2) PET can be separated (undocked) from the SPECT/CT to allow parallel imaging. The Siemens Inveon Multimodality PET/SPECT/CT scanner is the only imaging device that provides all three imaging modalities in a single scanner with a single bed. Also, the Inveon is the only device that provides a docking station that allows the PET scanner to be separated from the SPECT/CT scanner and will allow for parallel imaging procedures. The  quote mark exclusive quote mark  docking feature allows the PET and SPECT/CT to function independently as two separate scanners with their own acquisition computers or as a single integrated scanner when the PET is docked to the SPECT/CT scanner. When the PET scanner is docked to the SPECT/CT, the user can operate all three modalities from a single acquisition computer. This exclusive docking feature provides the user the versatility and flexibility to be able to perform PET and SPECT studies simultaneously in an undocked mode thereby increasing work flow and saving cost. This docking feature eliminates the need for an additional CT for the PET and saves money in service cost over having to purchase separate SPECT-CT and PET-CT gantries. <br>  <br>      This notice of intent is for information purposes only, therefore, no solicitation will result from this announcement. All sources eligible to provide this service must respond in writing. Responses must be supported with clear and convincing evidence to clearly be able to provide services outlined above. A request for documentation will not be considered as an affirmative response. If no responses are received, within 15 days, 12 November 2013, after publication of this notice, to the effect that comparable supplies and services are available, and that it is more advantageous to the Government than obtaining these services through a sole-source contract, then a sole source acquisition award will be made. Response to this award is to be sent to roman.e.laterza.civ@mail.mil  <br>

<DESC>R14PS94009 BPA Waterworks and Irrigation Material and Supply Services
Combined Synopsis/Solicitation: The Bureau of Reclamation has a requirement for the establishment of a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) for the period of December 1, 2013 through November 30, 2018 for Waterwork and Irrigation materials and supplies.  It is anticipated that multiple BPA awards will be the result of this announcement.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 423510 Metal Service Centers and Other Metal Merchant Wholesalers.  This small business size standard is 100 employees.  NAICS code 423720 Plumbing and Heating Equipment and Supplies (Hydronics) Merchant Wholesalers may also be applicable with a size standard of 100 employees.  This procurement is 100% set-aside for small business.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  The solicitation document and the incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through FAC 2005-26 (June-2008).  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The Solicitation Number for this Request is R14PS94009.
Background: Provo Area Office Force Account (PAOFA, FA) developed during the mid-1990's as an extension of support services for its materials and testing group.  In addition to supporting material and testing services, heavy equipment operators and civil engineering technicians provided valuable and immediate services during emergencies, and necessary repairs and maintenance of Reclamation facilities. This remains the primary role of FA; however, emergency and repair work is challenging to predict and plan for.  In order to maintain its capabilities, and ensure its existence at times of need, FA began doing repair and rehabilitation work agency-wide, and interagency-wide, within the Reclamation jurisdictional area. During the mid-2000's Reclamation performed its "Managing for Excellence" (M4E) studies.  Team 11 presented their report of cost comparisons for in-house versus outsourcing.  The concluding scope statement notes, "In today's engineering and construction climate, it is imperative that Reclamation make a concerted effort to collaborate with customers and stakeholders such that our operations are transparent and efficient.  At the same time, Reclamation must take positive steps to maintain our core technical capability in order to remain good stewards over our dams and other facilities."  Thus FA provides a constant presence for emergency demands and maintains some core technical construction capabilities where individual project or facility characteristics and demands may not, due to economic or time constraints, lend themselves to execution and administration through conventional contracting.
Given this role, FA is in consistent, and sometimes unpredictable, need of materials and supplies to accomplish assigned tasks in a timely and efficient manner.  Regularly, during active construction, crews will encounter unplanned modifications to scope, requiring immediate procurement of materials and supplies.  The intent of this BPA is to meet this need by providing pipe and waterwork material and supply needs in all regions FA performs services.
Possible Locations of Service: Force Account provides in-house construction services on Reclamation facilities, and on facilities of other federal agencies.  These services vary widely from embankment dam repair work to wetland mitigation construction efforts.  The location of construction also varies, and may be located anywhere in the 17 western states; however, the preponderance of construction projects fall within two general geographic areas.
North Region: The North Region is defined as the area north of the southern borders of Utah, Colorado, Kansas, and north of 37 degrees latitude in Nevada and California to the southern Canadian border, west to the pacific coast, and east to the eastern borders of Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, and North Dakota. The primary zone for construction projects is northern Utah and eastern Colorado; however, projects may be completed in any location within the region previously defined.  Following are examples of pertinent project locations that indicate geographic areas FA has completed work - the examples do not, however, represent locations work will be completed, although, on occasion, the construction crew is requested back to previous jobsites:		 Battlement Mesa Dam III, Parachute, Colorado	Crooked Creek Dam, Eagle, Colorado Crystal Lake Dam, Ouray, Colorado		Cedar View Dam, Neola, Utah Thunder Ranch Levee, Jensen, Utah		Provo River Rehabilitation, Heber, Utah Humbug Pond, Heber, Utah			Fontenelle, Wyoming Ochoco Dam, Oregon			MIAD, Sacramento, California Echo Dam, Utah				Newton Reservoir, Utah Myton, Utah				Trenton Dam, Nebraska Enders Dam, Nebraska			Stamped Dam, Truckee, California Prosser Dam, Truckee, California		Angostura Dam, South Dakota
South Region: The South Region is defined as the area south of the southern borders of Utah, Colorado, Kansas, and South of 37 degrees latitude in Nevada and California to the northern border of Mexico, west to the pacific coast, and east to the eastern borders of Oklahoma and Texas.
The primary zone for construction projects is along the Colorado River Corridor from Las Vegas, Nevada to Yuma, Arizona; however, projects may be completed in any location within the region previously defined.  Following are examples of pertinent project locations that indicate geographic areas PAO FA has completed work - the examples do not, however, represent locations work will be completed, although, on occasion, the construction crew is requested back to previous jobsites:		 Las Vegas, Nevada				Moapa, Nevada Parker Dam, California/Arizona		Blythe, California Imperial Dam, California/Arizona		Beal Lake, Arizona Needles, California				Chama, New Mexico Flagstaff, Arizona				McClellan Dam, Texas Davis Dam, Nevada/Arizona			Navajo Dam, New Mexico
This BPA will require vendor's ship requested supplies anywhere within the designated geographical area, north or south, to the jobsite associated with the requested supply.  Delivery urgency and acceptable lead times will be a function of market availability, and project requirements communicated at the time a request is made.

<DESC>Description of Work: In support of the Burned Area Emergency Stabilization and Rehabilitation Plan (BAER), the Stanislaus National Forest has a requirement for the aerial mulching application of approximately 3872 acres of high and moderate severity burn terrain cause by the Rim Fire. Straw mulch shall be applied at rate of approximately 1 ton/acre; with a coverage level of approximately 1" over 80% of the mulch unit, unless individual sub-units call for a variation to the application rate as identified on the table in 7-2 Specifications. The awarded contractor shall supply aircraft and all necessary straw mulch, labor, supplies and equipment necessary to complete the work. Straw mulch as defined by this contract is rice, wheat, barley or oat straw, with a government preference for rice straw. Cautionary Note: Cereal Leaf Beetle has been detected in Northern California and could result in quarantined straw material. Rice Straw is not affected by this quarantine notice.
<p>Straw that is determined to contain California listed noxious weeds or other unwanted plants/insects will be designated ineligible for use under the contract. The contractor will be responsible for ensuring weed free mulch and removing ineligible straw from the National Forest. The Forest Service may conduct random, unannounced inspections of straw deliveries in order to ensure that the straw utilized in this contract is free of California Department of Food and Agriculture listed noxious or undesirable weeds/insects. Before unloading, transit and certified weed free certificates shall be provided for each load of straw delivered, unless otherwise agreed upon by contract administrator.</p>
<p>The work under this contract will consist of aerial mulching the areas designated on the attached project maps. The contractor may stage straw mulch at various sites on Public Lands when requested by the Contractor and approved by the Forest Service prior to staging. The Forest Service will identify suitable staging areas in the vicinity of the mulch units; however the Contractor is not obligated to use these sites. It is the Contractor's responsibility to make all necessary arrangements for use of air bases, loading zones, equipment, fuel storage area, and all loading operations. The Contractor assumes all costs and liability for operation and rehabilitation of sites to the satisfaction of the COR, designated inspectors, or landowner if on non-NFS system lands.</p>
<p>Items listed in the Schedule may be awarded to multiple offerors when it is to the advantage of the Government to meet the contract period.<br /><br />Contractor Responsibility: The Contractor shall provide everything--including, but not limited to, all equipment, supplies, transportation, labor, and supervision--necessary to complete the project, except for that which the contract clearly states is to be furnished by the Government. Since the fire area is not controlled, all contractor personnel working in the fire area must wear fire resistant clothing and have readily available a supply of Government Furnished Fire Shelters. One fire shelter per employee working in the fire area.</p>
<p>The Contractor will provide a Work Plan that addresses how the work identified in the Scope of Work description will be accomplished. The Work Plan shall contain at a minimum a Safety Plan, Communications Plan, Spill Prevention Plan, Fire Prevention/Suppression Plan, and an Operations Plan explaining how the Contractor will complete the designated work and provide for quality assurance.</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for Quality Control and shall provide a copy of its Quality Control Plan (QCP) as part of the project proposal. The Plan must demonstrate how the Contractor shall assure that quality of performance meets the objectives and requirements of the contract. The QCP shall specify:</p>
<p>&bull; How quality will be monitored to ensure performance standards are met.<br />&bull; How the work will be supervised<br />&bull; Identify the personnel responsible for performing quality control<br />&bull; How results of the monitoring will result in quality performance <br />&bull; How daily progress and monitoring results will be communicated to the CO/COR<br />&bull; How the requirements for ensuring noxious or unwanted weeds/insects are not contained in the delivered straw mulch bales<br />&bull; How the contractor will meet safety and resource protection objectives<br />&bull; How the contractor will conduct final clean-up/restoration/rehabilitation of roads, staging areas, helispots, etc.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall assure that performance meets contract specifications, in accordance with FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, paragraph (a); prior to requesting the Government to inspect for payment or acceptance. The Contractor shall contact the Contracting Officer upon completion of a unit. The Contracting Officer may observe the Contractor's inspection at any time and shall otherwise have unlimited access to the inspection data.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.<br /></p>

OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high-level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.  USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits.  For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 13 of this solicitation.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Transition programming in Afghanistan is one of the United States government's top priorities.  OTI's current engagement in Afghanistan began in 2009. OTI aims to build strong, resilient communities in districts vital to Afghanistan's overall stability and development by strengthening communities' ability to withstand political and social upheaval, insurgent infiltration, and other shocks and pressures as international donor funds and military support draw down. With OTI support, Afghans will be able to rebuild, strengthen and connect their communities to the wider social and political structures. To achieve these objectives, OTI incorporates a number of programming principles that emphasize a process-oriented, Afghan-led approach to implementation.</p>
<p>OTI implements clusters of community-focused small grants through a process-oriented approach with Afghan ownership of decisions and results. In OTI's programming, the project processes are as important as project outputs in contributing to the program's strategic goal of stabilization. The program utilizes both "soft" (e.g., community cohesion jirgas, outreach visits by district government; cultural and recreational activities) and "hard" (e.g., small-scale infrastructure) activities to strengthen linkages between vulnerable communities and positive community resiliencies and customary leadership, increasing community cohesion in the process.</p>
<p>The Deputy Country Representative is a member of the DCHA/OTI Afghanistan/Pakistan Regional Team, reports to the OTI Country Representative, and is based in Kabul, Afghanistan with extended TDY's to regional military commands.</p>
<p>The Deputy Country Representative's principal responsibility is to support the OTI Country Representative in the development, oversight and management of the OTI country program.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this position is to ensure that OTI has a highly-qualified Deputy Country Representative in the field that will represent OTI and fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the position.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Deputy Country Representative requires teamwork, strong analytical and organizational skills, the exercise of good judgment and personal responsibility, and ability to communicate with a variety of interlocutors.  As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success.  The incumbent has a high level of integrity and attention to detail to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation.  The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce.  S/he places a premium on building positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID.  The incumbent is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting his/her supervisor in responding to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team.  The incumbent is highly responsible, service-oriented, organized, pays close attention to detail, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner.  The Deputy Country Representative is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>The work of the OTI Deputy Country Representative requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility.  Under the direct supervision of the OTI Country Representative, the Deputy Country Representative will:</p>
<p>&bull;	Represent OTI interests during meetings with USAID Mission personnel, U.S. Embassy staff, military personnel, host-country government officials, international organizations, indigenous and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international donors, and others interested in DCHA/OTI activities;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide continued guidance on the identification and development of projects that meet OTI funding criteria, further OTI programmatic objectives, and complement other projects and programs implemented by other OTI offices as well as with USG agencies, the military, and donor organizations;</p>
<p>&bull;	Evaluate proposals and grant concepts and work with diverse groups-many of which have not previously had international funding;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist the Country Representative in monitoring the performance of the OTI implementing partners in the implementation of OTI-financed activities designed to achieve OTI strategic objectives;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist in the monitoring and evaluation of OTI-sponsored activities;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist the Country Representative in managing and/or supervising OTI field staff posted in or outside of the main field office, the Foreign Service National Staff, including but not limited to program officers, and administrative assistants;</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform a wide range of administrative functions (budget preparation, financial management, records management, travel assistance, etc.) to help ensure programmatic success;</p>
<p>&bull;	Communicate regularly and share program information with other USAID project managers, bilateral donors, UN Organizations, International Organizations, the military, and indigenous and international NGOs to ensure visibility and synergy of USAID/OTI activities;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist in developing an exit strategy in coordination with the OTI Country Representative that ensures reasonable time to transition from OTI programs to follow-on USAID or other donor programs or host government control;</p>
<p>&bull;	Travel to monitor and assess political conditions, implementing partner operational platforms, meet with potential grantees, host government and other program counterparts, and develop activity ideas;</p>
<p>&bull;	Collaborate on collecting information and drafting/editing regular reporting products;</p>
<p>&bull;	When required, report regularly to the OTI Country Representative and OTI/Washington on the status of: 1) grant development and implementation; 2) OTI contractor performance; 3) FSN staff support needs and morale; 4) communication and coordination issues among OTI offices with other USG entities; 5) security concerns; 6) relations with local partners, including national and subnational government representatives; and 7) other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull;	When required, assume higher representational responsibilities, potentially serving as acting OTI Country Representative in his/her absence, for example;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist the Country Representative mentor/train other OTI and implementing partner field staff as required; and,</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform other duties as determined by the supervisor or OTI Regional Team Leader to help ensure successful OTI program implementation.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Deputy Country Representative will report to OTI's Country Representative in the designated country.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The Supervisor will set overall objectives.  The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished.  Work plans, timesheets, regional travel, and funding associated with support costs will be approved through OTI Washington.  The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision. Though this is a senior field-based position, the incumbent is expected to actively and proactively collaborate with OTI Washington leadership, and to fully utilize, embrace, and become an expert on OTI systems and processes.  Failure to adequately perform the scope of work above and/or failure to take direction from the Supervisor may result in corrective actions, including denial of step or grade increases, extension of contract probationary periods, performance improvement plans, and/or termination for the convenience of USAID/OTI.</p>
<p>10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is at times physically demanding.  During site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or the carrying of moderately heavy items.</p>
<p>11.  WORK ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>Depending on the assignment location in-country, the work may be performed in an office environment and/or on a military compound.

<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.    <br>    <br>  The U.S. Army is interested in locating manufacturers currently cutting and sewing Army Combat Uniforms or with previous experience in manufacturing the uniform according to specifications, that would be interested in participating in a permethrin treated fabric cut and sew trial.  Ideally the facility will have an isolated production line dedicated to ACU production.  The facility must be willing to allow access for the Government and contracted environmental sampling companies to collect environmental samples during regular ACU production with standard Nylon Cotton (NyCo) material (baseline) and then while using a permethrin impregnated material (trial).  Environmental sampling will take place over at least 2 days of production for both the untreated and treated materials.  Work area samples to be taken may include air collection in and around the facility and equipment as well as surface swabs.  Additionally, employees of the facility may be asked to wear small, lightweight air sampling pumps during the manufacturing process to measure the amount of permethrin present in the air in the immediate worker area.  The air sampling pumps clip onto the employee's belt and will not interfere with the employee's ability to complete their work.  Hand swabs of employees' skin (such as hands and arms) may also be included in determining the amount of permethrin released into the work environment during the manufacturing process. Results of any personal sampling can be made available and provided to the respective employee for entry into their medical records.  Facilities must be willing to cease production of the untreated ACUs in the trial area during the permethrin fabric trial.  All treated uniforms manufactured during the study will be transferred to the Army PM for fielding.   <br>    <br>  Information provided should include the manufacturer's ability to provide an operational and isolated production line, capabilities to produce first quality ACUs, facility diagrams (to include layout, square footage,  location and number of air circulation fans, types of filters etc.), number of cutting and sewing operations and personnel per operation, description of all identified activities/processes that employees will be involved in for each work area during manufacturing, shift length and number of shifts being run, facility air exchange rate, location and operational status of any local exhaust ventilation (such as an exhaust fan with flexible hose/elephant trunk attachment), the number of days required to cut and sew 3,000 full uniforms, the number of shifts per day and the length of the shifts.  <br>       <br>  Manufacturers should also provide a cost estimate to cut and sew 3,000 ACU coats and/or trousers. Treated fabric (and untreated fabric if ACUs are not currently being produced) will be provided by the Government.  Cost estimates should consider all aspects of the assembly process excluding the fabric.  There is an opportunity for plus-up should one be required to reach 80-100% production capacity.  Anticipated timeframe for cut and sew trial is Winter2013/Spring 2014.   <br>    <br>  Information submitted shall include: 1. Company name and address. 2. Point of contact, telephone, fax, Web address, and e-mail address. 3. Relevant company background/experience (including information detailed in the FedBizOps Note 25 regarding a firm's experience, personnel, and facilities)   <br>    <br>  This Market Survey is for information purposes only and does NOT bind the U.S. Government to any type of contracting action, or guarantee any purchase by the U.S. Government.   <br>    <br>  Submittals: Information about a particular brand/product should be submitted in electronic (MS Word) format by 4:00 pm EST on 25 Nov 2013 by e-mail to Ms. Melynda Perry at melynda.perry.civ@mail.mil.

Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract.

Private-sector offerors on acquisitions subject to OMB Circular No. A-76 are also not considered interested parties for purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest. <BR> <BR>?	Protest decision authority: The AMC command counsel is designated as the HQAMC protest decision authority. In the absence of command counsel the deputy command counsel is designated. ?	Time for filing a protest: A HQAMC protest shall be filed in accordance with the timeframes set out in FAR 33.103(e). HQAMC office hours are 8 AM to 4:30 PM Eastern Standard Time. Time for filing any document expires at 4:30 PM (EST) on the given day. ?	Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the HQAMC-level protest, the HQAMC-level protest will be dismissed.

Processing of HQAMC-level protests: Within 10 working days after the protest is filed, the contracting officer, with the assistance of legal counsel, shall file with the HQAMC Office of Command Counsel (ATTN: AMCCC-PL) one copy of an administrative report in response to the protest. Reports shall be sent by fax, over-night mail or hand-delivered to ensure timely receipt. 
The HQAMC protest decision authority will issue a written decision within 20 working days of the protest filing. The written decision will be binding on AMC and its contracting activities.

When such an extension is granted, the protester and all interested parties shall be notified within one working day of the decision to grant the extension. ?	Remedies: The HQAMC protest decision authority may grant any one or combination of the following remedies: o	Terminate the contract o	Recompete the requirement o	Issue a new solicitation o	Refrain from exercising options under the contract o	Award a contract consistent with statute and regulation o	Pay appropriate costs as stated in FAR 33.102(b)(2) o	Other remedies as the HQAMC protest decision authority determines necessary to correct a defect. <BR> <BR>?	Protests before award: When a protest is filed with HQAMC prior to award, a contract may not be awarded unless authorized by the HQAMC director of contracting, in accordance with FAR 33.103(f). ?	Protests after award: When a protest is filed with HQ AMC within 10 calendar days after award, or within five calendar days of debriefing for any debriefing that was requested as required by FAR 15.506, the contracting officer shall suspend performance. 
The HQAMC director of contracting may authorize contract performance, notwithstanding the protest, upon a written finding that contract performance will be in the best interests of the United States; or urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect the interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a decision from the HQAMC protest decision authority. 
52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: <br />(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and <br />(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.<br />(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.<br />(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <br />(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br />(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. <br />(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <br />(End of clause)</span></p>

The Government has space at the delivery point to receive and store up to 15 cylinders of hydrogen at a time. It is the objective of this requirement to keep on hand between 450 and 1,500 CF of hydrogen, with a minimum of 1,050 CF being used each week, leaving approximately a three-day supply of hydrogen as backup stock in case of additional unplanned balloon launches, or other unforeseen circumstances.

All deliveries must be executed between the hours of 0800 and 1445 local time. This is a strict time slot as the balloon launches must not be delayed or interrupted in order to receive the delivery. Balloon launches occur twice a day, every day of the year, regardless of holidays. Therefore, the delivery schedule needs to be maintained regardless of holidays. If a holiday falls on a scheduled delivery day and the Contractor is not able to complete a regularly scheduled delivery, the Contractor shall make arrangements in advance for an alternative delivery date. The Contractor will contact the National Weather Service office if a delivery is going to be delayed for any other reason.<br /><br />Transition Period: If this contract is awarded to other than the incumbent Contractor, then prior to the first day of the contract, the new Contractor and one of the agency points of contact, listed in section 8 below, shall establish the delivery schedule, including coordinating the initial delivery to coincide with the pickup of cylinders by the former contractor. Likewise, upon completion of this contract, if the new follow-on contract is awarded to other than the current Contractor, the current Contractor shall participate in the transition coordination efforts in order to minimize the risk of a missed balloon launch due to the hydrogen being unavailable at the launch site. The end-of-contract transition period may include a lighter delivery in the final weeks of the contract.</span></p>

<DESC><p>On October 24, 2013 the Government erroneously referenced an award notice to RFQ 10693K1065. This notice is to cancel that award notice tied to 10693K1065, as there was no award for this RFQ solicited through Fedbid.com. The solicitation and referenced Fedbid.com auction referenced in this notice was cancelled due to a change in the requirement that was not communicated appropriately to industry with an appropriate "Name Brand Justification" in accordance with FAR 6-302-1(c) Brand Name Only requirements. A separate solicitation and posting for that RFQ was made on FBO.gov outside of Fedbid.com under solicitation 10693K1065_1 and the award notice was reposted to that RFQ 10693K1065_1 as award SAQMMA13M2529 on FBO.gov. Further clarification can be requested directly with the Contracting Officer Vincent J. Sanchez at 703-875-6629.</p>

Point of contact: Deborah Teubert (405) 734-8118 DLA-Aviation/AOAC 3001 Staff Dr. Suite 2AG1109B Tinker AFB OK 73145 21. Mandatory Language: Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Supplies or services required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Therefore, the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In accordance with FAR 52.225-3, Buy American Act - Free Trade Agreements, one or more of these items under this acquisition is subject to the Free Trade Agreement. Based upon market research the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Governments requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer. Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hard copies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov. It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed. This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set-aside). Foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could if otherwise eligible participate as subcontractor(s). Due to the complexity and criticality of this part, only actual manufactures or approved suppliers that have successfully completed all testing required by the original company responsible (OEM) and have successfully completed all testing on items determined by the government to be similar in complexity and criticality can be considered approved sources for this item. An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from Offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. 22. UID: If unit price exceeds $5,000.00 then UID requirements will apply.

There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com.Sellers that are not currently registered to use www.FedBid.com should proceed to www.FedBid.com to complete their free registration.

Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means. It is unacceptable to place bad faith bids, to use decoys in the www.FedBid.com process or to collude with the intent or effect of hampering the competitive www.FedBid.com process.Should Sellers require additional clarification, contact FedBid at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or clientservices@fedbid.com. <BR> <BR>Use of FedBid:   Buyers and Sellers agree to conduct this transaction through FedBid in compliance with the FedBid Terms of Use.

While additional support documentation (e.g. Seller Attachments) may be requested, pricing shall be entered as a 'bid' in the reverse auction - offline pricing is not an acceptable bid.

<DESC><p><strong>1. Purpose: </strong>
<p>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Aegis Ashore (AA) Program is conducting market research to determine interest, cost, and capability to manufacture skids to be fabricated at a contractor location and shipped to a location within the continental United States to be determined at a later date. This market research will provide information to: 1) identify potential sources and their experience base to fulfill the requirements; 2) support the development of acquisition requirements, strategies, and cost estimates; 3) identify barriers to competition to reduce competition risk; 4) determine the need for documentation necessary to support proposal preparation; and 5) provide information on the capabilities of small business to fulfill the requirements in order to assess the feasibility of a total Small Business set-aside. The contemplated contract type is Firm Fixed Price (FFP). The resultant knowledge aids MDA in determining the best acquisition strategy to fulfill this requirement.</p>
<p>This is a market research announcement for informational planning purposes only and does not constitute a formal Request for Proposal (RFP), nor shall it be construed as a commitment by MDA. Information submitted will be considered an exchange of capabilities. Any proprietary information provided should be properly marked and MDA will control it as such. MDA is not accepting any classified information. No solicitation will be issued at this time. Participation in this effort is strictly voluntary with no cost or obligation to be incurred by MDA. MDA is not bound by this information if a solicitation is issued. No funds are available to pay for preparation of responses to this announcement. Any information submitted by responders to this Request for Information (RFI) is strictly voluntary. The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this notice. The information provided herein is subject to change and does not bind the Government to solicit for or award a contract.</p>
<strong>
<p>2. Background:</p>
</strong>
<p>The AA Program was established on September 17, 2009 in response to the direction of the President of the United States. As part of the President's Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) for Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD), AA builds upon already deployed U.S. Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) assets and adapts a sea-based weapon system for use on land. This will be accomplished by adapting the Aegis Weapon System (AWS) and Vertical Launching System (VLS) to the land based concept. The AA Missile Defense System (AAMDS) provides the capability to detect, track, intercept, and destroy missiles.</p>
</p>
<p>The AA Program Office is developing an acquisition strategy to deploy the AAMDS at a designated Poland site in calendar year 2018. The skid fabrication efforts required under this acquisition have been considered in relation to the requirements and milestones of the AA Program to establish realistic deadlines and deliverables, while balancing the AA funding profiles. The AA program's evaluation of the skid acquisition strategy alternatives will be accomplished in multiple stages. This RFI/ Sources Sought provides an invitation for interested parties to provide input and information on their capabilities.<strong>
<p>3. Description:</p>
</strong>
<p>The purpose of this RFI / Sources Sought is to aid MDA in determining if there is sufficient industrial expertise and interest to manufacture build to print skids, as listed in the attached table, to support the AA platform in Poland. The fabricated items are to be completed at a contractor location within the continental United States and shipped to a location to be determined at a later date.</p>
<p>The AA skid design provides means for rapid deployment and installation of the Aegis Combat System. AA skids provide a foundation for installation of Aegis Combat System equipment and support for the combat system's functional interfaces including power, water, and air distribution.</p>
<p>The Government will not supply any special tooling or equipment for this requirement. Access to the drawing package will be provided to eligible contractors upon request and submission of required documentation as discussed in section 4 of this RFI.</p>
<p>The total requirement will be for the items and quantities referenced in the attached table.</p>
<p>AS9100 and/or ISO9001Certification/Compliance is a required qualification for bid submission.</p>
<p>Capability, certification to weld aluminum per AWS D17.1, experience with structures of similar or greater than size and complexity, machining to the dimensional requirements, and achieving the tolerances as indicated in the skid drawings are required qualifications for bid submission.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 334511, Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing, with a small business size standard of 750 employees, is the intended NAICS to be used for this action.</p>
<strong>
<p>4. Draft Specifications/Technical Data:</p>

This agreement shall be documented in a certified DD Form 2345. Upon review of your written request, verification of your status and acknowledgement of the contractor's responsibility under the U.S. Export laws and regulations, access to the requested documents will be provided. For respondents who do not currently have an approved DD Form 2345 on file with DLIS JCP, be advised that the processing time may take up to one month or more.

<DESC>This is a contract award for NIBIN Services, Equipment, and Software.&nbsp; The NIBIN Program was developed to work in concert with all of ATF's firearms enforcement initiatives. Through the NIBIN Program, ATF has successfully integrated its expertise in the regulation of the firearms industry and the effective enforcement of Federal firearms laws with technological advances in the forensic ballistics examination field. This unique program uses extensive ATF resources to work with our law enforcement counterparts to reduce firearms violence.&nbsp; The NIBIN Program uses the Integrated Ballistic Identification System (IBIS) to compare images of ballistic evidence (projectiles and cartridge casings) obtained from crime scenes and recovered firearms.
