<DESC>This Draft RFP is issued by HQ AFSOC/A7KQ to solicit responses, questions, suggestions from qualified offerors prior to the official solicitation.  Prospective offerors are invited to submit written comments, suggestions or questions via email to Diana R. Graziano at diana.graziano@hurlburt.af.mil no later than 2:00 p.m. CST on or before 2 December 2011.  When responding reference Draft RFP FA0021-12-R-0001 CV-22 CMS.  All answers to questions submitted will be posted to FedBizOpps.  Suggestions and comments may or may not be posted, however will be considered before posting the official RFP.

This Draft Solicitation provides for a non-personal services contract to augment the Government by providing CV-22 aircraft maintenance support.  It is anticipated to be a Competitive 8(a) acquisition approved by SBA with Requirement Number 0491/12/200137.  This acquisition is planned to consist of a base period of 12-months and 4 option periods.  Additionally, it is anticipated there will be a few Optional CLINs that may or may not be executed pending Government need, approvals and/or funding.  These options are detailed in the solicitation.  This requirement is for CV-22 Contractor Maintenance Support Augmentation.  It is planned to be a Fixed Price contract with reimbursable CLINs.  Due to the nature of this service, augmenting military units, the contractor does not have ownership of any of the maintenance functions.  Therefore, this requirement is not considered performance based.  The Government is providing details, number of CMEs, and locations for these services (see Attachment 1, Level of Support / Growth); however, the offeror is still required to meet all Statement of Work (SOW) requirements to include deliverables and Service Delivery Summary thresholds.  The periods of performance are as follows:  

Base Period:  1 April 2011  31 March 2012
Option Period 1:  1 April 2012  31 March 2013
Option Period 2:  1 April 2013  31 March 2014
Option Period 3:  1 April 2014  31 March 2015
Option Period 4:  1 April 2015  31 March 2016 


This requirement provides for non-personal Contractor Maintenance Support (CMS) services to Hurlburt Field, Florida; Kirtland AFB, New Mexico; Cannon AFB, New Mexico; and RAF Mildenhall, United Kingdom with an estimated start of 1 April 2013.  The plan for the Optional Mildenhall start up is to man 66% in option period one and 100% for the remaining periods (see Attachment 1, Level of Support/Growth).  There is potential for a future base in the PACOM with a start date to be determined later.  The CV-22 aircraft have the primary missions of combat and training missions driving both CONUS and O-CONUS support requirements.  The CV-22 is a weapons system that currently has limited organic maintenance capability.  Because of that limited capability and the complexity of the aircraft, the maintenance concept is a combined effort of Air Force and Contractor Maintenance Support (CMS) technicians.  Both Air Force and CMS technicians are responsible for Organizational level (O-level) and Intermediate level (I-level) maintenance.  The CV-22 aircraft located at Hurlburt Field, FL; Cannon AFB, NM; and RAF Mildenhall, UK, and potential for a future base in the PACOM AOR are operational assets that will be deployed overseas to conduct and support AFSOC operations.  CMS personnel assigned at those locations will be required to deploy or perform temporary duty world-wide in support of CV-22 mission requirements.  Contractor personnel at Kirtland AFB, NM will be required to support CONUS TDY operations.

The CMS service provider shall provide V-22 experienced maintenance production supervision and personnel to execute all Organizational and applicable Intermediate (O and I)-level maintenance operations.  The requirement is a mix of Mechanical Specialty Maintainers and Electrical/Avionics Specialty Maintainers as outlined in the solicitation Attachment 1.   The CV-22 program will continue to mature from a current 20 aircraft to an end-state of 50 aircraft through 2016.  Final aircraft basing is not yet determined.  The increase in aircraft may drive a requirement for additional growth in CMS personnel to conduct aircraft maintenance and on-the-job training at each location.  The specific personnel requirements are outlined in the attached Draft Solicitation Statement of Work found in Section C; Descriptions and Specifications.

<DESC>&nbsp;
<p>The Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA) is soliciting for a subscription to an Information Retrieval System containing Sales/Movement Data for scanned products sold by DeCA Commissaries and commercial supermarkets.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This includes a need for on-site contractor provided services.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Customer and/or demographic data may also be added to this requirement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>DeCA is a Department of Defense (DoD) Agency responsible for the operation of approximately 250 military commissaries throughout the world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A commissary is the equivalent of a commercial grocery store.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Information Retrieval System database must include sales/movement data for all scanned products sold by DeCA commissaries both within and outside the Continental United States (CONUS - defined as the 48 contiguous States); comparable, statistically significant sales data from a majority of supermarket chains throughout the United States; and sales movement data from supermarkets within the same geographical (metro) areas as commissaries.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In this context, supermarkets are defined as traditional grocery stores with annual volume over $2 million and Supercenter/mass merchant formats operated by Mass Merchandisers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Access to any available causal data and data the contractor provides to other retailers is also required.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Available data should include the current month and the previous 24 months.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO NOTE that DeCA front-end scanner data is not readily available to the general public.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As mandated by statute (10 U.S.C. 2487b), DeCA makes this data available to interested firms for an annual subscription fee (currently per year).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Execution of the requisite subscription agreement application and advance payment of $944,484 per year of data requested will entitle the subscriber to all available DeCA front-end scanner data for the years purchased.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The purchase of DeCA front-end scanner data IS NOT A GUARANTEE OF AN AWARD.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondents to this notice MUST be able to purchase not only DeCA front-end data but also the comparable commercial grocery store data for the same 24-month period.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Commercial grocery store chains offer their front-end data to interested firms on a fee basis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>DeCA is not interested in a contractor database that does not include front-end scanner data from both DeCA and comparable commercial sources, to include historical data.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Prior to DeCA awarding a contract for an Information Retrieval System, the successful offeror must execute an annual subscription agreement with DeCA, to include procuring the previous 24 months of DeCA front-end scanner data (if applicable).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Preferred Data retrieval method will be accomplished by access to the contractor's database system through the World Wide Web.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The proposed hardware/software solution must include a user-friendly, menu-based drag and click type application that will allow for significant data manipulation and report building capabilities, to include ad-hoc reporting, by DeCA personnel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Access to the web-based application must be compatible with the current DeCA network, shall not conflict with existing programs or capabilities, and shall not impede current operations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If the web-based application does not allow for the ability to produce ad-hoc reports, contractor shall submit alternative method for access to database that includes the same characteristics as outlined above.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As a minimum, either method of access must enable the operator to generate reports, to include ad-hoc reports, based on any number of parameters, to include, but not limited to: (1) Geographic Areas (DeCA areas, zones within DeCA areas, stores, and commercially defined markets); (2) Products (departments, categories, sub-categories and/or segments, brands, manufacturers, and a full range of product attributes such as UPC, selling unit size, selling unit type (can, bottle, etc.), selling unit flavor, and other well-defined product characteristics; (3) Measures and Derivative Calculations (dollar sales, unit sales, volume sales, Average Cumulative Volume (ACV) percent, average pricing (promotional, non-promotional), lift percentages, sales per point of distribution, etc); and (4) Time Periods (weekly, monthly, quarterly, etc.).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this Government requirement is 541910 and the Business Size Standard is $7.0 Million.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A solicitation will be issued as unrestricted for this requirement on or about April 12, 2012 with an anticipated closing date of May 14, 2012.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) under this NAICS Code in order to be eligible for a contract award.

PURPOSE OF the contractSCOPE OF WORK: As part of its capacity building efforts in Iraq, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is working with the Government of Iraq (GOI) to renovate the Iraqi Ministry of Agricultures (IMOA) Al Sewaira Agricultural Research Station, located in Wasit province.   This USDA project is being managed by USDAs Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) and is part of an overall United States Government effort to build capacity in various areas within the Government of Iraq.  USDA is working to build the capacity of the GOI in agricultural research and extension, as well as other agriculture-related subject areas. In a general Letter of Agreement between the USDA and the Iraq Ministry of Agriculture signed March 3, 2011, USDA and the IMOA agreed to collaborate on the renovation of the Al Sewaira Agricultural Research Station.  The Al Sewaira Research Station is located in Wasit province approximately 60 km (35 miles) southeast of Baghdad and covers approximately 150 hectares (375 acres or 625 donums) of fertile land.  It is located approximately 2,150 meters from the Al-Dohan canal, which is its primary source of water for irrigation.  Irrigation water is currently supplied from the canal via an open trench from the Al-Dohan Canal.  The Al Sewaira Research Station was established to conduct research on water management techniques and other aspects of agricultural production.  Its experimental fields are also used for extension purposes.  The major problems facing the Station are inadequate water supply, outdated and inefficient irrigation systems, and blockage of drainage pipes.  The renovation of the Station will improve the supply of irrigation water to the Station and improve the irrigation and drainage system used on the Station in order to improve the agricultural research and extension capacity of the Station.  FAS Office of Agricultural Affairs is located in the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, Iraq and is part of the FAS global network of agricultural economists, marketing experts, negotiators, and other specialists stationed in more than 90 countries to support U.S. agricultural interests.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Background:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></strong></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is an agency within the U.S. Department of Transportation whose primary mission is to reduce deaths, injuries and economic losses resulting from motor vehicle crashes. This is accomplished by:</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&bull;Setting and enforcing national safety performance standards for motor vehicles and equipment;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&bull;Providing grants to state and local governments to enable them to conduct effective local highway safety programs;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&bull;Marketing and promoting safety messages, campaigns and materials to various audiences aimed at raising awareness and influencing and sustaining positive traffic safety behaviors.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">Research has demonstrated that increasing safety belts and preventing impaired driving is the most effective means to meet NHTSA's core mission.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">NHTSA estimates that increasing safety belts use can reduce crash fatalities by up to 45 percent in cars and 60 percent in light trucks. Every one percent increase in safety belt use translates into 2.8 million more Americans buckled up, 250 additional lives saved and 4,000 fewer serious injuries annually.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">Impaired driving-related deaths account for 42 percent of all traffic fatalities annually. Driving impaired is one of the most often committed crimes in America, affecting 1 in 3 citizens annually, resulting in 1 fatality every 30 minutes, 45 deaths every day and more than 13,000 fatalities annually.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">Based on ten (10) plus years of research, NHTSA and its partners have determined that conducting traffic enforcement with highly visible publicity and advertising is the most effective way to influence audiences to buckle up and deter impaired driving.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">NHTSA's national communications plan supports the agency's policy and program priorities. High Visibility Enforcement for safety belt use and impaired driving prevention is the cornerstone of the national plan. NHTSA recommends that States and local communities also implement HVE as the foundation of their communications efforts and build around their key enforcement periods. Based on numerous years of experience working at the national and state levels, NHTSA has developed recommendations for communications strategy and tactical plans for state and local partners to effectively promote traffic safety year round.</span></p>

<DESC><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The Naval Research Laboratory's (NRL's) Laboratory for Autonomous Systems Research (LASR) provides specialized facilities to support highly innovative, multidisciplinary research in autonomous systems, including intelligent autonomy, sensor systems, power and energy systems, human-system interaction, networking and communications, and platforms. The laboratory capitalizes on the broad multidisciplinary character of NRL, bringing together scientists and engineers with disparate training and backgrounds to attack common goals in autonomous systems at the intersection of their respective fields. The laboratory provides unique facilities and simulated environments (littoral, desert, tropical) and instrumented reconfigurable high bay spaces to support integration of science and technology components into research prototype systems. The objective of the laboratory is to enable Navy and DoD scientific leadership in this complex, emerging area and to identify opportunities for advances in future defense technology.</span>&nbsp;<br /><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt"><br />The NRL LASR has a need for a multi-element wave generation system. The multi-element wave generation system will be used in the simulated littoral environment in an existing pool to create directional water surface wave fields. The pool could contain seawater or freshwater. The system must be capable of removal from and reinstallation into the pool using an overhead crane (maximum weight 4,536 kilograms or 10,000 pounds). Complete specifications will be published with the request for proposal (RFP).<br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt"><br />Delivery of the system is required six months after date of award of contract.<br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt"><br />The NRL uses electronic commerce RFPs and amendments to RFPs. Paper copies of the RFP will not be provided. The actual closing date for proposals will be stated in the solicitation when issued.<br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA"><br />All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, Office of Acquisition and Grants, Sacramento Branch intends to negotiate and award a noncompetitive simplified acquisition (purchase order) with the Research Corporation of the University of Hawaii, as fiscal agent for University of Hawaii at Hilo and the Center for the Study of Active Volcanoes (CSAV) to conduct an international training course designed to disseminate knowledge and techniques for forecasting volcanic eruptions to scientists from developing nations.  The emphasis of the training course is on the development of practical skills, integrating both field and classroom experiences.  The field training emphasizes volcano monitoring methods currently in use by the USGS.  Participants are taught the use and maintenance of volcano monitoring instruments.  The training program addresses the assessment of volcanic hazards and the interrelationship of scientists, government officials, and the news media during volcano crises.  Completion of the program results in a certification in volcano monitoring.
CSAV is a joint venture between the University of Hawaii at Hilo, the University of Hawaii at Manoa, and the U.S. Geological Surveys Hawaiian Volcano Observatory.  CSAV is the only institution in the United States which offers formal training in the monitoring of active volcanic processes and managing volcanic crises.  Therefore, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.106-1(b)(1), there is only one source reasonably available which can meet the immediate requirement described above.
The proposed action will be a firm-fixed price purchase order awarded noncompetitively in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) as stated above, utilizing the Simplified Acquisition Procedures of FAR Part 13.  Any other interested and capable sources may submit a capabilities statement to the Contracting Officer via email at jcaravelli@usgs.gov for the purposes of determining whether competitive opportunities exist.  Capabilities statements must specifically address the requirements described above and demonstrate existing expertise in providing comprehensive training in volcano monitoring techniques.  Capabilities statements must be transmitted not later than close of business local time Friday, 13 April 2012 to be considered for this immediate acquisition.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 5 Network Contracting Office anticipates issuing a solicitation for a contractor-operated Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) in accordance with FAR part 12 & 15 and 38 USC 8153.  A single award IDIQ contract with a base year and 4 option years is contemplated.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 621498 with a size standard of $10.0 million (USD).  It is anticipated that the solicitation will be issued on or about May 1, 2012.  Proposals will be due 30 days after issuance of the solicitation. This notice is for informational purposes only and is not a request for proposals. The Government is not obligated to issue a solicitation as a result of this notice.

The clinic must be located within a 5 mile radius of the current clinic location (847 Cantrell Ave, Suite 100; Harrisonburg, VA).  It is anticipated that in its first year of operation, the Harrisonburg CBOC will have approximately 3,545 veteran enrollees.  Payments under the contemplated contract would be made on a capitated-rate basis.  The company awarded the contract will be required to have a fully operation clinic up and running on or before the 90th day after award.  

Contractor set-up activities include, but are not limited to: 
1) leasing adequate space
2) furnishing the space with adequate office furniture
3) equipping the space with adequate office, computer and medical equipment
4) providing physicians and other health care providers with the requisite licenses, credentials, certifications, etc.
5) working with the VA to connect to the VA computer network
6) ensuring that the clinic will be compliant with all relevant VA and JCAHO regulations from the first day of operation

Operational activities include, but are not limited to, handling all operational activities of a primary care and mental health clinic, and using the VA Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) to enter all information related to patient care.  The contractor would provide primary care and mental health services in a clinic environment, solely to veterans who primarily reside in Rockingham, Albemarle, Augusta and Greene counties of Virginia, and Harrisonburg City, VA.   

The contractor operated CBOC must have the necessary facilities, professional medical staff, diagnostic testing and treatment capability, and referral arrangements needed to ensure continuity of health care.  Primary Care services include longitudinal outpatient medical care for the purposes of prevention and detection of disease and subsequent management of medical conditions, for veterans deemed eligible.  The contractor will also be responsible for documenting care provided using CPRS.  The care will be provided by primary care providers who must be either family practitioners or general internists or their authorized designees.  Furthermore, the physician providers must be Board Certified/Board Eligible and licensed to practice in the state of Virginia.  The proposed CBOC, at a minimum, shall provide one standard of care that must be consistent, safe and of high quality.  Additionally, the proposed CBOC is expected to comply with all relevant VA policies and procedures, including those related to quality, patient safety and performance.  The care provided by the CBOC should be patient centered, continuous, accessible, coordinated, and consistent with VA Medical Center standards, including the thirteen service standards detailed in VHA Directive 2006-041, "Veterans Health Care Service Standards," dated 6/27/06 (http://www.va.gov/vhapublications/ViewPublication.asp?pub_ID=1443).  Finally, the VA Office of Patient Care Services, Primary Care Program Office, is undertaking a new initiative to implement a patient-centered medical home (PCMH) model at all Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Primary Care sites which is referred to as Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACT).  This initiative supports the VHA Universal Health Care Services Plan to redesign VHA healthcare delivery through increasing access, coordination, communication, and continuity of care.  PACT provides accessible, coordinated, comprehensive, patient-centered care, and is managed by primary care providers with the active involvement of other clinical and non-clinical staff.  PACT allows patients to have a more active role in their health care and is associated with increased quality improvement, patient satisfaction, and a decrease in hospital costs due to fewer hospital visits and readmissions.  Additional information on PACT can be found here: http://www.va.gov/primarycare/pcmh/).

<DESC><strong>Low Phase Noise Generator <br /><br />Contracting Office Address <br /></strong>Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, AFMETCAL, 813 Irving Wick Dr. W., Building 2, Heath, OH 43056-1199 <br /><strong><br />Description <br /></strong>This is a request for information (RFI) / SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS. This request is not a solicitation (Request for Proposal or Request for Quotations) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. The purpose of this request for information is in support of market research being conducted by the Air Force Metrology Calibration Program (AFMETCAL) to identify potential sources and gather information on current capabilities within the market. This synopsis is for planning purposes only and is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited hereunder. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense. The level of security clearance and amount of foreign participation in this requirement has not been determined. All information received in response to this RFI that is marked PROPRIETARY will be handled accordingly. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations. Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified. If, after reviewing these documents, you desire to participate in the market research, you should provide documentation that supports your company's capability in meeting these requirements. Failure to provide documentation may result in the government being unable to adequately assess your capabilities. If you lack sufficient experience in a particular area, please provide details explaining how you would overcome the lack of experience/capabilities in order to perform that portion of the requirement (i.e., teaming, subcontracting, etc.) Both large and small businesses are encouraged to participate in this Market Research. Joint ventures or teaming arrangements are encouraged.<br />The Air Force Metrology and Calibration Program is considering a purchase of a Low Phase Noise Generator. This synthesized signal generator will be used by the Air Force Primary Standards Laboratory (AFPSL) and the Air Force's Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratories (PMELs) and is replacing the HP/Agilent 8664A option H15 signal generator used in the E5504B Phase Noise Measurement Systems. While having AM/FM/PM modulation capability, output power of at least 13 dBm, it will also have exceptional spectral purity, especially where it comes to phase noise. As an example of the phase Noise specifications see chart below. The signal generator must also be able to emulate an 8664A option H15 in the E5504B Phase Noise System Console and be able to be used outside of the Phase Noise System console with the same specifications.

The Army Contracting Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Tobyhanna Division-Contract Operations Branch, Tobyhanna Army Depot (TYAD), Tobyhanna, PA 18466 intends to negotiate and award a contract on a sole source basis to Rockwell-Collins, Inc., 400 Collins Road Northeast, Cedar Rapids, IA  52498, for the conversion of a total quantity of 750 GPSIS Receiver Circuit Card Assemblies (CCAs) from NSN 5825-01-529-2565 to NSN 5998-01-536-9465 to be usable within the Long Range Scout Surveillance System (LRAS3).  The CCAs contain proprietary software that enables them to communicate with specific systems.  The aforementioned quantity of CCAs does not currently operate with the LRAS3 system.  The Contractor shall remove unusable software and reprogram each NSN 5825-01-529-2565 CCA with the Attitude Determination Software (ADS), Part Number 091-3304-102, converting the CCAs to NSN 5998-01-536-9465.  TYAD expects to support the LRAS3 until 2030, however both GPSIS Receiver CCAs are becoming obsolete and no other version has been approved for use.  The Government does not have sufficient technical data for the end-item to propose a redesign to the CCA nor does the Government own a technical data package (to include software code) suitable for a competitive acquisition.  Rockwell-Collins, Inc. (Rockwell) is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of both versions of GPSIS Receiver CCAs and is also the copyright holder/licenser of the ADS.  Raytheon, the OEM for the LRAS3, the TYAD end item of repair, confirmed that the Rockwell-Collins GPSIS Receivers are the only CCAs that will work within the LRAS3 and only if programmed with the appropriate software.  Raytheon also confirmed that Rockwell-Collins is the sole provider and licenser for this software The required delivery is 150 CCAs per month with the entire effort completed within six (6) months.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Any firms believing they can provide the requirements for the conversion of the LRAS3 GPSIS Receiver CCAs from NSN 5825-01-529-2565 to NSN 5998-01-536-9465 should within ten (10) days of this notice, contact the Contract Specialist identified below, and submit a capability statement which will be reviewed for consideration.

<DESC>This announcement is for informational purposes only. The Bath VA Medical Center, Bath, NY intends to award a contract for Architect/Engineer (A/E) Design Services, NAICS 541310, to provide a design for upgrading the building 92 auditorium. The Medical Center will use the short selection process defined in FAR 36.602-5 (a). As such, the VA intends to evaluate the technical qualifications of all Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Business and Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB & SDVOSB) A/E firms that are currently on file.  The VA will identify the three most highly qualified SDVOSB and VOSB A/E firms who have responded to competitive solicitations over the past 12 months. The geographic range being considered for this selection is 200 miles from 76 Veterans Avenue, Bath, NY, and only firms on file within that range will be considered. Existing information on file indicates that the socio-economic set-aside within this geographic radius is Veteran Owned Small Business. If evidence of three service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSB) can be identified, a set-aside to this socio-economic category will be considered. Firms wishing to be considered who are within the 200 mile radius but have not submitted a technical qualifications package within the past 12 calendar months may submit a SF 330's, listing qualifications, to the attention of Cheryl Brimmer, Contract Specialist, VA Medical Center, 76 Veterans Avenue, Bath, NY 14810. Firms who have previously submitted qualifications need not resubmit. SF 330's must be received at the Bath VA Medical Center by 4:30 pm, April 11, 2012.  VOSB and SDVOSB A/E firms must be verified in VetBiz (www.vetbiz.gov) to receive consideration. The preferred method of submission would be electronic submission to Cheryl.brimmer@va.gov.
The general scope of this project is to provide a design to renovate the auditorium of building 92 to add absorptive materials, improve lighting, acoustics, and decor. Building 92 was built in 1957 and contains a bowling alley, recreation facilities, an auditorium, and the education department.  The auditorium occupies approximately 4,587 square feet, has 325 fixed seats, a 1500 sf stage, with 550 sf of dressing rooms.  A recent project updated the heating and air-conditioning for the entire building, therefore no upgrade is required.  The existing seating, finishes, acoustics, and lighting need to be upgraded and improved.

A/E SCOPE OF SERVICES.

4.	Assess the intent and scope of this project and work with the Medical Center staff to develop a final design and cost estimate to best suit the needs and constraints of the government, while incorporating VAMC Bath Engineering Service, VA Network 2, or any other government comments.

5.	Provide two (2) sets of "Architectural E1" (30"x42") size working drawings, specifications, and cost estimate at the 30%, 70% and the 100% design review stage.

Additionally provide electronic copies of the final design submission in both AutoCad and PDF formats. (AutoCAD format must be no earlier than AutoCAD 2006 version and no newer than AutoCAD 2011.)

6.	Project completion of construction documents, including final design, contract drawings, specifications, and cost estimate is to be 180 days from contract award.

7.	Provide a detailed material/ labor cost estimate for construction of this project at the 100% design review stage. 

8.	Create list of all items required to be submitted on by the project specifications.  The list shall be organized by specification number, followed by the name of the item to be submitted on by specification.  This list shall be provided to VA. 

9.	Attend pre-bid job walk and provide all engineering responses to questions asked by potential bidders and issue an addendum, if necessary. 

10.	Provide a technical review of all project submittals/shop drawings related to the Project and provide all required responses to any design/conflict questions encountered in these areas during construction in an expeditious manner.

11.	Provide expeditious responses to all design/conflict questions encountered during the construction term.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Project Title: Results Oriented Management (ROM) to improve planning and accountability</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) seeks to employ a Results Oriented Management (ROM) approach to improve planning and accountability of its missioned program areas (foods, drugs, biologics, etc.), Office of the Commissioner (OC) and the Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA). In the Foods Program, FDA has begun using this approach and is seeking to continue this effort in conjunction with implementing portions of the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA). This approach is also potentially useful for FDA's other programs, including safety and efficacy of medical products and overseeing tobacco products. To ensure the success of its programs, FDA is striving to begin adopting a results-based focus for program planning and to inform decision making.</p>
<p>ROM is a management approach that integrates strategy, people, resources, processes and measurements (i.e., metrics) to improve decision-making, program implementation, transparency, and accountability. The approach focuses on achieving outcomes, identifying indicators, data collection, data analysis, and performance monitoring. This approach moves an organization away from budget, activity driven, or reaction-based operations to results-based operations.</p>
<p>FDA has begun employing a Results-Oriented Management (ROM) approach for FDA's Foods Program to evaluate the impact of capacity building efforts. The intent is to expand efforts to include additional work in the Foods Program as well as provide access to this method to other FDA programs. ROM is a management tool that will provide FDA managers with a common frame of reference and set of metrics for evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of specific FDA programs in meeting the FDA public health mission.</p>
<p>Scope</p>
<p>FDA needs assistance to develop a ROM approach for various programs across FDA that will assist senior FDA managers in effectively managing their programs and provide accountability for results. This effort requires expertise in developing results-oriented management frameworks for organizations with a public health mission.</p>
<p>A comprehensive ROM system is comprised of several components. A ROM framework (a.k.a logic model) is a management tool that describes the theory of change of a program area, links the theory of change to activities and outputs generated by the organization, and finally, provides a method for developing meaningful performance measures by linking them to higher level outcomes (results). Together, these components provide a basic foundation for understanding ROM and how it can be used to guide program decision-making process.</p>
<p>Responses must include capability statements and duns number be sent to this notice no later than 10:00 a.m. EST on April 12, 2012 submitted by email to vida.niles@fda.hhs.gov,Vida Niles, Contract Specialist for consideration. Responses to this announcement will not be returned, nor will there be any ensuing discussions or debriefings of any responses. However, information obtained as a result of this announcement may be reflected in the subsequent solicitation, and FDA may contact one or more respondents for clarifications and to enhance the Government's understanding. This announcement is Government market research, and may result in revisions in both its requirements and its acquisition strategy based on industry responses.<br />NO TELEPHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED.</p>

<DESC>Solicitation Number: <br />AG-3198-S-12-0015
<p>Notice Type: <br />Sources Sought</p>
<p><br />SCHOOL NUTRITION AND MEAL COST STUDY</p>
<p>This is a Sources Sought Notice for market research purposes only and is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). A solicitation is not being issued at this time and this notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service intend to issue a competitive procurement for advisory and assistance services to conduct a national School Nutrition and Meal Cost Study. Section 208 of the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (Public Law No. 111-296, henceforth "HHFKA") requires the Secretary to issue Nutrition Standards for the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and School Breakfast Program (SBP). The Nutrition Standards (7 CFR Parts 210 and 220) and other requirements of HHFKA change the way in which School Food Authorities (SFAs) plan, offer and price meals to participants, improve the composition of meals and their nutrient quality, restrict and alter the pricing of competitive foods sold in schools, adjust eligibility for free and reduced price meal reimbursements, and increase reimbursements for NSLP lunches. These changes are expected to have significant effects on SFA operations, meal quality, and costs. With the implementation of the new meals, the Food and Nutrition Service needs to determine the success of school meals meeting the new program goals, the cost of serving healthful meals acceptable to children, and the relationship of school menus and competitive foods to children's participation and diets. FNS plans the study to examine the relationship among:</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; School environments and school food service operations<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nutritional quality of meals offered and served<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; Costs to produce reimbursable meals<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; Student participation<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; Participant characteristics<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; Participant dietary intakes<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; Participant satisfaction with school meals<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; Participant attitudes toward school lunch and breakfast programs</p>
<p>FNS plans to conduct the Primary data collections in SY 2014-2015.</p>
<p>FNS is seeking firms with the capability of providing a team including all of the following:</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; A dedicated project director who can deliver high quality work, adhere to project schedules, keep costs within budget, manage the work of many professionals on many tasks simultaneously, and contribute knowledge and understanding of FNS programs.<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; Staff experienced in highly technical sampling techniques to obtain representative samples of FNS programs and/or participants and the development of corresponding sample weights for complex sample designs. <br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; Staff experienced with developing comprehensive national study designs to address numerous complex interrelated research questions, questionnaires for computer assisted data collection or hard-copy completion and OMB Information Collection Packages.<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; Experienced survey managers who can recruit a sufficient number of capable data collectors to provide information nationwide and over a short period of time; can train and monitor data collectors' performance to collect high quality data and minimize non-response.<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; Experienced data collectors and interviewers who are proficient at collecting information from a wide variety of sources (e.g., State agencies, school administrative staff, foodservice staff, families with school-aged children, etc.) using a variety of data collection techniques (e.g., CATI/CAPI data collection, on-site observation, record abstraction, etc.)<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; Staff experienced with and demonstrated proficiency in using analytic methods, including mathematical modeling, multivariate regression analysis; and descriptive and inferential statistics. Staff with proficiency in manipulating large complex databases, using mainstream software packages, synthesizing results from multiple research sources, performing literature searches and reviews, conducting nutrient, food group and other complex analyses; statistical adjustment for complex sample design; imputation; non-response bias analysis and correction; and creating complex, large scale databases accessible to any proficient database programmer.<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; Staff who have the necessary skills and experience to produce high quality, well edited reports which may be targeted to technical readers or to policy officials. Staff who can produce briefing materials (including PowerPoint presentations) and present study findings for technical and/or policy staff.<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; Staff who have knowledge of the operational and financial management aspects of the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program including special assistance alternatives, program integrity issues, nutritional quality of school meals offered, and issues related to participation in these programs.<br /><br />The firm must demonstrate how it would design a study that addresses all of the areas identified above. Of particular interest is the study design component that would be used to examine the impacts of the Nutrition Standards on program participation, nutritional quality of meals and costs. The firm should identify what outcome measures would be used and how external factors would be controlled to identify impacts attributable to the Nutrition Standards for the NSLP and SBP.</p>
<p>Interested parties should submit capability statements that demonstrate its ability to provide the appropriate staff experience and skill set required and the technical approach they would propose to conduct a national School Nutrition and Meal Cost Study. In addition, interested parties must include a description of past experience and successful completion and publication of at least two (2) similar projects consistent in scope, size and complexity with this requirement which has been performed in the past three years and past performance ratings on these projects.</p>

<DESC>The United States Coast Guard, Aviation Logistics Center (ALC), Medium Range Surveillance (MRS) Division, Elizabeth City, North Carolina is conducting market research for HC-144A Sustaining Engineering Services. This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a sources sought notice only. This is NOT a request for proposal and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. The purpose of this sources sought notice is to gain knowledge of commercially available products or services that may be of interest to the United States Coast Guard (USCG).
<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> <br />The U.S. Coast Guard is operating a fleet of CN-235-300M aircraft manufactured by Airbus Military in Seville, Spain. These aircraft are operated differently from those in general aviation; Coast Guard missions require frequent operation within salt-laden environments, and conditions, which accelerate the corrosive attack on the airframe structures and components of the CN-235-300 aircraft. Inspection of these aircraft in accordance with the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) periodic requirements under the U.S. Coast Guard's specialized Asset Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS), historically reveals corrosion damage and operational wear and tear associated with aging aircraft, which is often outside the scope of OEM published repair limits and specifications. These services are necessary for the continued support of the CN-235-300M aircraft structures and components assuring the missions and operational readiness of U.S. Coast Guard fleet of HC-144A aircraft.</p>
<p><strong>SYNOPSIS:<br /></strong>The Coast Guard's objectives are to obtain engineering services and documentation necessary to support and maintain, in airworthy condition, the airframe structures, systems, and components, as used on the U.S. Coast Guard HC-144A aircraft on an as needed basis.</p>
<p>Please respond to the following questions: (1) Is your business a large or small business and how many employees? (2) If small, does your firm qualify as a small, emergent business, or a small disadvantaged business? (3) If disadvantaged, specify under which disadvantaged group and is your firm certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act? (4) Is your firm a certified hub zone firm? (5) Is your firm a woman-owned or operated business? (6) Is your firm a certified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned? (7) Is your product listed on a GSA schedule? (8) Do you have other government agencies using the product, and if so which agencies, POCs and contract numbers? (9) If possible, any POCs for civilian users for general usage of product questions.</p>
<p>After review of the responses to this sources sought announcement, and if the USCG decides to proceed with an acquisition, a solicitation announcement will be published in the Federal Business Opportunity (FBO). Again, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">this is not a request for proposals</span></strong> and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. Responses to this sources notice shall be emailed to Kia.R.Walton@uscg.mil. TELEPHONE RESPONSES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. <strong>Responses must be received no later than 11 April 2012 at 4:00pm Eastern Time.</strong> Firms responding to this announcement that fail to provide all of the required information cannot be used to help the USCG make the appropriate acquisition decisions which is the intent of this sources sought notice. This notice is to assist the USCG in identifying potential sources only. All firms responding to this sources sought notice are advised that their response to this notice is not a request to be considered for a contract award. All interested parties must respond to any subsequent solicitation announcement separately from the responses to this announcement. Responses to this sources sought notice are NOT a request to be added to a prospective offerors list or to receive a copy of the solicitation.</p>
<p>THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED. This request for information is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an Invitation for Bid (IFB), Request for Quotation (RFQ), or Request for Proposal (RFP), or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. Your responses to this sources sought will be treated as informational only. No entitlement to payment or direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this sources sought or Government use of such information. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or part, any contractor input resulting from this sources sought. The information resulting from this sources sought may be included in one or more RFP's, which may be released via the FedBizOpps.gov portal.</p>

<SUBJECT>Request for Information (RFI) currency reader to denominate U.S. currency 
<SOLNBR>BEP-RFI-12-0005
<RESPDATE>043012
<CONTACT>Kathleen E Reidy, Email kathleen.reidy@bep.treas.gov
<DESC>The U. S. Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP), is interested in obtaining, testing, and evaluating technologies with potential application as a device-assisted, user-interpreted portable currency reader to denominate U.S. currency (Federal Reserve notes) produced from 1995 to present.
<p>BACKGROUND:<br />On October 3, 2008 the United States District Court for the District of Columbia issued its ruling in ACB vs. Paulson requiring the Secretary of the Treasury provide meaningful access to U.S. currency for the blind and visually impaired by the next currency redesign. Even before the Court's ruling, BEP commissioned a study to review and analyze the needs of the blind and visually impaired. The study can be found on BEP's website at http://www.moneyfactory.gov/uscurrency/meaningfulaccess.html. After the completion of the study BEP proposed three recommended accommodations, which the Secretary of the Treasury has approved:</p>
<p>1. Tactile Feature: Adding a raised tactile feature to U.S. currency unique to each U.S. Federal Reserve note that BEP may lawfully change,</p>
<p>2. High Contrast Numerals: Continuing the program of adding large high contrast numerals and different colors to each denomination that BEP is permitted by law to alter.</p>
<p>3. Currency Reader Program: A supplemental currency reader distribution program for blind and visually impaired U.S. citizens and those legally residing in the U.S.</p>
<p>BEP will establish a process to loan and distribute currency readers to the blind and visually impaired at no cost to them as an interim solution to provide accessibility to U.S. currency prior to the distribution and full circulation of the currency redesigned with tactile features. In order to develop an effective currency reader distribution program, BEP seeks to better understand the current and potential market for currency readers, including the range of models and features available to U.S. individuals, manufacturing and distribution processes, and costs to produce and maintain these devices.</p>
<p><br />Based on the study findings, the number of blind or visually impaired individuals who found it difficult or impossible to denominate U.S. currency visually was estimated to be 4,371,369. The study projected this number to increase to 4,895,933 individuals by 2020. BEP makes no guarantee as to the number of currency reader devices that may be required under its currency reader distribution program.</p>
<p>Submission of actual devices is not required under this RFI, but devices may be provided for consideration by BEP. If provided, they will be assessed for compatibility with current U.S. currency designs and will be reviewed for inherent, relative effectiveness as a currency reader device. All devices will be returned at the end of the market research process.</p>
<p><br />REQUEST FOR INFORMATION:</p>
<p>Respondents are asked to provide information in response to the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Please provide a brief description of your company's history and its experience in manufacturing and distributing a currency reader device.<br />&bull; Please describe how your device denominates U.S. currency.<br />&bull; Please describe the features of the device including any of the following that apply: dimension, weight, voice options, languages, privacy mode, accuracy, speed, and other features. <br />&bull; Please describe any attributes that improve ease of use of your device by the blind and visually impaired.<br />&bull; What is the current retail unit price for your device, including shipping?<br />&bull; Do you offer bulk rate pricing?

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Yuma Area Office (YAO), Yuma, Arizona, 85364, intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis as provided under FAR 6.302-1; only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements with Phoenix Pumps, Inc, 3552 E. Corona Avenue, Phoenix AZ 85040. The requirement is for procurement of Floway brand turbine pump and motor system replacements to include pump bowl assemblies, column pipe, 40-250HP motor and shaft assemblies, line shafts and couplings.
The pumps will be used for operation of the 242, South Gila, Yuma Valley and Yuma Mesa Wellfields in the Yuma, AZ area.  The turbine pumps must be manufactured by Weir Floway because YAO standardized the well operations for efficiency and to achieve cost savings that will enable YAO to prevent costly down time since the spare parts in stock can be used with the new replacement pumps.  If another pump brand is purchased, it would require that all well pumps be replaced and existing stocked spare parts would become obsolete.  All the YAO operational wells use Floway brand products in their operation and an inventory of Floway pumps and motors are maintained for standardization and operational consistency.  
The NAICS Code for this action is 333911 Pump and Pumping Equipment Manufacturing with a Small Business Size Standard of 500 employees.
This procurement will be awarded using FAR Part 15 Negotiation procedures with an intended performance period of a Base Year and four Option Years.  Anticipated award date is May 31, 2012.   
All responsible sources may submit a capability statement or proposal which shall be considered by the agency by April 11, 2012. 
The contract award information will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at www.fedbizopps.gov.  The Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition will be made available for public inspection as required by FAR 6.305.

You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.  However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the Total and Broad Government Requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>

<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to the federal government.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than April 11, 2011 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis.  Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to&nbsp;(703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.  If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>

THE TECHNOLOGY: NASA Langley Research Center has developed a point sensor and piezoelectric actuatorsystem to actively sense and reduce vibrations in flexible structures. Miniatureaccelerometers sense vibration and feed signals to control circuits that condition andamplify the signal. Interdigitated electrodes in the actuator apply an in-plane voltagedifferential across the piezoelectric material, causing compressive stress contrary tothe vibration of the structure.

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits interest from companiesinterested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market thefollowing technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basisand may include specific fields of use. THE TECHNOLOGY: NASA Langley has developed a novel method of depositing metal and metal oxidenanoparticles onto various substrates (see ACS Nano, 3(4), 871884 [2009]). It is rapid,scalable, and green since it does not require reducing agents or solvents. The processinvolves first mixing and then heating a metal salt (usually an acetate) with the desiredsubstrate. Heating can be done by conventional thermal or microwave ovens. Conventionalthermal processing takes several hours and requires an inert atmosphere, usuallynitrogen. With microwave heating, the process is complete in a matter of seconds. Themetal or metal oxide nanoparticles have potential use in electromagnetic applications.The nanoparticles have been evaluated for electromagnetic properties at high frequenciesfor potential antenna applications (S. Ghose, et al.

<DESC>***NOAA's Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, Western Acquisition Division-Seattle, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Biomark Inc. to provide FS1001M 6-Port Multiplex Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tag detection transceiver, Multiple Transceiver System Master Controller, and IS 1001 (Nodes).
<p><br />***The sole source determination is based on the National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Fish Ecology (FE) Division requirement to provide one FS1001M 6-Port Multiplex Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tag detection transceiver, one Multiple Transceiver System Master Controller, and four IS 1001 (Nodes) individual port controllers. The delivery date is July 31, 2012.</p>
<p><br />Biomark is the exclusive distributor of Digital Angel Corp. PIT tags and tag detection electronics. Specifically, no other vendor can meet the FE requirements for the FS1001M multiplexing, auto-tuning, six channel Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tag detection transceivers. It is critical for the transceivers to match the existing system used by the FE Division. Digital Angel is the only company that produces a FDX multiplexing transceiver capable of controlling up to six antennas that can automatically tune each antenna as environmental conditions change.</p>

<p><br />Synopsis:<br />THIS IS A SPECIAL NOTICE ONLY. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) has requirements to:</p>
<p>(1) Procure on a sole source basis, a basic handheld radiation detection/identification system from Smiths Detection, Inc. in fiscal year (FY) 2012 at an estimated value of $3.35M. This sole source procurement is a follow-on contract to previous contract number HSHQDC-07-D-00016 for immediate production of handheld radiation detection/identification systems to meet the immediate need of DHS's operational components. The Justification for that procurement will be separately published.</p>
<p>(2) Procure on a competitive basis, a basic handheld radiation detection/identification system to meet DHS's operational components' needs in FYs 2013 through 2017. DNDO intends to issue a solicitation on a full and open competition basis to procure these systems. The government expects the solicitation to be released via FEDBIZOPPS in the summer of 2012 and is not seeking proposals from industry at this time. Additional information regarding the competitive procurement is provided below.</p>
<p>&bull; Competition Type: Full and open competition based upon Best Value with a base and option periods.</p>
<p>&bull; Description of the Requirement: The government's requirements for a Basic Handheld Radiation Detection/Identification System will be provided in the solicitation. These requirements will include the minimum needs (i.e., radiation detection, isotope identification, gain stabilization, weight, ruggedness, ability to download data files, alternative technology to 3He based neutron detection, etc.) for a Basic Handheld system that will be used to evaluate proposals using the best value method of evaluation.</p>
<p>Vendors will be required to comply strictly with the instructions provided in the solicitation and to provide adequate references and documentation to substantiate the ability to meet the requirements. In addition to the proposal responses and evaluation of their ability to meet the government's requirements, vendors are likely to be required to (1) conduct an operational capability demonstration (OCD) to support the Government's ability to obtain empirical knowledge of the Offerors' proposed system in an operationally relevant environment. Observations documented by the Government combined with the Offeror's OCD Report may be used to evaluate technical and operational performance requirements; (2) provide production ready systems and the associated algorithm Replay Tool to support government-led testing and evaluation; (3) assist the Government in using a vendor supplied algorithm Replay Tool to validate isotope identification performance and model the threat space, nuisance source population, false alarm rate, and ambient background. Vendors will be required to submit documentation to the government verifying the version of the system tested and its ability to meet the requirements provided.</p>

<DESC>This is a sole source announcement.  No solicitation will be prepared or madeavailable.  The  Information Assurance Branch (Code 58110) of the Space andNaval Warfare Systems Center Pacific (SPAWAR SSC Pacific) intends to issue asole source, firm fixed price contract to General Dynamics, 77 A Street,Needham, MA 02494-2806 for the purchase of 300 refurbished KG-175 Encrytors forconducting IT processes securely in a shipboard environment.   These encryptordevices enable vital communication links between ship and shore, including theshipboard use of SIPRNET to support warfighter communications.Authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) andFAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services willsatisfy agency requirements.The Automated Digital Network System (ADNS) is the backbone to the JointMaritime Communications Strategy (JMCOMS).  ADNS uses protocols, processors androuters, and NSA certified cryprographic products to create a robust andflexible networking environment.  The currently deployed ADNS operationalcapability relies on the use of RECIPE (Remote Encryptor ConfigurationInformation Protocol) to successfully route network traffic between sources anddestinations.  The RECIPE  protocol is a proprietary protocol developed byGeneral Dynamics and it is only available in the KG-175 product.  NeitherGeneral Dynamics nor any other manufacturer currently produces the KG-I75. Andbecause of the restrictions associated with cryptographic hardware, it is notavailable through any 3rd party reseller. General Dynamics has the capabilityto refurbish these units utilizing the proprietory RECIPE technology.This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interestedparties may identify their interest and capability to respond to therequirement or submit proposals.  Information received will normally beconsidered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct acompetitive procurement.  A determination by the Government to compete theproposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within thediscretion of the Government.The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is334119. The estimated value of the effort is $1,950,000.  Questions concerningthis sole source contract action may be directed to Cathy Moore at SPAWAR SSCPacific, 53560 Hull Street, San Diego, CA 92152-5001; email:cathy.moore@navy.mil;Questions and/or responses are due by 12 April 2012.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command Quantico, Virginia intends to modify existing Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity combination type, contract M67854-05-D-6014 Expeditionary Fire Support Systems/Internally Transportable Vehicle (EFSS/ITV) with  General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems  Large Caliber Ammunition (GD-OTS LCA), 11399 16th Court North, St. Petersburg, FL 33716 on a sole source basis in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This intent is subject to final approval in accordance with FAR 6.304.

The proposed contract action extends the period of performance, under the existing contract logistics support order, from March 31, 2012 to June 30, 2012.
  This extension will further allow for the current follow-on competitive procurement to be accomplished and to allow for a transition of services to a potential new contractor to occur in a timeframe that will not impact imminent logistics support activities.  To that effect additional work will be added; to support an imminent fielding event,  incorporate revisions to production items and technical manuals as a result of  engineering change proposals,  continue provisioning effort and to allow repairs to be made to GFM. The estimated increase to the contract value is approximately $3M. GD-OTS LCA is the only responsible source for the effort as the Government would incur unacceptable delays and costs in fulfilling the agencys requirements if this extension was not exercised before the current contract expiration date.
 

This notice to extend contract services is not a request for competitive proposals. The extended period of performance of the contract is three (3) months. This extension of services was limited to the least amount of time necessary to obtain full and open competition as soon as possible. A determination not to compete this proposed contract extension is solely within the discretion of the Government. 

The point of contact for this acquisition is Contract Specialist, Larry Gillman; Email, larry.gillman@usmc.mil. Phone calls will not be accepted.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared inaccordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additionalinformation included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the onlysolicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for a Developmental SingleBoard Computer (single board) to meet the minimum requirements. The Governments minimumrequirements are listed in the Statement of Work (SOW).  The SOW may be accessed at:http://procurement.jsc.nasa.gov/NNJ12421704Q/Final-SOW_SBC_revA.DOCX  NASA/JSC intends to make multiple awards to more than one offeror to procure the singleboard. The Government has the option to purchase multiple single boards from thesuccessful offerors.  This solicitation is for the acquisition of a Developmental Single Board Computer fortesting and qualification to be approved in future space missions.  The acquisition willbe conducted as a three-step procurement using a progressive down-selection techniquebetween phases.  In this technique, multiple offerors will be selected for Phase 1.  Itis expected that the successful offeror(s) for Phase 2 and Phase 3 will be chosen fromamong the successful offerors of Phase 1 after evaluation and testing. Phase 1 is for the Developmental Single Board computer.  Phase 2 & 3 is for theEngineering and Flight Boards, respectively.The competition for Phase 2 and Phase 3 will be based on the results of Phase 1, and theaward criteria for Phase 2 and Phase 3 will include successful completion of Phase 1requirements. NASA/JSC does not intend to issue separate, formal solicitations for Phase 2 and Phase 3.  Phase 2 and Phase 3 proposals will be requested from the Phase 1 successful offerors,via a letter. All information required for preparation of Phase 2 and 3 proposals,including the final evaluation criteria and factors, will be provided at that time.Phase 2 and Phase 3 will be synopsized in the Government point of entry in accordancewith FAR 5.201 and 5.203 unless one of the exceptions in FAR 5.202 apply.  Notwithstanding NASA's expectation that only the Phase 1 successful offerors will becapable of successfully competing for Phase 2 and Phase 3, all proposals will beconsidered.  Any other responsible source may indicate its desire to submit a proposal byresponding to the Phase 2 and Phase 3 synopsis, and NASA will provide that source all theinformation furnished to the Phase 1 offerors necessary to submit a proposal. To be considered for Phase 2 and Phase 3 awards, offerors must demonstrate a designmaturity and NASA testing equivalent to that of the Phase 1 successful offerors.  Failureto fully and completely demonstrate the appropriate level of design maturity may renderthe proposal unacceptable with no further consideration for contract award.Although NASA will request Phase 2 and Phase 3 proposals from Phase 1 successfulofferors, submission of Phase 2 and Phase 3 proposals is not a requirement of the Phase 1solicitation/contract. Accordingly, the costs of preparing these proposals shall not be adirect charge to the Phase 1 contract, if applicable.   The anticipated schedule for conducting this phased procurement is provided for yourinformation.   These dates are projections only and are not intended to commit NASA tocomplete a particular action at a given time.

THE FOLLOWING PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES ARE APPLICABLE AND ARE HEREBY INCORPORATED INTO THE SOLICITATION BY REFERENCE AND BY FULL TEXT (Listed Below).

THE FULL TEXT OF THE CLAUSES/PROVISIONS FROM THE FAR AND DFARS CAN BE ACCESSED VIA THE INTERNET USING THE FOLLOWING WEB-SITE ADDRESS: www.arnet.gov or http://farsite.hill.af.mil

It is the responsibility of the Quoting Contractor(s) to obtain copies of the necessary provisions and or clauses that are required as a part of this solicitation.
  Required clauses/provisions that are not submitted may render a contractor(s) quote(s) to not be accepted by the Government. 

FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items

NOTE: This provision must be reviewed completely. It contains the guidelines for submission of your quotation. In addition, Quoting Contractors are instructed to complete and submit the attached past performance survey (found on the NECO site) with submitted quotes prior to the closing date of this notice specified herein.   

FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation of Commercial Items; 

(a)  The Government plans to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Quoting Contractor whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.
  The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes.  

     (i)  CAPABILITY TO PERFORM
    (ii)  PAST PERFORMANCE
    (iii)  PRICE

(b)  Only those Quoting Contractors which are determined by the contracting officer to be technically capable of performing under Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii) and (iii).  In the second step of evaluating quotes determined under Factor (i) to be technically acceptable, Factor (ii), PAST PERFORMANCE, is as important as Factor (iii), PRICE.  

At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate quotes and award a purchase order without discussions with Quoting Contractors.  Each initial quote should, therefore contain the Quoting Contractors best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.
   

(c)  By submitting a signed quote under this solicitation, Contractor asserts that it is technically capable of performing the specification/ statement of work and all aspects of this contract.  The contracting officer will validate contractors technical capability to perform by verifying that the contractor that supplied a quote has financial resources, organization and facilities required to perform the contract.  TECHNICAL CAPABILITY TO PERFORM represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.  Under this factor, contractors will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to be determined technically acceptable under this factor will render the quote to be unacceptable and to not be considered for award.
  

(d)  Quoting Contractors PAST PERFORMANCE information will be used to make a determination of whether the contractor supplying a quote has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Contractors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years with submitted quotes. 

PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation (posted on the NECO site).  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources that may have relevant information. 

A quoting Contractor which lacks relevant past performance history will receive a NEUTRAL rating for this factor.
  Any Quoting Contractor which has no relevant past performance history, while rated NEUTRAL, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the other quotes received.

The Contracting Officer will evaluate Quoting Contractors PAST PERFORMANCE as follows:

NEUTRAL:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.  Quoting Contractor has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives demerit for this factor.

OUTSTANDING:   No risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the quoting Contractor's past performance.

SATISFACTORY:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the Quoting Contractor's past performance.

MARGINAL:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the Quoting Contractor's past performance.


A written notice of award otherwise furnished to the successful Quoting Contractor within the time for acceptance specified in the quote, shall result in a purchase order without further action by either party.
  Before the quote's specified expiration time, the Government may place a purchase order, whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), Bethesda, Maryland, intends to negotiate a on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR Part 13.106-1 with Fibergate, Inc in Alexandria, VA, for the following service:<br /><br />Lease and Maintenance of Dark Fiber Connection between USUHS Room G007 and 6700 Rockledge Dr<br /><br />This service will be procured as a commercial item in accordance with the procedures in FAR Part 12 (Acquisition of Commercial Items) and FAR Part 13 (Simplified Acquisition Procedures).
<p>Scope of work: Lease and Maintenance of 2 fibers (1 Pair); less than 7 miles; point to point: USUHS Room G007 to 6700A Rockledge Dr, 2nd Floor. The cables were installed and the connections established in 2008 and Fibergate has provided continuous coverage since then.</p>
<p>Period of Performance</p>
<p>Base Year: 26 March 2012 - 25 March 2013<br />OYI: 26 March 2013 - 25 March 2014<br />OYII: 26 March 2014 - 25 March 2015<br />OYIII: 26 March 2015 - 25 March 2016</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on Fibergate owning the existing fiber cables connecting the University to its other remote sites and has fiber in place from USUHS to Rockledge. As this service need is continuous, the time frame and cost necessary to install new cables is prohibitive, therefore Fibergate is the one source reasonably available to meet the needs of the government.</p>
<p>This is not a request for quote. However, all interested parties may contact the Contract Specialist listed below. Sources interested in responding to this requirement must be able to provide compelling evidence that they can provide lease and maintenance of fiber cables immediately and without incurring construction costs. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contractual action based upon responses received is solely within the discretion of the government. Responses must be submitted electronically, via email, to carolyn.randolph@usuhs.edu. The deadline for the submittal of responses is 6 April 2012, 5:00 pm EST.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<DESC>Provide materials, labor, and supervision to prepare approximately 1,765 square feet of concrete floor with a seamless decorative resin flooring system. The floor is located in the Men's Varsity Locker Room in Roland Hall at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy. Total square footage includes floor area plus a five and a half (5 &frac12;) inch high footing that the lockers sit on plus a five and a half (5 &frac12;) inch high cove base along all concrete walls and column bases. Five and a half (5 &frac12;) inch cove base totals 621 linear feet. Contractor is responsible for all prep work needed to ensure proper adhesion of flooring system to locker footings, wall and column bases. See Appendix A for pictures of project site. The coating of choice is produced by D&uuml;raamen Engineered Products, Inc. and is their "Fog" colored 1/8" double broadcasted kw&ouml;rtz flooring system, but a product of similar composition and color would also be considered. Final finish must be non-slip with a coefficient of friction of at least 0.5. Durability is a concern in this space as athletes sometimes wear their metal cleats in the locker room. Only products that can stand up to metal cleat traffic should be included in bid.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

D.  QUALITY CONTROL   The contractor shall develop and maintain an effective internal quality control program to ensure that services performed are in accordance with the PWS.  The contractor shall develop and implement procedures to identify, prevent and ensure non-recurrence of defective services.  As a minimum requirement, the contractor shall internally develop quality control procedures that address the areas identified below in the Government's Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP).   This QASP provides a systematic method of evaluating performance against the Performance Standards.  This QASP will provide answers to the following questions: What will be monitored? How will monitoring take place? How will monitoring efforts and results be documented?  

This QASP does not detail how the Contractor accomplishes the work.  Rather, it has been created with the premise that the Contractor is responsible for the management and quality control actions necessary to meeting the terms of the contract.  It is the Government's responsibility to be objective, fair and consistent in evaluating performance.  This QASP is a "living process," and the Government may review and revise it on a regular basis.  However, the Government will coordinate all changes with the Contractor.

1. QASP Objective
The QASP is designated to provide the COR with an effective and systematic surveillance method to perform inspections so that the Government can ensure that services are provided to an acceptable quality level.

2. Monitoring

As described below under "Surveillance Methods," this QASP directs the monitoring of the Contractor's performance of the work defined in the Performance Work Statement (PWS).

3.	Performance Indicators and Acceptable Quality Levels
Performance measures and acceptable quality levels are described in the Performance Requirements Summary (PRS), paragraph 5 below.

a)	Surveillance Methods
1)	The Program Manager (PM) and COR will perform 100-percent inspection of the services covered under the contract.  This means that every time a task is performed or items are delivered, inspection will be accomplished.  The COR will certify an invoice for payment processing after the PM receives and recommends acceptance of the services/deliverable.  This process will be used for approval of payment for the Contractor's invoices and will serve as the mechanism to document that the overall performance of the Contractor has been acceptable for the period of time covered by the invoice.   

2)	The PM and COR will receive all documents as noted in the performance report survey (PRS).  The Contractor shall document performance on a monthly performance report and on the PRS.  The COR will review and accept or reject the performance as shown, documenting corrective actions needed for each performance standard as outlined in the PRS.  Following the review of the monthly performance report and the PRS, the Contractor shall complete the corrective action(s) necessary to meet performance standards and document that activity in their next monthly report.

3)	Any non-conformance with contract requirements is considered a deficiency.  The term "deficiency" refers to an output that does not meet the contract standards and is therefore recorded as "unacceptable."  When an "unacceptable rating" is recorded by the COR, the specific reason for the unacceptable performance will be recorded in the COR surveillance file, along with the date of the deficiency.  

4)	The COR will require the Contractor to correct the unacceptable performance or delivery immediately, if possible, and document in their COR file the status of the deficiency.  Corrections by the Contractor shall still be counted as a deficiency.  

5)	The PM shall notify the COR of deficiencies.  The COR will contact the responsible Contractor representative to inform them of the deficiency.  The COR shall note the date and time the deficiency was discussed with the Contractor representative in their surveillance file.  

6)	The VHA PM shall review the corrective actions taken by the Contractor to resolve a discrepancy and shall notify the COR of acceptance.

7)	The VHA PM or the COR will immediately notify the Contracting Officer (CO) of serious performance problems that jeopardize the overall successful completion of the contract or are continually encountered.  The CO will determine the appropriate response to make to correct the situation and protect the Government's interest.

b) Acceptable Quality Level
For this effort, the only Acceptable Quality Level is 100-percent conformance.  The Surveillance Method will be 100-percent inspection of tasks and deliverables.

c)	Performance Requirements Summary (PRS)

For all of the tasks defined below, the Performance Standard is defined as "Work being completed within established timeframes."  A formal "Inspection Checklist" may be used and adjusted as the COR determines appropriate to fit the need.  Revisions to this QASP may be made during the life of the contract.  Revisions, if needed, will be requested by the COR to the CO.  The CO will formally incorporate the change(s), in writing, prior to implementation.

Performance Indicator	Performance Standard
 
	Minimum Acceptable Standard	Method of Surveillance	Frequency
Contractor Project Management Plan (CPMP)	Contractor Project Management Plan (CPMP) is comprehensive, risks are identified, and quantified and include a mitigation plan; schedules present a work breakdown structure including associated activities with start and finish dates and communications address internal and external customers and stakeholders.  Updates are provided in a timely manner and are thorough and complete. 	Two or less instances where significant errors or omissions were identified	100%	Quarterly CPMP Reviews
Reports  	Reports are submitted on time and include those topics described in the Performance Work Statement, agreed to in the Project Management Plan and as requested for special reports; necessary clearances are obtained as needed in a timely manner.	Two or fewer instances where significant errors or omissions were identified	100%	Monthly Reports
Customer Service and Project Coordination	Contractor demonstrates sound customer service principles and project coordination efforts are timely, appropriate and cooperative to EES	Zero instances where significant errors or omissions were identified	100%	Contractor's Monthly Reports
Online Music and Sound Effect Libraries	Music and sound effects are diverse, accessible 24X7X365 to EES Producers	Zero instances where significant errors or omissions were identified	100%	Deliverables
Table 2, Performance Requirements Summary

E.  Changes to the PWS:  Any changes to this PWS shall be authorized and approved only through written correspondence from the Contracting Officer.  A copy of each change will be kept in a project folder along with all other products of the project.  Costs incurred by the contractor through the actions of parties other than the Contracting Officer shall be borne by the contractor. 
F.  TRAVEL: Travel and per diem is a cost reimbursable item and shall be reimbursed in accordance with VA/Federal Travel Regulations (FTR). Each contractor invoice must include copies of ALL receipts that support the travel costs claimed in the invoice.  The contractor is only entitled to actual cost spent while on travel that falls within the perimeters as set forth within the FTR, to include food.  Travel must be pre-approved by the COTR.  Travel must be priced separately in the price schedule.  Local travel within a 50-mile radius from the contractor's facility is considered the cost of doing business and will not be reimbursed.   This includes travel, subsistence, and associated labor charges for travel time.  Travel performed for personal convenience and daily travel to and from work at the contractor's facility will not be reimbursed.  Travel, subsistence, and associated labor charges for travel time for travel beyond a 50-mile radius of the contractor's facility are authorized on a case-by-case basis and must be pre-approved by the COTR estimated locations.
There is no travel anticipated for this contract.
G.  Confidentiality and Disclosure:
It is agreed that:
1. The preliminary and final deliverables, and all associated working papers, application source code, and other material deemed relevant by VA which have been generated by the contractor in the performance of this contract, are the exclusive property of the U.S. Government and shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer at the conclusion of the contract.

I-3 WAWF Instructions<br />To be eligible for contract awards from this organization, you must now use an E-invoicing system called Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF). WAWF is a web-based tool used to electronically process invoices and receiving reports. It is one of three E-Invoicing options identified in DFARS 252.232-7003, but is considered the "preferred" E-Invoicing solution within DoD. WAWF enables pre-population of data, data sharing, improved data accuracy, decreased redundant data entry, decreased lost or misplaced documents, and online access to contracts and related records. Email addresses, along with routing and location codes contained in the contract, are used to enable document access and alert users of pending document actions and status. Contractors benefit via increased cash flow and the DoD benefits via reduced interest penalty payments.</p>
<p>To gain access to the WAWF production system, contractors must acquire an account for their company and register their employees to use the system. There is no charge to register for or to use WAWF. Registration instructions and online training are available at www.wawftraining.com. Contractors must possess a Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, maintain a current registration in the Contractor Central Registration database and identify an Electronic Business Point of Contact.</p>
<p>For security purposes, WAWF user identity is assured via Public Key Infrastructure authentication methods which enable structured user IDs, secure passwords and/or digital certificate capability. Documents are verified via digital signature and transmissions are processed with secure audit capability. A review of the online training module "Determine Type of Document to Create" under Vendor Training at www.wawftraining.com is recommended. Questions on WAWF may be directed to the WAWF Help Desk (available 24/7) at 866-618-5988.</p>

   The following provisions are incorporated into 52.212-1 as an addendum to this solicitation:
	52.217-5	EVALUATION OF OPTIONS	JUL 1990
	52.225-25	PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTING WITH	NOV 2011

  E.1  52.212-2  EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)
 
   (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government based on the evaluation factors below. The Government intends to award without discussion with respective offerors. Therefore, the Offeror's initial proposal should contain the best terms from a technical and price standpoint. The Government however, reserves the rights to conduct discussion if deemed to be in its best interest. Furthermore, if discussions are to be conducted the Government will establish a competitive range. The competitive range shall be comprised of the most highly rated proposals, unless the range is further reduced for purposes of efficiency pursuant to FAR 15.306 (c) (2). The evaluation factors used to evaluate offers are as follows:

    Technical Acceptability
    Past Performance
    Price
 
   Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price.
 
   (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
 
   (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

     (1) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
 
     (2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;
 
     (3) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
 
     (4) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
 
       (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
 
         (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
 
         (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
 
       (ii) Examples.
 
         (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
 
         (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
 
         (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
 
         (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
 
   (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
 
     (1) Listed end products.

     (2) __ Outside the United States.

       (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and
 
       (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
 
     (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--
 
       (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
 
       (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.
 
   (l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701).  (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)

                         (End of Provision)
 
   (e) EVALUATION APPROACH
 
 1. TECHNICAL:
 
 (i) Assessment:  The Government will assess each area of the technical proposal to ensure the offeror meets or exceeds the standards of the contract.  The Government will evaluate the technical proposal based on the information provided in the Technical Volume.  The Government will infer from the offeror's responses to the required information the offeror's capability to perform to the requirements of the entire SOW.  In order to be considered for award, the offeror must demonstrate the ability to provide adequate and qualified staff and expertise to satisfy the statement of work requirements by describing or providing the information requested in the Technical Volume
 
  2.  PAST PERFORMANCE:
 
 (i) Factor Assessment: The purpose of Past Performance evaluation is to assess the degree of confidence the Government will have in an Offeror's ability to provide services that meet customer needs.  The Past Performance evaluation will assess how relevant the Offeror's contracts on previous efforts of similar size and scope to this acquisition have been rated by their customers.  The evaluation will focus on and target performance that is relevant to the principal tasks of the SOW, (i.e. providing annual preventive maintenance services for Arjo Patient Lifting Devices as stated in the SOW).   More recent and relevant performance will have a greater impact on the performance confidence assessment than less recent and/or less relevant effort.  A performance confidence rating will be assigned based on the offeror's ability to perform the requirements of this solicitation
 
  (ii)  Description of factor:
 
 (A) The Government will conduct a past performance review of each competitive offeror.  Evaluations will be based on present and past performance information provided by the Offeror and gathered from various sources.  In addition to the information provided by the Offeror's customers, the Government reserves the right to use data obtained from other Government and commercial sources.
 
 (B) Recent:  A contract is considered recent when performance of the effort is ongoing or has been completed within the past 3 years.  Current performance will have a greater impact in the confidence assessment than less recent performance.
 
 (C) Relevancy:  The government will perform an independent determination of data relevancy, provided or obtained.  The main assessment of relevancy focuses on capability and magnitude.  Capability assesses whether the work being performed in the reference is similar to the work in our requirement.  Magnitude defines whether the amount of work in the reference is similar to the amount of work in our requirement.  An effort is considered relevant when there is a logical connection with document destruction services.  The scope of past performance information in value and size shall also be considered in determining relevancy.   More relevant performance will have a greater impact on the confidence assessment than less relevant effort.
 
 (D) Performance:  The government will perform an independent determination for each contract reference, provided or obtained.
 
 (iii) A lack of relevant past performance information shall be rated as an unknown performance risk, having no positive or negative significance.  A strong record of relevant or semi-relevant past performance may be considered more advantageous to the Government than a "Neutral/Unknown confidence" rating.  Likewise, a more relevant past performance record may receive a higher confidence rating and be considered more favorably than a less relevant record of favorable performance.
 
 (v) Where the performance record indicates performance problems, the Government will consider the number and severity of the problems.  The Government will also consider the appropriateness and effectiveness of any corrective actions taken (not just planned or promised) to resolve problems.  Offerors will have the opportunity to address any negative or adverse past performance information received during this evaluation (subject to the restrictions of FAR 15.306 (e) (4), for which they have not had an opportunity to address in the past.
 
 3. PRICE:
 
 (i) Factor Assessment:  This criteria evaluates the overall price (i.e. aggregate for all five years of performance) to determine if the proposed price is fair and reasonable.  The Government may determine an offer unacceptable if the proposed prices are materially unbalanced which is defined as significantly understated or overstated in relation to the actual cost of that work or when the price is determined not to be fair and reasonable. The individual unit prices listed in Price Schedule will be evaluated using the price analysis techniques prescribed by FAR 15.404-1(b).
 
 (ii) Ratings:  Price proposals will be evaluated, but not rated.
 
 (iii) Description of factor:  The Government will conduct a price review of each contract line item.  Evaluations will be based on a comparison of the aggregate price of all offerors.  The aggregate price is the sum of all contract line items 0001 through 0005.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

<p>Only with Contracting Officer approval to proceed will a contractor, technical representative, or subcontractor be reimbursed for reasonable per diem cost (transportation, travel expenses, lodging, meals, and incidental expenses) required in connection with the associated change order. Per Diem costs are considered reasonable, allowable and reimbursable only to the extent that they do not exceed the allowed per diem rate in effect at the time of travel as set forth in the Federal Travel Regulations, Joint Travel Regulations, or Standardized Regulations as set forth in FAR 31.205-46</p>
<p>Firm Fixed Price Total (includes all charges): tiny_mce_marker__________________.</p>
<p><br />TECHNICAL PROPOSAL:<br />Offeror must submit, in detail, a technical understanding of the overall scope of work and the plan to accomplish that work. Technical understanding includes the following: Identifying potential problem areas in accomplishing the work requirements, e.g., Long Lead Time Material, open and inspect items, etc, and propose solutions to those problems; demonstrate an understanding of the engineering support requirements (e.g., work drawings, tech/system manuals).</p>
<p>PAST PERFORMANCE PROPOSAL:<br />Offeror must submit, in detail, recent and relevant past performance documentation. Recent is defined as contract completion within the last three (3) years.

Therefore, price analysis per FAR 15.404-1(b) will normally be used to determine the total evaluated price to support the selection of the lowest priced, technically acceptable offeror. Although in exceptional cases when the determination of fair and reasonable price requires additional information, the PCO may conduct a cost analysis per FAR 15.404-1(c) to support the determination of whether the proposed price is fair and reasonable.</p>

<p><br />52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-</p>
<p>(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-</p>
<p>(A) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(B) Have ( ) have not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and</p>
<p>(C) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision.; and</p>
<p>(D) Have [ballot], have not [ballot], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(ii) The Offeror has ( ) has not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.</p>
<p>(2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).</p>
<p>(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.</p>
<p>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.</p>
<p>(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p>252.201-7000 CONTRACTING OFFICER'S REPRESENTATIVE (DEC 1991)</p>
<p>(a) "Definition. Contracting officer's representative" means an individual designated in accordance with subsection 201.602-2 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and authorized in writing by the contracting officer to perform specific technical or administrative functions.</p>
<p>(b) If the Contracting Officer designates a contracting officer's representative (COR), the Contractor will receive a copy of the written designation. It will specify the extent of the COR's authority to act on behalf of the contracting officer. The COR is not authorized to make any commitments or changes that will affect price, quality, quantity, delivery, or any other term or condition of the contract.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>Addendum to 52.212-4 CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS -- COMMERCIAL ITEMS</p>
<p>Insurance: Federal Law and regulation require Government contractors to possess appropriate insurance coverage for their employees. The Government reserves the right to request evidence of appropriate insurance, including Longshoreman's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA) coverage required to perform work on or near ships.

All policies shall contain an endorsement stating that any cancellation or material change in the coverage adversely affecting the Government's interest shall not be effective unless the Contractor provides written notice of the same to the Contracting Officer.</p>

Price" and "Extended Price", respectively.&nbsp; Does this mean NIH anticipates to have 6 of each type of class per month so 72 per year or 6 per year and the value that goes on the monthly colum is the cost per course offering?<br /><br />&nbsp;- The "Mthly.

THE FOLLOWING PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES ARE APPLICABLE AND ARE HEREBY INCORPORATED INTO THE SOLICITATION BY REFERENCE AND BY FULL TEXT (Listed Below).

THE FULL TEXT OF THE CLAUSES/PROVISIONS FROM THE FAR AND DFARS CAN BE ACCESSED VIA THE INTERNET USING THE FOLLOWING WEB-SITE ADDRESS: www.arnet.gov or http://farsite.hill.af.mil

It is the responsibility of the Quoting Contractor(s) to obtain copies of the necessary provisions and or clauses that are required as a part of this solicitation.
  Required clauses/provisions that are not submitted may render a contractor(s) quote(s) to not be accepted by the Government. 

FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items

NOTE: This provision must be reviewed completely. It contains the guidelines for submission of your quotation. In addition, Quoting Contractors are instructed to complete and submit the attached past performance survey (found on the NECO site) with submitted quotes prior to the closing date of this notice specified herein.   

FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation of Commercial Items; 

(a)  The Government plans to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Quoting Contractor whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.
  The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes.  

     (i)  CAPABILITY TO PERFORM
    (ii)  PAST PERFORMANCE
    (iii)  PRICE

(b)  Only those Quoting Contractors which are determined by the contracting officer to be technically capable of performing under Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii) and (iii).  In the second step of evaluating quotes determined under Factor (i) to be technically acceptable, Factor (ii), PAST PERFORMANCE, is as important as Factor (iii), PRICE.  

At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate quotes and award a purchase order without discussions with Quoting Contractors.  Each initial quote should, therefore contain the Quoting Contractors best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.
   

(c)  By submitting a signed quote under this solicitation, Contractor asserts that it is technically capable of performing the specification/ statement of work and all aspects of this contract.  The contracting officer will validate contractors technical capability to perform by verifying that the contractor that supplied a quote has financial resources, organization and facilities required to perform the contract.  TECHNICAL CAPABILITY TO PERFORM represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.  Under this factor, contractors will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to be determined technically acceptable under this factor will render the quote to be unacceptable and to not be considered for award.
  

(d)  Quoting Contractors PAST PERFORMANCE information will be used to make a determination of whether the contractor supplying a quote has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Contractors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years with submitted quotes. 

PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation (posted on the NECO site).  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources that may have relevant information. 

A quoting Contractor which lacks relevant past performance history will receive a NEUTRAL rating for this factor.
  Any Quoting Contractor which has no relevant past performance history, while rated NEUTRAL, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the other quotes received.

The Contracting Officer will evaluate Quoting Contractors PAST PERFORMANCE as follows:

NEUTRAL:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.  Quoting Contractor has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives demerit for this factor.

OUTSTANDING:   No risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the quoting Contractor's past performance.

SATISFACTORY:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the Quoting Contractor's past performance.

MARGINAL:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the Quoting Contractor's past performance.


A written notice of award otherwise furnished to the successful Quoting Contractor within the time for acceptance specified in the quote, shall result in a purchase order without further action by either party.
  Before the quote's specified expiration time, the Government may place a purchase order, whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

(End of provision)

The Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Network Contracting Office (NCO) 5, will solicit proposals under Solicitation No. VA245-12-R-0019 for the following:
Rural Case Management Outreach for Homeless Veterans and those at risk of Homelessness
Background Information
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has a goal of ending homelessness among Veterans by 2015.  This goal is supported through the placement of Veterans Health Administration (VHA) homelessness services in rural areas, where there is identified community support for this population.  Rural or out-of-state homeless Veterans have difficulty or refuse to lease their state to seek services from VA Medical Center (VAMC) Homeless Programs.  Returning Veterans and Veterans struggling due to the economy may not have the knowledge or resources to prevent homelessness.  A VA homelessness program based in rural communities is needed to outreach, engage, case manage, refer, and educate homeless Veterans and Veterans at-risk of becoming homeless.  Homelessness services are needed in rural areas, where it is difficult for homeless Veterans to travel to medical centers for assessment.  Challenges with rural transportation and assessment time may leave Veterans stranded overnight away from services in their communities.  This overnight absence may also impact current housing in a community shelter or create other social support issues, which in turn may create additional barriers to ending homelessness.
Scope and Task Summary
This 12-month contract proposes to continue the establishment of a homelessness services program for rural communities in Pocomoke City, MD; Cambridge, MD; Charlotte Hall, MD; and Stephens City, VA by providing homelessness  evaluation and coordination with Community-Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) in these areas. Four Licensed Masters of Social Work (MSWs) and/or Licensed Mental Health Counselors (LMHCs) will act as contracted case managers, working out of the CBOCs or appropriate location within the rural community to enhance Veteran participation and to conduct immediate consultations.  When Veterans seek assistance or are referred, the case manager and CBOC staff will begin the process of enrollment and coordinate primary care and mental health assessment, as appropriate.  Furthermore, the case manager will work with the Veterans to coordinate appropriate VA services and referrals.
In addition to providing case management and identification and referral to needed resources, the case managers will also foster partnerships and collaboration among local health and mental health agencies and resources, establish standard operating procedures for working with the target population, develop service agreements with community resources, and advertise Veteran homelessness prevention services.

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because the procurement is awarded to a sole source under the Test Program for Certain Commercial Items (FAR 13.5). See posted J&A for further information.<br><br>PRIORITY 3 ACQUISITION <br>MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD<br>FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br>BELOW THE SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION THRESHOLD<br><br><br>1. Contracting Agency: Southern Regional Contracting Office - West, Brooke Army Medical Center (BAMC), Fort Sam Houston, TX 78234<br><br>2. Description of Action: Urgent procurement of Abiomed Blood Pumps.<br><br>3. Description of Products/Services:  The Abiomed Blood Pumps are life saving devices that are surgically implanted when an open heart patient is unable to be weaned from the heart-lung machine. <br><br>4. Authority Cited: <br>-Pursuant to FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1), Soliciting competition.  For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officer may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g. urgency).<br><br>-Pursuant to FAR Part 5.202(a)(2), Exceptions. The unusual and compelling requirement will not be advertised.<br><br>-Pursuant to FAR Part 13.106(c)(1), Soliciting competition.  Price and availability will be obtained telephonically.<br><br>5. Reason for Cited Authority: The above statutory authority is cited because this is a true, urgent request that has been verified by Janet Rindorf on 27Mar12.  The Abiomed Blood Pumps must be available and always on hand because the physician does not know a head of time if weaning will be successful.  The current stock is set to expire on 31Mar12 and policy dictates the hospital always have the pumps available.  If the physician does not have the Abiomed Blood Pumps available, it could be detrimental to the patient's life as well as the hospital's overall medical mission. <br><br>6. Contracting Officer Certification:  I certify this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.<br><br><br>Signature:  // Orginal Signature//             		Date: 03/28/2012<br>Name:        Melissa Oliva				<br>Title:       Contracting Officer		<br>

<DESC>The Forest Service intends to purchase and install up to 20 Operational Loads Monitoring Systems (OLMS) on Government-owned aircraft involved in aerial firefighting. This equipment monitors and determines operational loads experienced within the low level fire suppression environment. The OLMS is comprised of all equipment required for recording to acquire, record, and transmit required parameters experienced by a firefighting aircraft during flight operations. Currently, the Forest Service has 31 systems which were purchased from Appareo Systems under a previous contract. These systems were certified and had been installed by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Field Approval or Supplemental Type Certificates (STC) in aircraft. <br /><br />These systems collect detailed flight data which is written to a Secure Digital (SD) card in the Appareo manufactured GAU 2000. The GAU 2000 is DO-160 certified and has been installed by FAA Field Approval or supplemental type certificate (STC) in aircraft. This approval is mandatory for all equipment installed on Forest Service owned or contracted aircraft. <br /><br />The operation of this system is as follows: After a mission has been flown and the aircraft lands, the SD card is removed from the GAU 2000 and processed by an Appareo developed file transfer program. This program performs initial quality checks of the flight data and sends it to the Appareo data processing server via the internet. The server then parses the data, performs additional quality assurance of the data and creates a gps file for the Appareo Alerts application and a file in the .s3t format is posted to the Forest Service library database hosted by nCode International. The data supplied through this chain has to maintain quality and represent the flight that was flown. This data is used by the Forest Service through an interagency agreement with the FAA and their center for excellence at Wichita State University (WSU). WSU has created a software application to process the data collected from the Appareo OLMS. Currently, the library holds over 15,000 flight hours. Once processed, WSU creates an Operational Loads report for the specific special mission profile (Large Air tanker, Smokejumper, Lead plane, etc.) which is then published by the FAA through the grant funded by the Forest Service. Once published, these reports document the aerodynamic loads experienced by firefighting aircraft. These reports can then be used to formulate appropriate maintenance and inspection programs for these aircraft ensuring their safe operation and averting catastrophic structural failures. <br /><br />Due to the proprietary nature of the equipment and software developed and installed by Appareo Systems, they are the only source able to service and maintain these systems. Appareo's continued support of these systems and the data collected is critical to assuring that the data gathered is valid. Replacing the existing OLMS with a system from a different manufacturer would invalidate the 15,000 hours of flight data previously collected and would not guarantee that future data would correlate to the previously collected data. <br />
