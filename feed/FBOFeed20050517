<DESC>LOUIS STOKES CLEVELAND DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS MEDICAL CENTER ENHANCED-USE DEVELOPMENT  REAL ESTATE OPPORTUNITY BRECKSVILLE, OH INDUSTRY FORUM An Industry Forum will be provided for potential offerors on Wednesday, May 18, 2005.  The Industry Forum will be held to provide the development community with more information on this upcoming solicitation.  Please go to www.bbpa.com/vamccleveland to register for more information, including an agenda and directions.  Participation in a tour of the Brecksville campus and in the Industry Forum require an RSVP by Tuesday, May 17th, at 12 pm CT.  Attendees will be limited to a team of three participants.  The Brecksville campus tour will be offered at 10 am.  The Industry Forum will be held at the Wade Park campus at 2 pm.   PROJECT SUMMARY The VA has identified a 100-acre site, which is VAMC Cleveland’s entire Brecksville campus, for redevelopment.  Using an Enhanced-Use development process, the Department is seeking development entities with the qualifications and experience necessary to assist VA in its on-going efforts to improve veteran services, reduce costs, and generate new sources of revenues.  The selected private, public, and/or not-for-profit developer(s) will ground lease the entire Brecksville site from the VA in exchange for providing fair market value consideration for the ground lease.  The fair market value consideration will be to provide all or part of the following service needs of the VA at or within operational proximity to the Wade Park campus: •Domiciliary care services containing 122 beds •Administrative office space for approximately 65,000 net usable square feet (plus the opportunity for additional space for other federal and non-federal tenants estimated at 80,000 net usable square feet) •Parking services for 2,000 cars To these ends, the Department sees these private, public, and/or not-for-profit sector opportunities as compatible with the VAMC Cleveland campus mission and as an extension of VAMC Cleveland campus business objectives.   The Department believes there is a sizeable opportunity for VAMC Cleveland and a private, public, and/or not-for-profit sector developer/property manager to work together to receive significant benefits.  Specifically, the private, public, and/or not-for-profit sector has the opportunity to receive a market rate return from development activities, leasing of rentable square footage, and continuing property management of real estate assets at the Brecksville site in exchange for services to VAMC Cleveland at Wade Park.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) plans to negotiate and award a contract on a sole-source basis with the Health Effects Institute (HEI) in accordance with FAR 6.302.  The objective of this procurement is to determine before widespread commercial deployment whether or not the new (2007 and 2010 EPA Emissions Standards compliant) low emissions of NOx and Particulate Matter (PM) Heavy Duty diesel engines may generate unanticipated toxic emissions which could adversely affect the environment and human health.  HEI brings together a unique and innovative consortium of government, industry and nonprofit organizations who will conduct the ACES project.  HEI is the only entity capable of performing this study because of the unique and innovative collaboration of government, industry and non-profit organizations it brings together.  This unique collaboration of organizations provides the combined necessary expertise and required level of funding to successfully complete the project.  The HEI collaborative expertise and capabilities include:  expertise in the design of biological (animal, cell, bacteria) exposure experiments to test health related hypotheses and ensure the results are statistically valid; expertise in the generation, collection and chemical characterization of vehicle emissions samples; and expertise in engine, fuels and exhaust aftertreatment technologies.  In addition, the HEI collaboration provides regulatory agency, and national and public interest sector perspectives with respect to the ACES project.

<SUBJECT>16 -- Install a Doppler Radar System in Gulfstream IV Aircraft
<SOLNBR>EA133M-05-RP-1109
<RESPDATE>050205
<CONTACT>Linda Stein, Contract Specialist, Phone 757-441-6573, Fax 757-441-3786, Email Linda.C.Stein@noaa.gov - Margaret Rankin, Contracting Officer, Phone 757-441-6562, Fax 757-441-3786, Email margaret.a.rankin@noaa.gov
<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) at MacDill Air Force Base (AFB), FL, has a requirement for a tail-mounted scanning dual-beam X-band research radar system to be used on the NOAA Gulfstream G-IVSP aircraft. NOAA presently anticipates award of a fixed price contract no later than September 2005.  The contract will have a design phase with Preliminary and Critical Design Reviews, followed by a construction and installation phase.  The contract may also require the contractor to use earned value measurement and cost performance monitoring (EVM/CPM).

The Doppler radar system will be used to obtain detailed wind field information for initialization of the National Weather Service (NWS) Hurricane Weather and Research Forecast (HWRF) model.  The Doppler weather radar system shall have the following characteristics:  (1) reflectivity accuracy of ~1dBZ; (2) a radial velocity accuracy of ~1m/s; (3) a vertical resolution of 1 km; (4) a maximum horizontal unambiguous range of at least 50 km; (5) a maximum  rotational rate of at least 10 rpm (60 degrees/sec) to provide target horizontal (along-track) data spacing resolution of no more than 1.5km; (6) a maximum sampled gate length of 150 m; and (7) a total space displacement that permits it to fit within a new tail radome approximately 39 inches in diameter.  The Doppler radar system will interface with a data path and quality control system currently under development by NOAA.  In addition, a Government-provided stepped frequency microwave radiometer (SFMR) must be incorporated into the new tail radome enclosure.  The aircraft is FAA certified and maintains a valid airworthiness certificate.  The installation of the tail radar unit will involve physical modification of the aircraft that will affect its flight characteristics and weight balance.  Such modifications must be accomplished in conformance with the original equipment manufacture’s flight envelope specifications and must comply with FAA certification requirements for the specific aircraft type and mode of operation.  The modified G-IV aircraft is required to comply with Federal Aviation Administration regulations in the Code Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 14, Part 25, 14 CFR Part 36 and 14 CFR Part 91.  The original equipment manufacturer has retained most rights in data for the aircraft.  Performance of this work must be accomplished so as to have as little impact as possible on availability of the G-IV aircraft to perform mandated hurricane, winter storm and other meteorological reconnaissance and research.  Windows of availability of the aircraft for modification and testing exist for 2-3 months in the late Spring and 1-2 months in late Fall of each year.  Delivery of the complete tail radar installation is required not later than July 2007.  This requirement will provide for data collection and characterization by NOAA during the 2007 hurricane season, with full system certification and operational use in the 2008 hurricane season.  NOAA anticipates establishment of a ground mockup system at AOC in order to facilitate Doppler radar system testing and integration with the SFMR and data collection systems.  

In order to ensure that small businesses have a fair opportunity to participate in this acquisition, NOAA will use the Small Business Cascading Evaluation Preference Process.  This cascading set-aside preference provision is included in this Request for Proposals to notify large businesses that, if a sufficient number of eligible small businesses submit highly qualified offers; large businesses may not be considered for award.  The Government reserves the right to make either a full set-aside award or a partial set-aside award depending on the number and acceptability of responses received from small businesses in the evaluation.  The Department of Commerce (DOC) requires that all contractors doing business with Government be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).  Award cannot be made to a company not registered in CCR.  For additional information and to register in CCR, please access the following web site:  www.ccr.gov.  In order to register, all offerors must have a Dun and Bradstreet (D&B) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) identifier.  A DUNS number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun & Bradstreet on-line at www.dnb.com/product/eupdate, or by phone at (800) 333-0505.  The solicitation, notice and all amendments will be posted and available for viewing and downloading on the Government Electronic Posting System (FedBizOpps) site at www.fedbizzzopps.gov. No paper copies will be issued.  No telephone, facsimile or written requests will be accepted.

<DESC>Plan no. EVD050005.  The Office of Vocational and Adult Education (OVAE) has a need for a contractor to support the development of a three-year national technology initiative that would expand the capability of adult education programs to individualize learning, equip teachers with new instructional tools, expand access to resources, and engage learners in new ways.  The initiative is called Strengthening Programs through Technology.

Despite the efforts of the current programs, the federally funded adult education program is providing services to less than 10% of the projected number of eligible adults.  The new technology initiative, supported with FY 2004 funding, will build on previous investments and provide a range of services to states, local programs, and adult learners in the areas of distance learning, professional preparation, resource evaluation, and the support of partnerships among states with similar needs.  The project will also closely coordinate and connect resources with a variety of public and private initiatives to avoid duplication of efforts and create wider access to adult literacy services using on-line technology.  The project will also ensure that activities are coordinated with the Literacy Information and Communication System (LINCS)  and National Institute for Literacy (NIFL).

Deliverables:  Attached is the Draft Statement of Work, with details on deliverables and tasks.  Please submit any questions regarding it to DeShonjla A. Blount, Deshonjla.Blount@ed.gov, and we will address the public's concerns in the Final Statement of Work.  Anticipated release date: May 30, 2005.

<CONTACT>Heather Morvant, Contract Specialist, Phone 571-227-1592, Email heather.morvant@dhs.gov
<DESC>The Transportation Security Administration intends to award a contract on a single-source basis to BearingPoint of McLean, VA via their GSA MOBIS schedule contract.  

The purpose of the contract award is to provide support services to the Screening Partnership Program (SPP) Program Management Office (PMO) at a critical time in the maturity of the program.  To meet ATSA requirements, TSA is developing the SPP to capitalize on the private sector’s innovation and flexibility while maintaining federal security standards. The SPP PMO has designed the program based on operational lessons-learned with the private pilot PP5 program, created by ATSA (49 U.S.C. 44919), as well as independent evaluation studies of PP5 airport operations.  To support the initial congressionally mandated private pilot program, TSA issued a competitively awarded Task Order to Bearing Point.  

Currently TSA is in the critical phase of identifying qualified vendors to bid on airport-unique Task Orders and creating the infrastructure to implement the SPP Program.  Due to unpredictability in airport operator demand, the short-term but resource-intensive requirements of converting an airport from federal to private operations, and the rapid growth in PMO responsibilities to manage the finances, contracts, assessments, policies, and ATSA compliance of each privatized airport, the PMO seeks to obtain contractor support to continue developing the SPP program.  The tasks require experience and knowledge of the program and TSA’s Aviation Operations, airport operating environment, TSA’s performance management systems and performance management approach.  The tasks will need to be completed in a short timeframe.  

BearingPoint has unique knowledge and subject matter expertise that is required to support the SPP management team as it begins to transition federal screening operations to private contractors beginning the 3rd quarter 2005.  BearingPoint has shown past performance, experience and expertise in several areas that are key to the SPP’s success, including:  initial screener federalization (SASR rollout), performance measurement, federal acquisitions, privatization of government functions, change management, program and project management, financial analysis, communications/stakeholder management, and strategic planning. 

During the past performance periods BearingPoint personnel have provided testimony before the US House of Representatives and US Senate for this important program.  They have briefed six congressional committees on the findings of their evaluation.  BearingPoint personnel have provided detailed information to assist the GAO in two studies of the program. BearingPoint's detailed statistical study of the PP5 airports’ security screening operations serves as the benchmark for the evaluation of security screening performance of both federal and private contract screening operations.  

In addition, BearingPoint has provided valuable counsel and support regarding the development of the SPP in terms of future program structure, policymaking, transition planning, and acquisition strategy.  The high visibility, numerous news articles, potential risk, aggressive time constraints, and complexity involved with transitioning federal screening operations to private contractors position BearingPoint as the only contractor capable of achieving success in the required time frame.  

The proposed contract award is a bridge contract covering a period of two months to allow for processing of a competitive award.  It is envisioned that the follow-on effort would be set-aside for small business.

Title:  Replacement of PAMS subsystem of the GUARDRAIL Common Sensor System CECOM/GUARDRAIL weapon system teams plans to enter into an agreement for replacement of the Programmable Adaptable Modules (PAM) subsystem that is used on the GUARDRAIL Common Sensor System.  The ultimate goal of this market research would be a contract fo r development of a replacement for this system.  The current subsystem has numerous vanishing vendor issues and a high sustainment cost.  The contract would also provide for follow on to procure the replacement and for a limited sustainment contract.  The sustainment of this new system should be designed for contractor sustainment in the short term with a plan to transition support to an organic source of repair.  Anyone interested in providing a response should outline their experience with the current tec hnology and have some suggested plan for replacement.  Note that responses that are general in nature and show only your knowledge of general electronic research will not be considered a valid response.  Responses must address an approach to solving this s pecific sustainment issue. The equipments that is being considered in this market research are as follows: Limited drawings are available on request for review by potential respondents.    Audio Management System PAM and Special Signals PAM 1.	Audio Management System (AMS) Processor a.	Nomenclature: CP-2171/TSQ-176, NSN 5895-01-365-8783 b.	Purpose: The AMS processor CP-2171/TSQ-176 provides audio recording, playback, and archiving capabilities for the Information Processing Center (IPF), AN/TSQ-176 subsystem, which is a tactical intercept and emitter location system with facilities for re porting messages to tactical commanders in the field. The primary purpose of the AMS processor is to record and play back intercept audio, as well as to provide capabilities that support the recording of voice annotations, and the association of these anno tations and any technical data obtained, with the audio intercepts. The AMS processor also provides data base capabilities that allow the display and selection of audio subsets as well as associated data for analysis and management purposes. c.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The base quantity is expected to be 10,000 restraints (2,500 kits for 4-door HMMWV vehicles).

The contract will have one  base line item for the Design of the Tail Doppler Radar System (Phase I) and option line items to include  the construction, integration and system testing (Phase II), one G-IV Ground Doppler Radar System,  engineering change orders, spares, repair parts and ground support equipment.
Anticipated release date of solicitation is changed from on or about April 1, 2005 to on or about April 21, 2005. 






The Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) at MacDill Air Force Base (AFB), FL, has a requirement for a tail-mounted scanning dual-beam X-band research radar system to be used on the NOAA Gulfstream G-IVSP aircraft. NOAA presently anticipates award of a fixed price contract no later than September 2005.  The contract will have a design phase with Preliminary and Critical Design Reviews, followed by a construction and installation phase.  The contract may also require the contractor to use earned value measurement and cost performance monitoring (EVM/CPM).

The Doppler radar system will be used to obtain detailed wind field information for initialization of the National Weather Service (NWS) Hurricane Weather and Research Forecast (HWRF) model.  The Doppler weather radar system shall have the following characteristics:  (1) reflectivity accuracy of ~1dBZ; (2) a radial velocity accuracy of ~1m/s; (3) a vertical resolution of 1 km; (4) a maximum horizontal unambiguous range of at least 50 km; (5) a maximum  rotational rate of at least 10 rpm (60 degrees/sec) to provide target horizontal (along-track) data spacing resolution of no more than 1.5km; (6) a maximum sampled gate length of 150 m; and (7) a total space displacement that permits it to fit within a new tail radome approximately 39 inches in diameter.  The Doppler radar system will interface with a data path and quality control system currently under development by NOAA.  In addition, a Government-provided stepped frequency microwave radiometer (SFMR) must be incorporated into the new tail radome enclosure.  The aircraft is FAA certified and maintains a valid airworthiness certificate.  The installation of the tail radar unit will involve physical modification of the aircraft that will affect its flight characteristics and weight balance.  Such modifications must be accomplished in conformance with the original equipment manufacture’s flight envelope specifications and must comply with FAA certification requirements for the specific aircraft type and mode of operation.  The modified G-IV aircraft is required to comply with Federal Aviation Administration regulations in the Code Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 14, Part 25, 14 CFR Part 36 and 14 CFR Part 91.  The original equipment manufacturer has retained most rights in data for the aircraft.  Performance of this work must be accomplished so as to have as little impact as possible on availability of the G-IV aircraft to perform mandated hurricane, winter storm and other meteorological reconnaissance and research.  Windows of availability of the aircraft for modification and testing exist for 2-3 months in the late Spring and 1-2 months in late Fall of each year.  Delivery of the complete tail radar installation is required not later than July 2007.  This requirement will provide for data collection and characterization by NOAA during the 2007 hurricane season, with full system certification and operational use in the 2008 hurricane season.  NOAA anticipates establishment of a ground mockup system at AOC in order to facilitate Doppler radar system testing and integration with the SFMR and data collection systems.

<CONTACT>Chinh P Le Contracting Officer 3039697235     Chinh_P_Le@nbc.gov;
<DESC>1.  Submitted Question:  Has the following section been removed?  Supplementary Written Information.  In general, Supplementary Written Information   shall include resumes, a summary of agreements with consultants and subcontractors, invoice and time card examples, and a summary of other corporate policies and procedures including recruitment, training, leave, benefits, retirement, insurance, employee assistance program, education allowance, mass transit subsidy, alternate work schedules, and travel policies.  Offerors are advised that price information should be separate from the technical and management proposal. Response:  Yes. 2.  Submitted Question:  Is the following "reps and certs" section part of the 30 pages?  Should it be completed and turned in with the proposal? Response:  "Reps and certs are separate from the Technical Proposal," and should be submitted with the proposal (unless submitted via ORCA). 3.  Submitted Question:  Since resumes are now "sample" resumes, are you looking for "sample" resumes to meet the first task? or sample resumes that could be used on future tasks? Response:  We have not requested samples for tasks. 4.  Submitted Question: Does section D.  SPECIFIC TASKS represent the first task order's work?  Is this what you would like priced? Response: Not necessarily, this is an overall summary of tasks. 5.  Submitted Question: Do you want on-site and off-site pricing, or should we assume all work will be performed at the NBC with the NBC's equipment? Response:  On-site pricing using NBC's equipment. 6.  Submitted Question: Is the resume to be double spaced also? Response:  Yes. 7.  Submitted Question:  Resume:  Are you looking for just the PM's resume?  Considering this is a non-personal services IDIQ contract, it makes sense not to ask for many resumes at this point. Response:  "Sample" resumes may be submitted for all categories at the offeror's discretion. 8.  Submitted Question:  How many IDIQ awards are anticipated?  Response:  1 9.  Submitted Question:  Is the resume that is required just an example resume, or must it be a resume that we will actually have the person who up on-site?  How long will the first task be for?  Response:  Yes.  First task is from date of award through September 30, 2005.  10.  Submitted Question:  Do we submit proposals electronically or in hard copy?  Response:  Hard copy. 11.  Submitted Question:  Is the resume to be double spaced like the rest of the proposal?  Response:  See question 6. 12.  Submitted Question:  Do you want on-site management?  Response:  We are not dictating how the contractor manages its staff, but is solely responsible for its staff on site. 13.  Submitted Question:  Shouldn't section 4. evaluation factors be revised to better match the current SOW?  Response:  No. 14.  Submitted Question:  Is this an SCA contract?  SCA is mentioned.  Response:  SCA was not applicable since these are professional positions.  This was removed with Amendment 0004. 15.  Submitted Question:  Oral presentations are mentioned.  When will these occur?  Should our oral presentation materials be submitted with out technical proposal?   Response:  The section about oral presentations has been deleted. 16.  Submitted Question:  Does the 30 page limit include a table of contents page Response:   Yes.  A table of contents is not necessary.  17. Submitted Question 	where can I find the following documents:       NIST SP 800-26		NIST SP 800-53	NIST SP 800-34 Response:  www.nist.gov 18. Submitted Question Also - Please consider removing the requirement for "sample" resumes. Companies, including ours, will be spending the next 2 weeks developing the perfect resumes that will be "samples" and will not represent the staff we would be able to place at NBC.   It will all boil down to who can write the best resume(s) and tweak them so they sound great.  Everyone has access to monster.com and can find many resumes. Also it appears you now only want 1 sample resume? Response:  You may provide either actual or sample resumes for potential contractor personnel.  Resume was a typo and should have been plural.  Correction will be on Amendment 0005. 19. Submitted Question:  The rates you are requesting - are these to be for full time employees? Response:  These are fully burdened hourly rates. 20. Submitted Question:  Rates will vary for either part-time or short-term projects.  Obviously employing someone for 2 weeks will be very expensive on an hourly basis compared to hiring someone for 2 years. We suggest you request company multipliers (example: x1.75) that include everything instead of asking for rates of unknown labor categories.  This will allow an eveb comparison of all companies and will also allow youth see how competitive a company can be. Response:  We are requesting fixed unit prices.  Each set of requirements will be defined by each task order. 21. Submitted Question:  Section J: where is Clause "DOI Contractor Personnel Security & Suitability Requirements-NBC Sept 2004?  It refers to the background investigation contractor personnel will have to obtain (paid by DOI).  Please provide us information so we may review this clause.  We attempted to review these by searching on DOI.gov but found no such clause Response:  Clause will be added in Amendment 0005. 22.  Submitted Question:  Section J: Contractor will perform an annual self assessment in accordance with NIST SP800-26 on all MAs, GSSs and outsourced applications in production.  What are MAs and GSSs? Response:  MA - Major Applications, GSS - General Support Systems 23.  Submitted Question:  Section F refers to Place of Performance as being NBC's Denver office or one of many NBC offices or client sites.  If all work will be performed within NBC or client offices, why is the following required of the contractor?  The solicitation never mentions these systems to be accessed from the vendor's facilities   Self Assessment NIST SP800-26 on all MAs & GSSs? Vulnerability Analysis Systems scanned monthly with a tool compatible with the software in use by the OCIO.   What software tool is the OCIO using for DOI vulnerability analysis? Penetration Testing: Of all high risk systems accessible from the internet Security Controls: Contractors are to comply with NIST SP800-53 or FIPS 200.  Solicitations are to include the complete publication or a reference to it. Contingency Plan:  Contractors are to submit a plan in accordance with NIST SP800-34 or a reference to it Response:  These are part of the IT Security requirements as directed by DOI memo from Hord Tipton, 8/04 24.  Submitted Question:  Section K: Contractor Responsibilities.  SOW #2 (NBCR05021/0002) had a list of reports to be submitted on the 5th workday of each month.  The new solicitation has omitted the list of reports under Section K, 10.  Why is this? Response:  We only need one QA report a month. 25.  Submitted Question:  What are the new evaluation criteria referred to in Part L, (c), (2)? Response:  This remains unchanged from original solicitation. 26.  Submitted Question:  How many individual contractors are onsite at NBC representing the incumbent?  What labor categories are they assigned to? Response:  Currently there are 5 full-time and 2 part-time staff.  Categories are 2 IT Specialists, 3 Software Engineers, 2 full time, and 1 part time, respectively; 2 Sr. Systems Analysts, 1 full time and 1 part time. 27.  Submitted Question:  Why did NBC decide to remove the six labor categories represented in SOW 1 and SOW 2?  It appears that it is now up to the respondents to propose labor categories in SOW 3. Response:  This is up to the contractor to propose labor categories to fulfill the requirements of each Task Order. 28.  Submitted Question:  Will NBC be posting all questions and responses to FBO/IDEAS-EC? Response:  Yes.  29.  Submitted Question:  Please define what you mean by "text shall be double spaced" on page 12 of Amendment 4?  This seems like it would limit the response to 15 pages as opposed to 30 pages. Response:  Double-spaced means double-spaced. Either way, the technical proposals are to be no more than 30 pages long. 30.  Submitted Question:  Amendment 4 does not include information on preparing Supplemental Information as specified in Amendment 2--are we to assume that Supplemental Information is no longer required as part of the Technical and Management Proposal?  Response:  Supplemental Information part was removed as it was replaced by separate pricing and technical management proposal instructions.   31.  Submitted Question:  Is it the intention of the NBC to still use the evaluation criteria established in the original solicitation on page 13? Response:  Yes. 32.  Submitted Question:  How will past performance be evaluated? Response:  Reference checks as well as other methods as determined by technical and acquisition personnel will be used.   33.  Submitted Question:  What specific information are you looking for in regards to subcontracting plans and agreements? Response:  Because this is an 8(a) set aside, Subcontracts/formal subcontracting plans are not required, however the prime must perform at least 51% of the work.   34.  Submitted Question Are past performances limited to a certain period of time (i.e. within 5 years)? Response:  No. 35.  Submitted Question:  Are there any limitations to sub-contracting?  (i.e. are offerers restricted to teaming with only other 8(a) s or small businesses) Response:  See response to question 33. 36.  Submitted Question:  On page 4 of amendment 4, the specific task states that the contractor will respond to NBC staff inquiries, as required, for the following custom software applications and interfaces--would this be in the form of Help Desk support for end users? Response:  Either help-desk calls, meetings or face-to-face. 37.  Submitted Question:  SOW, Page 2.  The Interface Development section refers to a completed project.  The three interfaces to which the section refers were developed and delivered to USGS several years ago.  Interface maintenance is provided by USGS.  Was this requirement included in error?   Response:  This was only a sample. 38. Submitted Question:  SOW, Page 3.  The Web Application Development section includes the same description included under Interface Development on page 2.  Is this an error?   Response:  Yes.  The Web Application Development section was been removed. 39.  Submitted Question:  SOW, Page 3.  The Oracle Federal Financial System Support, Technical Writing, and Custom Software Maintenance and Support sections do not include a projected level of effort (i.e. number of clients, users, applications, etc.).  Is it the NBC's expectation that cost proposals will contain base hourly rates only for proposed labor categories?  Response:  Yes, but fully burdened. 40.  Submitted Question:  There appears to be a discrepancy between the SOW and the responses to Questions No. 18 and 33.  The SOW states that the 30 page limit on the Technical and Management Proposal includes resumes, implying that resumes are a requirement of the proposal.  The response to Question No. 18 seems to indicate that resumes are required and may be limited to two pages each.  The response to Question No. 33 states that sample resumes are acceptable; however, it gives no indication if they are required and if they count against the page limit.  Normally, resumes are exempt from the page limit to permit a fair comparison among proposals that include different resource levels.  Please clarify (1) if we are required to propose specific staff and include their resumes for this solicitation (2) if sample resumes are an acceptable substitute for proposing specific staff at this time (3) if actual or samples resumes are subject to a 2 page limit and (4) if either actual or sample resumes count against the 30 page limit.   Response:  (1) Specific staff resumes are preferred, (2) Yes, (3) Yes, and (4) All resumes, either real or samples, count against the 30 page limit. 41.  Submitted Question:  SOW, Page 12.  Do examples of relevant past performance count against the 30 page limit?   Response:  Yes. 42.  Submitted Question:  SOW, Page2 and 5 & Question Responses There appears to be discrepancies among the SOW and the responses to Questions No. 2, 5, 43, and 58 regarding which financial systems are to be supported.    ¢	Question No. 2 specifies Oracle and Momentum ¢	Question No. 5 specifies Oracle, Momentum, and FFS ¢	Questions No. 43 and 58 specify Oracle The SOW (Page 5) requires that the contractor provide staff with expertise in Oracle Federal Financials, Momentum, and the Federal Financial System.  It appears that the NBC's requirement would include support for Momentum, Oracle Federal Financials, and FFS.  Please confirm if this is the case.     Response:  We need support for Oracle, FFS, and Momentum. 43.  Submitted Question:  M. PRICE SCHEDULE INSTRUCTIONS: a. Offers shall provide a list of all skill categories that the offeror determines are needed in performance of the Statement of Work. .....There is no limit on number of skill categories.  However, Offerors should not include categories that are not specific to the requirement." You don't want a resume for every category we price do you?  To give NBC flexibility in the future, we plan on offering multiple levels (senior, intermediate, junior) of multiple labor categories. Response:  Sample resumes for all potential categories are acceptable.  What we do not want are irrelevant categories (i.e. secretary, accountant and, etc.) 44.  Submitted Question:  As new tasks are requested in the future, under this IDIQ contract, will we have the opportunity to add new labor categories at that time?  Or are we locked into the list of labor categories we give you now? Response:  We are limited to the scope of the contract and SBA's limitations.  45.  Submitted Question:  "I Technical and Management Proposal Orig + 4 Copies shall be no more then 30 pages including Resume".  What resume (singular) are you looking for?  Our Project Manager's resume? Response:  See question 18.  Actual or "sample" resumes apply to for all current or future positions. 46.  Submitted Question: "Clin		 Skill Category		 Unit		 Rate" Cost tables do not currently include Estimated Quantity.  Was this an error? Response:  No.  47.  Submitted Question:  We assume you would like Units to be in hours.  Is this correct?   Response:  Yes, unit hours are acceptable.  48.  Submitted Question:  SPECIFIC TASKS  The contractor shall provide staff to fulfill the following tasks/duties: Question - Does section D, Specific Tasks represent the contents of the first anticipated task order?   Response:  No, this was a general list for this SOW. 49. Submitted Question   Please consider the following question regarding the use of subcontractors.  It is understood that the winning offeror must provide 51% of the work done. Page 27, Section 13, paragraph 5, parts (b) states that the offeror subcontractor agree and acknowledge "that it will, for and on behalf of the SBA, fulfill and perform all of the requirements of the contract." and (c) states "The offeror/subcontractor agrees that it will not subcontract the performance of any of the requirements of this subcontract to any lower tier subcontractor without the prior written approval of the SBA and the cognizant Contracting Officer of the DOI-National Business Center." For (b) does this mean that the companies identified in the proposal must be able to perform all of the services described in the solicitation?   For (c) does this mean that if the companies identified in the proposal are unable to perform a requested service, for an unforeseen reason, that we may, with prior approval, provide the service through an additional, new subcontractor? Response:  See paragraph (a) under SECTION 8(A) AWARD.  This applies to SBA as the prime contractor.  The "subcontractor" referred to in this FAR clause is actually the vendor. 50. Submitted Question:  Please remove the requirement for resumes or allow free access to incumbent staff. Response:  Resumes are still required and we cannot authorize access to incumbent staff. 51. Submitted Question: Will NBC be providing ergonomically correct furniture to our on-site  staff?   Response:  Yes, but equipment is provided "as is". 52. Submitted Question:  We did not notice a requirement for English speaking.  Must our on-site  staff speak English?   Response:  Yes. 53. Submitted Question:  Are there any current or potential requirements for security clearances?   Response:  Yes.  This is required by DOI.  See amendment 0005. 54. Submitted Question:   Can employees telecommute?   Response:  This is up to the employer. 55. Submitted Question:  You ask for a description of our "management" but it appears you will be managing the projects?  What type of management are you looking for?   Response:  The government will manage the projects but the contractors will manage the contract work. 56.  Submitted Question:  Will staff placed on-site and work side-by-side with Government  employees? Response:  Performance is anticipated to be on site (See F.  PLACE OF PERFORMANCE) and workspace will be in areas designated to the contractor. 57.  Submitted Question   Since we do not have access to the incumbents and you are requesting  pricing for the incumbent positions, there is no way to accurately price them.  Can you compare corporate overheads/multipliers of the bidders instead of requesting generic labor category hourly pricing?   Response:  We are leaving the positions to the contractor's discretion and not the incumbent positions because different companies have different titles for positions, and can accomplish work in different ways.   58. Submitted Question:  What is the dress code policy of NBC?  Is there a casual Friday?   Response:  There is no dress code - business attire is recommended and should be specified by the contractor. On Fridays, business casual attire is allowed. 59.  Submitted Question:  What is the dating policy?  Can contractors date NBC employees?  Please define dating so there is no confusion later.  We have seen this become an issue as staff work together into the late hours on financial implementation projects.   Response:  Any fraternizing between contractor employee and government employees carries liabilities under stringent ethics statutes.  Prudent contractors should establish their own policies consistent with government statutes.  We recommend that you seek advice from your own legal counsel.

<DESC>Original Sources Sought Notice was posted on 5/11/05.  The purpose of this market survey is to identify to the Government potential sources interested in this procurement as either the prime contractor or a subcontractor.  The CECOM Software Engineer ing Center (SEC) is responsible for providing life cycle software support for Mission Critical Defense Systems (MCDSs).  The goals of the SEC are to: 1) establish/maintain Post Production Software Support (PPSS) for fielded systems, and 2) provide software  engineering support for systems both deployed and under upgrade. The contractor shall support the PPSS for both the AN/USC-28(V) Satellite Communications Set (SCS) and the AN/FSC-115, AN/GSC-63, and AN/TSC-133 Defense Satellite Communication System (DSCS)  Electronic Counter Counter Measures (ECCM) Communications Subsystem (DECS) and the Contingency DECS (CDECS), with the PPSS efforts fairly evenly split between the systems.  This contract will establish the requirements for level of effort base contract of  one year, with four one year options, for the acquisition of PPSS.  This PPSS support will consist primarily of the correction of software defects/deficiencies/errors, and the implementation of software refinements and enhancements to the operational and support software for these systems.   The AN/USC-28(V) Satellite Communications Set (SCS) operates over the DSCS Phase II & III satellites.  It is an Electronic Counter-Counter Measures (ECCM) communications system, which provides jam resistant, secure communications for departmental user netw orks by employing code division spread spectrum modulation techniques.  The system also accommodates command, control, and performance assessment of the ECCM network by the DSCS Operational Control System (DOCS) and Contingency DOCS (CDOCS) via orderwire o verhead communications channels.  Post Production Software Support (PPSS) will be on two AN/USC-28(V) baselines, the Ground Mitigated Version and the Airborne Mitigated Version. The SCS microprocessor was designed by the present contractor and is proprietary.  The SCS application software was developed by the present contractor, is an assembly language, and is proprietary.  The DECS consists of three subsystems; the AN/GSC-63 (DECS-RC), the AN/FSC-115 (DECS-CC), and the AN/TSC-133 (CDECS).  The DECS-RC & DECS-CC are subsystems of the DSCS Operations Control System (DOCS) and the CDECS is a subsystem of the Contingency DOCS (C DOCS).  The DECS-RC has a direct interface to the AN/USC-28(V) Satellite Communications Set to automate control of selected functions resulting in enhanced performance of the AN/USC-28(V) network which would not be feasible or possible under manual operati on.   Post Production Software Support (PPSS) will be performed on the DEC-RC, Merged DECS-CC/CDECS and possibly the DECS-CC software baselines.  The Government owns the software specifications/documentation. Contractors interested in providing this software support must indicate by replying in writing to the Procurement Coordinator, Valerie Bray, US Army CECOM, Software Engineering Center Contracts Office, Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703, telephone (732) 532-6499  fa x no. 732-532-4963 or mailto:valerie.bray@mail1.monmouth.army.mil . The Army does not anticipate holding interchange meetings with potential offerors.  NOTE:  This is a request for information only and all information received will be for planning purposes  only.  The CECOM Acquisition Center does not intend to award a contract on the basis of your responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information presented or the use of any such information.  All proprietary information should be marked as such.  Responses indicating interest in this procurement as a prime or subcontractor are also requested. Interested parties should identify any GSA contracts or other established vehicles suitable for placing actions of this nature.  For more information, please contact Valerie Bray (732)  532-6499.  The deadline for responses is 26 May 2005.

<DESC>This is a Request For Information for the purposes of conducting market research. This RFI does not constitute a future contract and vendors shall not be compensated for providing information. There is no solicitation available at this time, The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (AO) is currently performing a market survey to determine if vendors exist that can meet the following concept. The AO is seeking sources capable of providing a suite of Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) software products supporting the following requirements:

Form Template Design Software Requirements:  The software should facilitate designing forms on Windows 2000/XP workstations.  The form template design software should have the following capabilities:

• User-friendly form editor to easily create and modify forms as business needs change
• Ability to easily create form elements such as radio buttons, check boxes, drop-down boxes
• Spell checking capability 
• Ability to create input fields with special types such as calendar, numeric, phone, email, social security number
• Ability to imbed static images such as logos into the form 
• Ability to add business logic and data validation edits to the form using an industry standard scripting or programming language
• Ability to easily upload a newly developed form to a forms management server

Form Management Server Processing Requirements:  The server software must allow end-users access to the forms through an HTTPS connection with only Internet Explorer and/or Adobe Reader client software required on the workstation.   No additional client licensing should be required for the users.   The software products should support connection to industry standard database servers through OLE-DB connections and support URL/web-service integration with existing Java applications.   It would be preferable that the software products include a software development kit (SDK).   The forms stored on the form management server should have the following capabilities:

• Ability to obtain data values from backend databases to pre-populate fields/drop-down boxes on the form through a server-based data connection (thus not requiring workstation connection to backend databases)
• Spell checking capability
• Ability to dynamically merge specific images/photos (from either backend databases or server-based directories of image files) into the form based on identifying information entered into the form.  This capability will allow a specific client photo to be stored on a form along with other identifying information from the backend server-database
• Ability to save partially finished forms and return at a later date to finish filling in the same form
• Ability to jump to or hide areas of the form based on responses in previous areas
• User-friendly form viewer/editor with input field business logic and data validation

<RESPDATE>061705
<ARCHDATE>02282006
<CONTACT>Michelle Hendricks, Contract Specialst; Patricia Krabacher, Contracting Officer; Vincent Lewis,Program Manager,937-255-3507 x3006; 937-904-4501;937-255-8345
<DESC>XR-SIMAF Capabilites Integration Services 17 May 05 Sources Sought Announcement Description The Air Force Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) Capabilities Development and Integration Directorate (ASC/XR) at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH anticipates a full and open competitive Request for Proposal (RFP) FY05Qtr 04 for performance-based services valued at approximately $90M in FY06 - FY10.   Constructive simulation, virtual simulation, and capabilities analyses support services are sought for the Simulation and Analysis Facility (SIMAF) and ASC/XR. The ASC/XR Mission is effects-based planning to maximize efficiency in delivering war-winning capability. XR provides planning interfaces across the aeronautical enterprise and to MAJCOM and HQ AFMC processes. Collaborative modeling, simulation, and analysis (MS+A) is seen as a key enabler of capabilities analyses and integration as well as system-of-systems (SoS) concepts for future capabilities.  The SIMAF is a secure facility capable of operating through the full range of security classifications.  Contractor personnel will be required to have the appropriate level of clearance to meet day-to-day operational requirements.   The scope of simulation efforts within the SIMAF spans weapons systems acquisition life cycles, from conceptual to developmental phases through sustainment, and may be executed in segregated or integrated air-to-air, air- to-ground, and surface-to-air environments as specified by the government.   Typical requirements are constructive simulation studies, virtual simulation studies, human system integration studies, distributed simulation events, and support for simulation events that may include live testing or direct test.   Five support functions structured as Performance Based Services are anticipated for FY06 thru FY10. Firms may propose one (except for E below which must be proposed in concert with at least one other area), two, three, four or all functions (approximate functional percentage of total effort is shown as percentage): A)	Capabilities Development and Integration (software development) (30%)  Typical areas of software development include, but are not limited to simulation specific code, weapons SoS network architectures, interfaces and protocols; computer system network architectures, interfaces and protocols; and data analysis software.  For more detail see Functional Area appendix in PIXS Library. B)	Event Planning, Development and Execution (15%),  Includes support simulation event planning, development, and execution activities which include, but are not limited to: coordination and/or assistance with software, database, and scenario development activities, analysis activities, and simulation hardware support activities. For more detail see Functional Area appendix in PIXS Library. C)	Simulation Analysis (20%) Typical analysis activities associated with constructive simulation studies, virtual simulation studies, distributed simulation events, and support for simulation events that may include live testing or direct tests.  Analyses areas of interest include, but are not limited to survivability, lethality, mission effectiveness, interoperability assessments, systems of systems architecture, and human system integration. For more detail see Functional Area appendix in PIXS Library. D)	Facility and Simulation Hardware Support (30% includes 15% Material  Purchases) The Simulation and Analysis Facility is a secure classified facility, which will require the following Facility support functions: Operational Support; Hardware Buildup; Facility Preparation; Hardware/Operator Interface (See the Functional Area appendix in the PIXS library). The Government will require the contractor(s) to provide support for the SIMAF Road-shows including equipment procurement, shipping, set-up, show support, and teardown. SIMAF will require various commercially available software and hardware to be purchased to sustain its daily facility and simulation operation. The Material to be procured will include: Computer Hardware, Cockpit Hardware, Simulation Systems, Visual and Graphic Display Systems, Computer Networking Equipment, Communications Systems. For more detail see Functional Area appendix in PIXS Library. E)	Enterprise Capabilities Integration Process Support (5%) ASC/XR strives to leverage MS+A techniques across aeronautical enterprise processes.  Both General Support and specific Project Support efforts are anticipated under this functional area. General Enterprise support consists of  participating in Integrated Analysis Team meetings, the Aeronautical Enterprise (AE) IPT, ASC/XR Capabilities Integration Board (CIB) meetings, the Aeronautical Enterprise Steering Group (AESG), analytical planning support to I-CRRA Action Items or Objectives, Cost Estimating capabilities toolsets, architecture product (e.g. OV-1) validation, participation with OEMs thru Wright Brothers Institute (WBI), etc. Project specific efforts likely to be tasked thru task order might include participating in project System Engineering Working Group (SEWG) and other MS+A related project working group meetings,  assisting in development of project specific analysis plans to include the appropriate mix of constructive, virtual, and hardware in the loop simulations!  , etc. , assisting in development of program management plans, test plans, etc, for project specific requirements,  working with specific projects in developing Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) support plans,  assisting in planning and executing assessments of competing conceptual approaches for a specific project such as support to a government source selection. The acquisition strategy currently contemplates a 60-month effort with a three- year CORE effort incrementally funded and two one-year options and Customer Event Task Orders.  An Indefinite Delivery/Requirements Time and Materials  (T+M) type contract is contemplated.    The estimated level of effort for this contract is approximately 55,000 labor hours for the first year, increasing by 10 percent per year thereafter for a total three year CORE effort of approximately 180,000 labor hours. The two option years have an estimated 65,000 labor hours each. Customer events will be supported using task orders.   Collaborative analysis involves significant challenges in protection of intellectual property and classified information. Associate contractor Agreement clauses will be utilized in each functional area contract that XR awards. An Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) clause 5352.209-9002 is anticipated to be necessary to emphasize the restrictions that will be levied upon recipients due to the need to protect Proprietary Information and Intellectual Property of other contractors. Individual employees will be required to execute a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).   A Top Secret facility/personnel security level will be required.  Top Secret clearances will be required for 50% of the staff at time of contract award.   All personnel must be capable of receiving a Top Secret clearance, although they are not expected to be necessary for everyone at this time.  All personnel will be required to hold a Secret clearance.  Foreign firms should be aware that restrictions apply which could preclude their receipt of any resulting contract.  ITAR restrictions apply in performance of these contracts.  To determine whether there are restrictions on receiving an award, foreign-owned firms are advised to contact the contracting officer or technical point of contact before submitting an SOC.  Submit only unclassified information for consideration and evaluation.  Statements of Capabilities (SOC) Organizations having capabilities in military operations research Modeling, Simulation and Analysis (MS+A), computer simulation requirements definition, exercise and test planning and implementation in a simulated environment, and scenario generation for large scale distributed simulations are invited to submit a SOC by 17 Jun 2005 for consideration.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS: It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. This agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protestor fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

DESCRIPTION: This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This is a Request for Proposals (OAM-2005-N-022). This combined synopsis/solicitation is organized into six parts: 1) General Requirements; 2) Basis of Brand Name; 3) Clause Supplements; 4) Cost Proposals; 5) Technical Evaluation and Award; 6) Point of Contact.

1. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS: GAO seeks quotes on an open market basis for continuing use of its installed base of NotifyLink Enterprise Server Software for GroupWise. The manufacturer of this software is Notify Technology Corporation, San Jose, CA.  Specific contact and product information may be found at www.Notifylink.com. This software is licensed on an annual basis. License fees comprise an annual amount per user for a total of 350 users. The period of performance is January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006, and up to four option years.

2. BASIS OF BRAND NAME: The basis of the Brand Name Justification is FAR 6.302-1.  GAO acquired 350 licenses in FY2004 of NotifyLink Enterprise Server Software for GroupWise in order to provide GroupWise email, contact, and task synchronization with wireless devices owned by GAO, and has subsequently deployed NotifyLink enabled devices to selected staff throughout the enterprise. GAO is not aware of any other technical solution that can be immediately deployed that would not involve acquisition of newer Java-enabled devices or specialized security solutions, both of which are not contemplated in the term of this contract. Operationally, NotifyLink remains the only solution to maintain continuing GroupWise synchronization.

3. CLAUSE SUPPLEMENTS: The following Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation and are incorporated by reference.

(C) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful proposal that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted. (i) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the proposal wrapper, electronic records, and other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel. (ii) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that proposals cannot be received at the office designated for receipt of proposals by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation, the time specified for receipt of proposals will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. (iii) Proposals may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before award. Oral proposals in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally.

Specifications for the  “Standardized Automatic Direction Finding System”

The Coast Guard is seeking to standardize the Automatic Direction Finding (ADF) system on Medium Endurance Cutters (WMEC) with a Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS),  “All in One” ADF system. The system shall direction find Medium, High, Very-High, Ultra-High, and Super High radio frequencies (MF/HF/VHF/UHF/SHF).  The system shall consist of a single receiver and a single antenna.  Components shall be available on the open market for a minimum period of three years after initial purchase. Upgrades to the system shall be backwards compatible. 
Key Selection Factors
a)Locate a State-Of-The-Art (today’s Technology) capable system manufacturer.
b)Ensure the vendor has the expertise required to provide a replacement system that meets or exceeds current ADF system(s) specifications.  These parameters include frequency spectrum, sensitivity, selectivity, and overall weight and power requirements.
c)Maintain the replacement system cost within a reasonable margin of the current total cost of the existing three (3) ADF systems presently in use, which include the KODEN KDF-580, KDF-538, and the KDF-581.
The “ALL in One” ADF system particulars:
a)The system should be PC controlled (Lap-Top computer or Desk-top) which includes the various functions of:
1.   Receiver control
2.   Antenna control
3.   DF display control
4.   System control and Data interface for the external computer system per the RS-232 standard.
b)The system should be modular in design to enhance system maintenance and upgrade capability.
c)The antenna system shall not exceed forty (40) pounds in weight and shall be survivable in the marine environment.  This environment pertains to operating in both arctic and tropical as well as temperate climates (with regard to temperature, humidity, etc.).  Additionally, the antenna shall operate properly when mounted atop a cutter mast of up to 150 Feet above sea level.
d)The receiver system shall cover a frequency range of 2 Mhz thru 2000 Mhz inclusive with no gaps in frequency coverage.  The receiver shall have the capability to store at a minimum, two (2) banks of 100 individual channels or frequencies.  One of the two banks shall be programmed and will be designated as Coast Guard specific (i.e. All Vhf Marine Channels and the five (5) specific distress frequencies listed below in para e.)  The additional bank of 100 channels will be utilized for operator storage of mission related frequencies, as desired.  The scanning functions of the receiver shall permit bank, channel, frequency, or frequency range programmable settings as desired by the operator.
e)The system shall be capable of monitoring / scanning any or all operator selected programmed channels  (frequencies) while providing scanning and direction finding capability for the following frequencies:
2182 Khz     International HF Calling and Distress
    	156.8 Mhz   VHF Marine Calling and Distress - Channel 16
    	121.5 Mhz   Civilian Air Distress
    	243.0 Mhz   Military Air Distress
        406.0 Mhz   EPIRB

Award will be made based on a best value analysis to include price, past performance, and quality.  Offerors should include past performance information along with their offer.  In addition, please include a short paragraph stating your approach to quality control.  




QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS REGARDING SOLICITATION

1. Maple Syrup process developed at University of Minnesota and an older version is available from Minnesota. Other processes may work.

2. http://www.in.nrcs.usda.gov/mlra11/manuscript_publications/Manuscripts.html this web site contains examples of Historical Indiana soil survey maps similar to the counties in the contract.

3. Mylar soil survey maps are about 24" X 14".

4. Rule of thumb tolerance is one soil line width error

5. Quality assurance is a photo image to image comparison with soil line placement.

6. Is it possible to receive a sample dataset or a sample soil map that is reflective of the soil maps to be rectified for these soil surveys?  Perhaps there is a current file on-line?

Yes. See question 2.


7.  Regarding the section "Work to be performed":  Is the use of the MAPLE SYRUP software a requirement for the winning contractor(s) or is an equivalent software package acceptable?  

Equivalent package may work OK.

8. How much ground area is covered in each map sheet? How much area in insets?  
Don't know. Total acres per county: Fayette: 137,653 Union: 105,755 Putnam: 308,625 Madison: 289,704 Morgan: 261,819

9. Would you provide a scanned sample of atlas sheets and soil overlay, so we can get a better idea what type of data will be supplied from your office.  
This was answered in other questions. They are half tome film positives at 1:12,000 scale of the original soil survey report atlas sheets. One copy is with photo image, the other without. 

10.  Is the MAPLE SYRUP a standard process required for this project? Will you supply the MAPLE SYRUP software for orthorectification?  
Other software may work. See other comments. 

11. Soil Overlay, Culture & Drainage overlay, are they in hardcopy or digital format?  
Half tome film positive mylars. 

12.  Does this compilation includes scanning all hard copy atlas sheets and rectify all of them (photobase, composite overlay, special feature, and soils overlay) or just Soil Survey map?  
All the sheets must be scanned and orthorectified. Labeled soil polygons digital file for the entire county should be delivered.   

13 Dem files: are they raster format or ASCII list? What is the grid spacing? Are they pieces of overlapped data or single piece Dem for each county?  
DEM files should be 10M raster format, individual tiles. 

14 Digital DOQQs: are they black/white or color geo-referenced TIFF image?  
black and white 

15. Final Data in ArcInfo Coverage, which version of the ArcInfo? Vector lines or polygons? 2D lines or 3D lines?  
ArcGIS 9 preferred. Polygons for soils, point and line files for special features. 
 
16.	As for ¡°Photo base separate¡±, I am assuming this
is non-rectified air photo, when was the photo taken? 
Can we find the focus length on the photo or some
record? Does the photo have the fiducial points on? We
plan to use ERDAS imagine or OrthoMapper
(http://www.surfacemapper.com/) to do this work and
those information are necessary.  we realized that you
suggest using MAPLE SYRUP software to do this work,
but the tool is not commercial software, we don¡¯t
know how to get it. If you require to use this tool to
finish the work, can we rent a copy from your office?

There should be 2 sets of 1:12,000 half tone film positives (mylar) for the survey areas. These are copies of the original soil survey map sheets. One set has photo background the other does not. We have no information regarding the original photos although this could perhaps be researched and ascertained. The SYRUP method was mentioned but other methods could perhaps be used. MAPLE SYRUP was developed at the University of Minnesota and the software is available but is only compatible with older versions of ERDAS imagine unless it is modified. We do not have the software.   

17.	What is Quarter Quadrangles? Is it soil survey map
based on DOQs? If so, we can clip the soil survey quad
from county coverage?

It depends. Some may work from the quarter quad base and mosaic a county coverage, others may do a county coverage and clip to quads.

18.	What is Soil Overlay, type positive? It is mylar
with the soil boundary lines? If so, there is nothing
on ¡°Photo base separate¡±?

See response to #16.

I.  SCOPE OF WORK
Background

The USAID Europe and Eurasia Bureau (E&E) is involved in a comprehensive program of assistance to the states of the former Soviet Union and to Central and Eastern Europe.  E&E’s strategy focuses on three core areas: economic restructuring and growth, democracy and governance and the social dimensions of transition.  In addition, USAID develops cross-sector approaches to address critical obstacles and changing circumstances in the region.  During 2003–2004, these include:   systematically addressing corruption and conflict in program analysis and design; further developing social sector initiatives to broaden the benefits of reform and thereby sustain public support for it; and raising the profile of values inherent in transition programs. .

Three essential elements of E&E’s assistance to the region include helping to establish full democracies rooted in good governance and anticorruption, nurturing vibrant market economies, and supporting the emergence of a responsive social safety net to meet the needs of the people, especially those disadvantaged during difficult times of transition.

Within E&E, the Office of Democracy, Governance and Social Transition (E&E/DGST) provides the Bureau and the USAID field missions in the region with technical and strategic expertise on policy and strategies; program design, development, implementation, monitoring and evaluation; and program management for democracy and governance and social transitions, especially marginalized populations, health, labor and social safety nets.  The Office has three teams; Social Transition, Health and Democracy.  The teams serve as the Bureau’s key technical liaison in their respective fields with other USAID Bureaus and Offices, U.S. government agencies (particularly the Department of State and Department of Justice), international donors and external stakeholders.

E&E recognizes that corruption constrains progress in all development sectors and subsectors, including democracy, rule of law, health, social transition, economic growth and energy.  E&E anti-corruption assistance is cross-cutting by supporting reforms intended to combat corruption within individual sector and subsector assistance programs.   E&E’s strategic approach in combating corruption utilizes USAID’s Anti-Corruption Strategy, as well as the Bureau’s programming emphasis on sector reforms that enhance Transparency, Accountability, Prevention, Education and Enforcement.  

E&E countries frequently suffer from poor governance and public administration practices, particularly in executive branches.   Recent changes in leadership in certain E&E countries, including Georgia and Ukraine, have enhanced opportunities in reforms and practices that enhance good governance within executive branch bodies.  Areas that may require assistance include developing procedures and practices that assist officials in: establishing priorities for policy formulation amidst competing priority needs and public expectations;  supporting and monitoring the implementation of new policies and reforms; ensuring the accountable performance of duties by officials and staff, including the proper handling of resources entrusted to them; establishing appropriate information flows vertically and horizontally within and across government bodies; and enhancing  information flows  to media and citizens.   
       
Position Overview

The incumbent is a member of E&E/DGST’s Democracy Team.  As part of the Democracy Team, S/He has primary responsibility for providing technical advice to the E&E Bureau, State Department, USAID field offices in the E&E region, and other units of USAID in all areas related to good governance and anti-corruption, including anti-corruption issues and efforts that impact progress in democracy, health, social transition [and economic growth] areas.   The incumbent works closely with other E&E sector specialists, the E&E Program Office,  and others in the Agency or Bureau involved with anticorruption, especially coordinating with DGST’s Senior Rule of Law Advisor. 

The incumbent also plays a critical role in defining and formulating the strategic focus and content of USAID’s anti-corruption assistance in E&E countries such that it complements programs implemented by other USG departments, including the Department of Justice and the Department of State/International Narcotics and Law Enforcement.  S/He represents the E&E Bureau in discussions regarding USAID/E&E anti-corruption and good governance assistance programs with the Office of the Assistance Coordinator for Europe & Eurasia at the Department of State.   S/He serves as an interlocutor among the E&E Bureau, USAID’s DCHA Bureau, State Department, and the Department of Justice    
The advisor is responsible for developing and/or managing regional projects to assist in development of good governance models and regional cooperation among states in pursuit of government reforms and, where relevant, issues pertaining to accession to the European Union or other international bodies.

The incumbent also assists USAID field offices in the region in responding to appropriate foreign government requests for consultation and technical assistance supporting good governance at any level of state government and combating corruption.


Duties and Responsibilities

a)  Provide Bureau leadership in the analysis of governance/public administration and corruption in the region.  This includes assisting USAID missions to formulate good governance and anticorruption strategies for individual countries; reviewing strategies submitted; leading and participating in governance and anticorruption assessments; directing good governance and anticorruption contract and/or grant evaluations; reviewing unsolicited proposals; and responding to Congressional inquiries.

b)  Serve as a senior advisor to the Europe and Eurasia Bureau with regard to the status of good governance and major anti-corruption initiatives in the E&E region, including activities of other USG agencies, host governments, other donors and non-governmental organizations.

Supervision

While the incumbent works under the direction of the Democracy Team Leader and coordinates with the Senior Rule of Law Advisor on Anti-Corruption, he/she needs to demonstrate a high degree of autonomy and responsibility.  As a recognized authority in the analysis and evaluation of programs and issues, the incumbent is subject only to administrative and policy direction concerning overall project priorities and objectives.  The incumbent is typically delegated complete responsibility and authority to plan, schedule and carry out major projects concerned with the analysis and evaluation of programs or organizational effectiveness.  Analyses, evaluations and recommendations developed by the incumbent are normally reviewed by management officials only for potential influence on broad agency policy objectives and program goals.  Findings and recommendations are often accepted without significant changes.

Required Skills and Qualifications
The Senior Governance/Anticorruption Advisor must be an individual with sound judgment, excellent writing and communication skills and have a well-developed understanding of U.S. foreign policy interests and the role USAID programming can play in the development of democracy. The successful candidate must be able to accomplish a wide range of assignments on short notice.  Since work often involves changes in program direction and implementation, including frequent coordination, the individual must be someone who is highly flexible and able to work on multiple tasks simultaneously.

In order to be considered for the position, a candidate must be a U.S. citizen and must submit an application in accordance with the guidance below in Section III, Applying.

<DESC>SECTION B – SUPPLIES OR SERVICES AND PRICES/COSTS

INTRODUCTION

This Contract is for Advisory and Assistance Services by non-governmental sources in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 37 – Service Contracting and Part 15--Negotiated Contracts.

B.l		Summary

B.1.1		USTDA is funding a Conference for Transportation and Trade Facilitation for South Asian Countries, which will take place in India in Fall 2005 or Winter 2006.  USTDA seeks to contract with a U.S. firm (Contractor) to research and write the Briefing Book for the conference.  The Contractor will propose a team with technical and business expertise in the Transportation infrastructure sector in South Asia.  

B.1.2.		With the support of several U.S. government agencies, the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) is planning a conference that will highlight issues and opportunities in Transportation and Trade Facilitation for South Asian countries.  

			The Conference will tentatively be held over two-and-a-half days in either Fall 2005 or Winter 2006, in India.  For bid preparation purposes, this timeframe and location should be assumed. 

In 2004, the World Bank presented empirical data demonstrating the low-levels of intra-regional and inter-regional trade for South Asia.  This report proposed the implementation of specific measures to facilitate trade and to lower trade logistics costs.  The World Bank report focuses on port efficiency, customs environment, regulatory environment, and service-sector infrastructure as key investment areas that could raise intra-regional trade by $2.6 billion.  The area that will produce the greatest gains is service-sector infrastructure, followed by air and maritime ports.  Transportation and trade facilitation was a key topic in the World Bank’s Global Economic Prospects 2004 report as well as the World Bank/IMF Annual Meetings in the Fall of 2004.  Further, transportation and trade facilitation projects are now starting to figure more prominently in developing countries’ Country Assistance Strategies and lending operations with the World Bank – which are key procurement opportunities for U.S. companies.

Significant opportunities for U.S. transportation firms exist in South Asia despite differing levels of development throughout the region.  The following countries are expected to participate in this regional conference:  Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.  South Asian countries recognize the critical nature of improvements in this sector, and are making concrete steps to obtain appropriate assistance in identifying and meeting their needs.  This is also a region where there is significant competition from European countries.  

 
Topics which could be addressed during the conference may include, but are not limited to:

·	Transportation linkages
·	Private management of transportation systems
·	Rehabilitation and improvements to systems
·	Port Container Systems
·	Air traffic management
·	Aviation infrastructure development
·	Rail, port, highway improvements
·	Rural roads projects
·	Container Security Initiative (CSI) certifications

The agenda will be designed with these objectives in mind.  Offerors shall provide a draft agenda reflecting the conference objectives as part of the bid.

The conference will bring together public and private sector project sponsors and transportation sector and trade facilitation government leaders from the national, state, and municipal levels in the participating countries, as well as a range of U.S. equipment suppliers and service providers catering to this industry.  In preparing the bid for this conference, offerors should consider industry competitiveness and the targeted U.S. company audience for the event.  

We are targeting approximately 175 U.S. and foreign participants, with at least 50 U.S. company representatives and approximately 30 project delegates from the participating countries.  The conference will aim to balance policy and project objectives, and will feature one-on-one meetings, project presentations, and panel/roundtable discussions.

M.1.  		EVALUATION OVERVIEW

M.1.1		Information relevant to these criteria must be presented in accordance with the instructions in Section L.
	
M.1.2		The criteria have been tailored to the requirements of this particular solicitation.  Offerors should note that these criteria: (a) serve as the standard against which all technical proposals will be evaluated; (b) serve to identify the significant matters which Offerors should address in their technical proposals; and (c) will constitute 90% of the total evaluation criteria.

M.1.3		The Government may: (1) reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; (2) accept other than the lowest offer; and (3) waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. The Government may award a contract on the basis of initial offers received, without further discussion or negotiations. 

M.1.4		Award will be made to that Offeror: (1) whose proposal is technically acceptable; and (2) whose technical/cost relationship is most advantageous to the Government. While cost is secondary to technical, it will be a factor in the award decision. Award may not necessarily be made to that Offeror submitting the lowest cost proposal. Also, award may not necessarily be made for technical capabilities that would appear to exceed those needed for the successful performance of the work. The Government reserves the right to make cost/technical trade-offs that are in the best interest and to the advantage of the Government.

M.1.5		Technical proposal shall constitute 90 percent of the overall score, while cost shall constitute 10 percent of the overall score.  The Offeror submitting the lowest cost proposal shall receive 10 points.  Each Offeror thereafter, shall be awarded points for cost in descending order, as described in Section M 4.

M.1.6		The factors used by the Government in determining the winning proposal are listed in Sections M.2 through M.4 in the order of their relative importance.  Quality will be subjectively judged in terms of technical excellence, capability, prior experience or past performance, schedule, and strategy.  The Government reserves the right to make selection decisions that are in the best interest and to the advantage of the Government on the basis of factors specified in this Solicitation.

M.1.7		Award may be made without further discussion or negotiations. The proposal should be submitted initially in the most favorable terms, from a cost and technical standpoint, which the Offeror can submit to the Government.

 
M.2		EVALUATION CRITERIA – TECHNICAL EXPERTISE (CATEGORY 1)

In determining the best proposal from a technical expertise standpoint, the following factors will be considered:

M.2.1	The Offeror’s relevant technical experience and skills/capabilities in the sector; and knowledge of the country, region and/or projects.  (20/90)

M.2.2	Relevant experience with financing mechanism(s) most likely to be used to implement projects subject to the subject of the Briefing Book. (5/90)

M.2.3	Relevant experience in project identification, development or 
Evaluation of projects for conference Briefing Book.(20/90)

M.2.4	Relevant sector contacts, publications or reports, past performance on similar work for USTDA or any other value-added assets. (5/90)

M.3		BRIEFING BOOK STRATEGY OR APPROACH
 		(CATEGORY 2)

M.3.1  	Understanding of USTDA objectives and prospective project(s) in this sector, as demonstrated in Offeror’s Briefing Book strategic approach. (10/90)

M.3.2	Offeror’s discussion and strategy for identifying projects and for evaluating economic and financial viability of projects. (10/90)

M.3.4	Offeror’s understanding of relevant policy issues and themes to be addressed during the conference. (15/90)

M.3.5	Quality, succinctness and presentation of proposal. (5/90)

M.4		EVALUATION CRITERIA PRICE/COST 

EXAMPLE

The lowest cost proposal is divided by price of proposal being evaluated, x 10 
equals the final price/cost score.  The lowest cost proposal will always receive 10
Points as illustrated below:







Item		Offeror’s  Cost Proposal			Score
01			$25,000				8 Points
02			$23,450				9 Points
03			$21,200				10 Points (Lowest Price)

01		$21,200 Divided By $25,000 X 10 = 8 Points
02		$21,200 Divided By $23,450 X 10 = 9 Points

M.5		 POST AWARD BRIEFINGS

M.5.1		After receipt of notice of contract award, unsuccessful Offerors have three days to request a debriefing.

M.5.2		Debriefings will be provided, to the maximum extent practicable, within five days of the agency's receipt of a request for the debriefing.

M.5.3		Debriefings, at a minimum, will include: USTDA’s comments on the Offeror's proposal; the overall cost and technical ranking of the successful Offeror and the overall cost and technical ranking of the Offeror being debriefed; the overall ranking of all offers; and a summary of the rationale for the award. 

M.5.4		Debriefings will not include point-by-point comparisons of the proposal submitted by an unsuccessful Offeror with the successful Offeror's proposal.

Contractor Selection Technical Assistance on the Rehabilitation of the Kairakkum and Varzob Cascade Hydropower Plants Feasibility Study Project in Tajikistan

Solicitation # USTDA-05-Q-81-229 


When will the tender for the feasibility be released? 

The Rehabilitation of the Kairakkum and Varzob Cascade Hydropower Plants Project Feasibility Study Request for Proposals (RFP) release is not yet scheduled.  It will depend on receiving feedback from the Tajikistan Ministry of Energy (Grantee) concerning the draft Request for Proposals.  Most likely the RFP will be released the first week in June with proposals due in mid-July.


Is it planned that the TA input on the bid evaluation system would be provided before that, so the evaluation system can be described in the tender documents?

The RFP is expected to be issued before the Contractor Selection TA consultant is selected, so it is not expected that the TA consultant would have input on the Award Criteria for the Feasibility Study in the RFP.  However, the award criteria in the RFP are top-level or general and are derived from the suggested award criteria in the USTDA Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan Hydropower Sector Definitional Mission Report.  Therefore it is useful for the TA consultant to develop relevant sub-criteria for potential adoption by the Grantee.  Any sub-criteria would have to fit within and be true to the general Award Criteria in the RFP.
