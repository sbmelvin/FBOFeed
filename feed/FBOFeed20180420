<DESC>This announcement is a Market Survey / Request for Information (RFI) for the purpose of soliciting statements of interest and capabilities from interested vendors.  Responses to this announcement will be used for informational purposes only to support the development of an acquisition strategy for the contemplated Controller Training Solutions (CTS) acquisition. The information will not be released, except as required under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA); proprietary information will be protected if appropriately marked. 

This is not a Screening Information Request or Request for Proposal.  

The FAA has an on-going requirement for Air Traffic Controller (ATC) Training to maintain a well-trained and fully-staffed ATC workforce.  This training is composed of classroom, laboratory/simulation and refresher training components.  This requirement includes contractor augmentation of FAA resources for developing, planning, and performing ATC training and training related services.  The FAA CTS requirement is intended to fulfill five critical FAA needs: 

1.   Instructional and training services support at the FAA Academy and up to 315 FAA facilities nationwide
2.   Nationwide availability of qualified ATC instructors
3.   Workforce management of roughly 1,500 instructors and support staff
4.   Air Traffic Controller Training Curriculum maintenance and development
5.   Developing or implementing innovations and enhancements to Air Traffic Controller Training

CTS will provide the FAA with a flexible contract vehicle to obtain qualified instructors, training support, and training development services for variable durations at locations and times determined by the FAA.  The goal for CTS is to meet all known FAA training needs while retaining the flexibility to increase or decrease the service level as required by workforce and budget constraints.

Included as Attachment A to this announcement is the draft Statement of Work (SOW) for the CTS acquisition.  The FAA requests responses from industry to include the following: 

a.   Capability Statement (defined below) 
b.   OPTIONAL: Market Survey Posting Information.  Interested vendors may complete and submit the attached Interested Parties Form (Attachment B) for the purpose of publicly disclosing their interest in subcontracting / teaming arrangements for this potential opportunity.  Per agreement permission on the interested parties form, the FAA will publish this data at the time of the FAA’s next update to this opportunity.  Inclusion in this interested vendor listing is not a requirement or in any way, a precursor for consideration in a future solicitation based on this market survey.

Capability Statement: 

Responders must provide a Capability Statement that
addresses the following: 

1.   Describe your firm’s ability to provide specialized training resources, nationwide, on short notice, and with varying service-durations.
2.   Describe your firm’s ability to provide flexible classroom training and simulation support in a in-residence academic environment such as the FAA Academy in Oklahoma City
3.   Describe your firm’s ability to develop and maintain Air Traffic Controller Training curricula
4.   Describe your firm’s approach to providing innovations and enhancements to Air Traffic Controller Training
5.   Describe your firm’s understanding and experience with FAA Air Traffic Control training procedures and methods.  The description must demonstrate your firm’s capability to perform work of similar size, scope, and complexity as the work indicated above and in Attachment A.  
6.   Performance Management: describe your firm’s process for ensuring successful performance of the contract requirements.
7.   The FAA encourages teaming arrangements.  Describe any use of subcontractors, Joint Venture arrangements, affiliated offerors or an FAA approved Mentor/Protégé arrangement to fulfill CTS requirements

This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.   

The NAICS code for this requirement is 611430: Professional Development Training with a small business size standard of $11M.

This Market Survey must not be construed as an obligation on the part of the FAA to acquire these items.  Since this is not a Screening Information Request or Request For Proposal, no results will be issued to the responding firms. No solicitation for these items exists at this time. If a solicitation is issued, it will be announced on the FAA Contract Opportunities website. It is the vendor’s responsibility to monitor the website for release of the solicitation.  The FAA will not entertain or accept unsolicited proposals for this work.

The FAA will not be liable for any costs associated with the preparation of responses to this Market Survey, nor reimburse or otherwise pay any costs incurred by any party responding to this announcement.  Any costs associated with the Market Survey submissions will be solely at the interested party’s expense.  

The FAA may request that one, some, all, or none of the respondents to the Market Survey/Request for Information provide additional information. No evaluation of vendors will occur based on this additional information, and vendor participation in any informational session is not a promise for future business with the FAA. 

Interested vendors’ responses must be submitted by email no later than 5:00 P.M. Eastern Time on May 21, 2018.  Responses to this Market Survey are limited to 15 pages and must be in writing, on company letterhead, and must include respondent point of contact information including name, telephone number, e-mail address, and mailing address. The optional Interested Parties Form (Attachment B) is not included in the page limitation. Any proprietary information submitted must be properly identified. Information from vendor submissions may be used in future acquisition activities on a non-vendor specific basis.  

Any questions must be submitted by email to the point-of-contact noted below no later than 5:00 P.M. Eastern Time on April 26, 2018.  The FAA will publish questions and answers to this opportunity. Questions will not be vendor-attributed.

<DESC>Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 9609 Medical Center Drive, Room 1E132, Bethesda, MD 20892, UNITED STATES
<p>Description <br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), National Toxicology Program (NTP) plans to procure on a sole source basis the creation of Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models from data derived from studies of the fate and biological effects of environmental chemicals in humans and rodents from Biosimulation Consulting, 2915 Ogletown Road #1182, Newark, DE 19713 USA<br /><br />The purpose of this acquisition is to complete unfinished PBPK models and to establish PBPK models for additional chemicals of interest using the same methods and techniques.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1) and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6. The North American Industry Classification System code is 541380 and the business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>Only one (1) award will be made as a result of this solicitation.</p>
<p>It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.</p>
<p>The Center for Cancer Research (CCR) at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) investigates the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of potential environmental toxicants. These studies are conducted in rodents with the ultimate goal of providing data for extrapolation to assess risk of exposure to humans. Mathematical modeling of these data using PBPK methods can be used for extrapolation of results between doses, routes of exposure, and species. Further, applying this approach to data analysis may result in a reduction in animal numbers through predictive study design. The project will support epidemiologists and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) for modeling chemical contaminant data derived from blood samples collected during the Anniston Community Health Survey.</p>
<p>The goal of the project is to build a PBPK model to predict the fate of the contaminants in the populations identified in the Anniston Community Health Survey (Anniston Project) in humaand rodents. The goal is to publish a report (manuscript) describing the major pharmacokinetic of persistent organic pollutants identify during biomonitoring. This description would help to understand the relation between internal dose of the majors persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and the health effects observed, and to support the human risk assessment for health in the Anniston project</p>
<p>The Contractor shall have the requisite knowledge, skills, and abilities to create PBPK models from data collected from human derived samples (data will be shared from CDC/ATSDR), provided from the laboratories of co-investigators, or derived from the literature. These models will be used to support toxicological evaluations and risk assessments of these chemicals. The Contractor will model chemical data from animal- or human-derived samples (data will be shared from CDC/ATSDR) using PBPK models already developed or a modified PBPK model for this specific modeling tasks. The contractor will work with Dr. Birnbaum and the epidemiologists of Anniston project to limit the objectives of this modeling.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall perform the following tasks:</p>
<p>Project Management Plan</p>
<p>The Contractor shall develop an overall project plan for the Scope of the project. The Project Management Plan shall describe the development and implementation of the requirements under this contract and detail the timing and mode of key operations.</p>
<p>Task 1: Generation of multiple PBPK models for individual chemicals, based on different exposure scenarios (e.g. male and/or female rats and/or mice). The Contractor shall initially develop a PBPK model for hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD/HBCD) for the na&iuml;ve rodent. PBPK models may be requested to support observations of a specific mechanism of action, target tissue, route of exposure or excretion, or metabolic pathway. When requested, the Contractor shall extend a model to include embryonic and fetal compartments as well as assess different exposure timelines. Further, the Contractor may be requested to convert rodent PBPK models to human PBPK models.<br /><br />Task 2: To develop PBPK models from data derived from studies of the fate and biological effects of environmental chemicals in humans (Anniston Community Health Survey). This task will support epidemiologists and the NIEHS for modeling chemical contaminant data derived from blood samples collected during the Anniston Community Health Survey. The present goal of the project is to build a PBPK model to predict the fate of the contaminants in the populations identified in the Anniston Community Health Survey (Anniston Project). The Contractor will model chemical data from human derived samples (data will be shared from CDC/ATSDR) using PBPK models already developed or a modified PBPK model for this specific modeling tasks.</p>
<p>This is a firm fixed price purchase order.</p>
<p>The period of performance shall be for 12 months from time of award</p>
<p>All work shall be performed at the Contractor's facility.<br /><br />The Contractor shall submit all required report(s)/deliverables in accordance with the following schedule: <br /><br />DELIVERABLES and DESCRIPTION DUE DATE<br /><br />1. The Contractor shall provide monthly progress reports of the work by email to the COR. A final report, which may consist of a manuscript suitable for submission to a peer-reviewed journal, shall be due at completion of the Hexabromocyclododecane model. The Contractor may be requested to combine some models into a single final report for publication purposes. Monthly reporting from initiation of contract, final report due 12 months from the date of award.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Contractor shall provide monthly progress reports of the work by email to the COR. A final report, which may consist of a manuscript suitable for submission to a peer-reviewed journal, shall be due at completion of the Anniston model. The Contractor may be requested to combine some models into a single final report for publication purposes. 12 months from the date of completion of task 1.<br /><br />3. &nbsp;A complete listing of following additional information: procedures used; description of the experimental design; methods used for statistical analyses of data; anything unusual about the data or models, any deviation from these procedures, and any other relevant information. 12 months from the date of award.</p>
<p>BioSimulation Consulting, Inc has the capability and capacity to complete unfinished PBPK models initiated under the previous contract at the greatest efficiency in terms of time and cost to the U.S. Government. Other contractors would be expected to recreate previous achievements. Based on past performance, BioSimulation Consulting, Inc continuity is needed to complete unfinished PBPK models. BioSimulation Consulting work is of high standard and their expertise, methods, and techniques are required to ensure an acceptable level of comparison between previous and future models developed by BioSimulation Consulting, Inc for the CCR.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City Division, (NSWC PCD), Panama City, FL intends to award a sole-source firm-fixed price purchase order to QinetiQ North America, 350 Second Avenue Building 1, Waltham, MA 02451 for developing advanced low-power shallow-water sidescan sonar technology. This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons: The technologies being investigated are proprietary to QinetiQ North America, developed as part of an internal sonar development effort that allowed Simultaneous Transmit and Receive (STAR) through front end analog pulse cancellation allowing the receivers to detect returns without any blanking periods. These technologies also encompass Code Division Multiple Access that allows nadir filling and side-scanning using simultaneous port and starboard transmissions. Therefore, QinetiQ Company is the only known source capable of performing the tasking of this procurement.  Delivery of the base year report will be no later than twelve (12) after award of the order. The delivery of the option year report will be no later than twelve (12) months after award of option year.  Est $200,000 including option. NAICS Code 541715 applies. Small Business Size standard 1000 employees. PSC is R413.

The Contractor shall also be very familiar with general software practices in other domains that implement complex, software-intensive control systems. These systems are characterized by advanced, heterogeneous sensors to enable autonomous control capability, and in which connectivity through internal and external networks is leveraged by the software to enhance system performance. The Contractor will produce an original high-quality seminal volume with visionary insight and perspective from career experience, and from a rigorous review of literature and outreach to key academic, industry, and government sources. This seminal volume will be a highly thoughtful examination and study that reflects the Contractor's deep integration of knowledge spanning the automotive control system software build, test and validation activities associated with the lifecycle development, production, and maintenance of automotive software-rather than a recitation of introductory computer science and software engineering concepts.

Such documentation will be utilized solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to set this solicitation aside for small business. The Government will not pay for any documentation provided in response to this synopsis and documentation received will not be returned to the sender. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement as a small business set-aside, based upon responses received to the synopsis, is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>NOTE: The Volpe Center uses electronic commerce to issue requests for proposals and amendments. Paper copies will not be made available. The solicitation and any related documents will be issued on the Government Point of Entry knows as FedBizOpps (www.fbo.gov) All contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM), located at www.sam.gov, in order to receive an award from a DOT Agency.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">The United States Agency for International Development in Indonesia (USAID/Indonesia) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for a five-year contract for USAID/Indonesia Tuberculosis Private Sector (TBPS) activity. USAID intends to use full and open competition for this procurement. The solicitation is anticipated to be released in about two weeks and will be made available electronically upon its release to </span><a href="http://www.fbo.gov/"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">www.fbo.gov</span></a><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"> . </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">The purpose of the TBPS activity is to contribute to national goals to reduce tuberculosis (TB) prevalence and incidence by ensuring clients who seek care in the private sector receive quality-assured TB services. USAID&rsquo;s support will facilitate and enable the development, implementation, and evaluation of strategies that strengthen the private primary healthcare level, and secondary care of Multi-Drug Resistant TB (MDR-TB) to appropriately provide the continuum of TB care to care-seeking clients while reducing the burden and costs to the Government of Indonesia (GOI) at the secondary care level.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">The goal of TBPS is to increase the number of care-seeking clients in the private sector who are correctly diagnosed, notified, and have completed TB treatment. USAID envisions that, with the support of this TBPS activity, private providers and clients will be better integrated into the overall health system, building greater cooperation and collaboration between the National TB Program and the private sector.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Prospective Offerors are advised that this procurement is subject to internal USAID approvals and the availability of funds. This is NOT an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and in no way obligates the US Government to issue an RFP/IFB and/or award a contract. This notice satisfies the synopsis requirement in FAR 5.2. If a solicitation is issued, all necessary information will be supplied at the time it is posted at </span><a href="http://www.fbo.gov/"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">www.fbo.gov</span></a><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"> . </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Questions/requests for information will not be responded to until RFP issuance.

The scope of this project is the architectural and engineering (A&E) services necessary to accomplish this relocation, including space programming, planning, and design; cost estimating and construction bid phase services; and construction administration services.  The construction scope is expected to include renovations of existing office space, construction of new laboratory space, and improvements to service yards and employee parking.
The USGS contemplates award of a firm-fixed price contract in accordance with the procedures of FAR Subpart 36.6, Architect-Engineer Services.  The request for qualifications, including a detailed statement of work and contractor evaluation criteria, will be available on or after 05/07/2018 - do not submit your qualifications in response to this announcement.  
The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS, 2017) code is 541310, "architectural services."  The associated size standard is $7.5M in average (three year moving average) annual revenue.  The applicable Product Service Code (PSC) is C1AA, "architect and engineering - construction: office buildings."

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Savannah District intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) W912HN18R3010 for the Repair of NCOA Advanced Skills Training Barracks Repair, Building 24404, Ft. Gordon, GA, Richmond County. This project is required to correct failed and failing systems in an approximately 37,000 square foot, three-story barracks built in 1988.

Work includes repair of failing Mechanical, Electrical, and Plumbing systems and components, mold and mildew damage, and fire alarm and mass notification upgrades. Project will replace the existing HVAC system with new fan coil units and a dual temperature piping system with a four pipe chilled and hot water distribution system. Mechanical controls will be fully compatible and controlled by the installation's centrally managed Utilities Management Control System (UMCS). Project also includes repair of building envelope and building interior, replacement of all windows to meet Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection standards, new wall and flooring finishes, replacement of all plumbing fixtures, replacement of light fixtures with LED technology, and removal of hazardous materials including Lead Based Paint and Asbestos Containing Material.
<p>This will be a competitive acquisition for the award of a Firm Fixed-price C-type contract utilizing a Low Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) best-value procurement method.

The Government will evaluate the proposals beginning with the lowest price to the highest price until it reaches the first responsive and responsible Offeror who achieves Acceptable ratings in both factors. That Offeror will be selected for award and the remainder of the proposals will not be evaluated. Pricing will not be rated during the past performance and experience evaluation, but it will be reviewed for price reasonableness, and in response to funding limitations. Only one award will be made from this solicitation to the Offeror whose proposal represents the best overall value. The basis of award is to make award to the Offeror whose proposal is technically acceptable and has the lowest price determined to be fair and reasonable and within funds available. The Government may make award without discussions, so Offerors should not automatically assume they will not have an opportunity to participate in discussions or be asked to submit a revised offer.<br /><br />In accordance with FAR 36.204(g) the disclosure of magnitude is between $5,000,000.00 and $10,000,000.00.

<SOLNBR>W912EF18B0022
<CONTACT>Julie Morris, Phone 5095277227, Email Julie.M.Morris@usace.army.mil
<DESC>Construction project entitled: Gooding Diversion Project Rehabilitation.  The construction will occur on the Little Wood River near Gooding, Idaho.  Construction magnitude is estimated to be between $500,000 and $1,000,000.  Performance and payment bonds will be required.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this project is 237990 and the associated small business size standard is $36,500,000.  Solicitation is open to women-owned small business concerns.
<p>Summary of Scope of Work:</p>
<p>The concrete diversion structures are located on the Little Wood River northeast of the City of Gooding, which also marks the beginning of the channel.  The outlet dam and outlet channel are located approximately 3 miles below the channel on the old channel for the Little Wood River.  The site is accessible at several points by local and residential roads.</p>
<p>The high flows caused undermining of the diversion outlet apron, headcutting, and eventual erosion of the channel.  The end wall separated from the outlet apron leading to undermining of the apron and end wall.  The left bank channel wall directly downstream of the diversion structure eroded.</p>
<p>Restoring to the as-was condition involves removing the under mined concrete section and replacing it with an outlet apron that will not be susceptible to head cutting in the near future.  Suitable fill material and bedding for the new outlet apron will be placed in the channel.  The left side channel wall will also be filled and graded.  A new outlet apron and side walls will be placed in the same footprint.  The end of the outlet apron will have a stem wall for stability.  A well graded two foot diameter (max) rip rap will fill the area in the channel downstream of the basin that was eroded due to head cutting.</p>
<p>The estimated period of performance is July 2018 - December 2018. <br /> <br />All on-site work shall be performed in accordance with the Corps of Engineers Safety and Health Requirements Manual (EM 385-1-1).<br /> <br />Establish and manage an effective on-site Safety and Health program in accordance with EM 385-1-1 that will require the development and submission of a comprehensive project specific Accident Prevention Plan for Government acceptance. In addition, develop and submit for Government acceptance Activity Hazard Analyses for each phase of work and a project specific Fall Protection Plan that comply with EM 385-1-1.</p>

<DESC><br />THIS SYNOPSIS IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. Program Executive Officer, Land Systems Marine Corps, (PEO LS) Medium and Heavy Tactical Vehicles (MHTV) intends to enter into sole source negotiations and subsequently award an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to Oshkosh Defense LLC, 2307 Oregon Street, Oshkosh, WI 54902-7062 (CAGE 75Q65) . This effort is estimated for award in the third quarter of Fiscal Year 2018 with an approximate period of performance of a 12-month base period with four 12-month option years. <br /><br />The anticipated IDIQ contract is to procure spare parts, engineering, programmatic, technical and logistical support for the Logistics Vehicle System Replacement (LVSR) Family of Vehicles (FoV). These services to be performed by Oshkosh are identified as follows:
<p>&bull; Not to exceed 10,000 engineering/modeling and simulation hours over five (5) years to support live fire and performance testing required by the Government as a result of any agreed upon changes to the LVSR cab structure. <br />&bull; Up to four (4) technicians per year over five (5) years to remove and re-install the cab and its components during pre and post warranty restoration efforts.<br />&bull; Repair of vehicle damage, not covered by warranty, that would prevent reconditioning of the cab or affect safe operation of the vehicle. <br />&bull; Support the installation of approved engineering changes that would be beneficial to the Government while the vehicle is out-of-service, such as new, improved door locks, emergency egress windows, etc.</p>
<p>The Government has determined that Oshkosh is the only commercial company capable of performing these support services because the Government is currently unable to provide the technical data necessary to support competition of the live fire test events, performance and durability testing, and access to Oshkosh's engineering/model and required simulation support. Therefore, PEO-LS cannot provide the technical data in order to foster a competitive procurement. <br /><br />THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This acquisition is being pursued on a sole source basis under the statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(A) "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements". Unless stated herein, no additional information is available. Requests for additional information will be disregarded. Responsible interested parties may submit a capability statement in which they identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The capability statement must be received by PEO-LS within seven calendar days after the date of the publication of this synopsis. The U.S. Government (USG) will consider all information received by the response date. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses received as a result of this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All submissions become USG property and will not be returned. Contractors are advised the USG will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this notice of intent. The North American Industry Classification System code is 336992, Military Armored Vehicle, Tank and Tank Component Manufacturing.</p>
