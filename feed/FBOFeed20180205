<ARCHDATE>03092018

<a href="mailto:keri.henderson@faa.gov">Click here to email Keri Hendesron</a>
<DESC>In accordance with Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (AMS) Policy 3.2.1.2.1, Market Analysis, this announcement is to conduct a Request For Information (RFI) for the purpose of soliciting industry input, statements of interest, and capabilities from vendors. The responses to this RFI will be used for information purposes only and will not be released, except as required under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Vendor proprietary information will be protected if appropriately marked. This announcement does not guarantee procurement and will not be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract, nor is this announcement a Screening Information Request (SIR) or Request for Proposals (RFP). The FAA is neither seeking nor accepting unsolicited proposals. A potential future procurement will include adherence to appropriate AMS Buy American clauses.

INTRODUCTION:

The FAA is seeking interested vendors that are capable of providing Virtual Integrated Training Systems and continued life-cycle support of established virtual systems. At this RFI stage, the FAA is seeking industry input concerning potential solutions to provide virtual training. These systems provide virtual maintenance and operational training to the FAA Power Service Program. The development of new training systems and upgrades to existing training systems will include training for individual, team, and/or multi-team training requirements for the power service team throughout the United States. These systems include, but are not be limited to: 

Engine Generators
Uninterruptable Power Supplies
DC BUS power supplies, Battery Systems
Air Route Traffic Control Center Essential Power Systems
Critical Power Distribution Systems
Electrical Line Distribution Systems
Safety Systems associated with these programs such as Arc Flash Hazard training 

BACKGROUND:

The Technical Operations Training Division at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in Oklahoma City currently provides training to Power Service engineers and technicians to maintain the reliability of the National Airspace System (NAS). Students undergo Enhanced Hands-On Training (EHOT) where they incorporate knowledge and skills of equipment operation, work practices (e.g., use of maintenance handbooks, technical documentation, etc.), and troubleshooting techniques. These trainings provide the knowledge and skills needed to maintain, repair, and monitor NAS equipment and systems. FAA Power Service Program hopes to create efficiency and cost savings for the EHOT by creating a Virtual Integrated Training System so engineers and technicians have the capability to be trained at their leisure without requiring travel, and being able to have the most up to date troubleshooting techniques. The FAA was anticipating some form of VR goggle or helmet system (in lieu of a training room) that could be shipped from facility to facility. The nature of these goggles or helmet are open to what is currently available, as well as any current developmental systems. The system is anticipated to be current COTS with existing applications in remote training systems.
 
CAPABILITY STATEMENT AND REQUIRED DOCUMENTS:

Interested vendors that have the capabilities to develop Virtual Integrated Training systems must address the following: 
1. The capability to design, develop, integrate, test, deliver, and sustain life cycle support for a new Virtual Integrated Training Systems (software and hardware) in support of various locations;
2. The capability to develop and modify training systems utilizing COTS gaming engines;
3. The capability to convert existing training program/documentation into real time interactive Systems;
4. Provide, in detail, proposed software and required equipment needed to accomplish virtual training; and 
5. Provide historical Rough Orders of Magnitude (ROM) for public or private sector projects within your capability with similar requirements (include the ROM for development of the software and required hardware). 

SMALL BUSINESS:

At this time, the nature of the competition has not been determined. The FAA may decide to set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBAs 8(a) Program. The Principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) size standard code for this requirement is 611519 -- Other Technical and Trade Schools with a size standard of $15 Million. If you believe that another NAICS code is more appropriate to the work, include supporting justification with your alternate NAICS code. Suggestion of an alternate NAICS code does not require that the work be set-aside or solicited under that alternative code.

The FAA will consider information submitted in response to this RFI in determining the method and type of procurement competition. The failure to obtain adequate and appropriate SBA 8(a) or other small business participation may result in a determination to conduct this procurement under other competitive procedures.

The FAA requires copies of certification letters for interested service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in the SBAs 8(a) Program.  

RESPONSES:

Please include the following in your response to this request:
1. Capability Statement addressing the five required areas (not to exceed 20 pages)
2. Copy of SBA 8(a) Certification Form and/or proof of service-disabled veteran-owned small business status (if applicable)

SUBMISSION FORMAT:

Email your response to Keri Henderson and Ryan Thompson at keri.henderson@faa.gov and ryan.thompson@faa.gov at 2:00 p.m. EST on March 9, 2018. The electronic submission should be in either Microsoft WORD format or portable document format (PDF). Submission must include company Point(s) of Contact, telephone number(s), E-mail address(es), and mailing address.

This RFI is for informational purposes only and is not a commitment or a promise by the Government to contract. The Government is not liable for costs associated with the preparation, submittal of inquiries, or responses to this announcement; all costs associated with the RFI submissions will be solely at the interested partys expense.

Acquisition Plan Action ID: VA246-18-AP-2598

1.  Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs Network Contracting Office (NCO) 6, on behalf of the VA Medical Center in Asheville, North Carolina, proposes to procure Brand Name microbiology plated material under purchase request (redacted).

2.  Brief Description of Supplies/ Services required and the intended use/Estimated Amount:  VAMC Asheville requires Becton Dickinson (BD) brand microbiology plated media for use in recurring daily laboratory testing.  The annual estimated value is (redacted); total contract value is estimated at (redacted).

3.  Unique characteristics that limit availability to only one source, with the reason no other supplies or services can be used:  This Justification authorizes Brand Name Only (Becton Dickinson) brand media, which is currently in use at the medical center; introducing new media would require extensive validation studies.

4.  Description of market research conducted and results or statement why it was not conducted:  In accordance with FAR 10.002 requirements, market research was conducted.  In addition to Internet searches for capable vendors, a Sources Sought Notice was published at Federal Business Opportunities (www.FBO.gov) from December 13, 2017 through December 18, 2017 which provided sufficient responses regarding the availability of Veteran-Owned Small Businesses with apparent capability to meet the requirement. Two Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses responded to the Notice; however, only one of these businesses had clear capability to meet the requirement.  Additionally, one capable Veteran-Owned Small Business responded to the Notice, as well as two Large Business concerns.

5.  Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<SOLNBR>SB134118RQAMD1
<RESPDATE>021618
<CONTACT>Grace H. Parker, Phone 3019752345, Email grace.parker@nist.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) using Simplified Acquisition Procedures, with Community Initiatives, located at 354 Pine Street, Suite 700, San Francisco, CA 94104-3204 to purchase training memberships for a twelve-month base period and four twelve-month optional periods in two non-profit organizations that support and promote world class, innovative, open source scientific computing projects.
<p>The sole source justification is based on the following: NIST's Material Measurement Laboratory's Office of Data and Informatics (ODI) is a premier, pioneering resource for researchers and institutions in the Materials Chemical, and Biological sciences who need to leverage both large and information-rich data sets now common in many disciplines. To continue its efforts to fulfill NIST's mission, ODI requires membership in professional organizations, specifically the Software Carpentry Foundation and Data Carpentry Organization, which aim to teach concepts, skills, and tools for working more effectively with data, and to help scientists be more productive by learning highly specialized computing skills. Membership into the Software Carpentry Foundation and Data Carpentry can only be obtained through Community Initiatives.</p>
<p>NIST had previously issued purchase order SB1341-17-SE-0061 to NumFOCUS Inc. for membership in these organizations. However, NIST was notified that, effective February 1, 2018, NumFOCUS has assigned all of its rights and obligations under the Agreement to Community Initiatives, a California nonproft public benefit corporation. NIST is electing to issue a new purchase order with Community Initiatives in lieu of exercising the next option period of SB1341-17-SE-0061 and incorporating a novation agreement into that contractual vehicle in the interest of efficiency in terms of the administrative burden.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NIST has determined that the expenditure in these professional memberships would further the authorized activities of the agency; and this determination is not affected by any incidental benefits that may accrue to individual employees.</p>
<p>The membership fulfills the following NIST requirements:<br />1.	Reservation of six (6) seats per year in an online instructor led training course.<br />2.	Ability for NIST to self-organize unlimited internal software workshops with no additional workshop fees.<br />3.	Organization of up to four (4) workshops at NIST Gaithersburg Campus, including: <br />&bull;	Coordinating with NIST to identify instructors with requisite skills/experience for workshop's subject matter. All instructors must be certified by either the Software Carpentry foundation or Data Carpentry Organization.<br />&bull;	Developing subject matter presentation content for the workshops.</p>
<p>Market research has shown that Community Initiatives, on behalf of the Software Carpentry Foundation and Data Carpentry, is the sole organization that can provide such membership, as they are the only professional organizations that support open source scientific computing, and promote sustainable high-level programming languages, open source code developments, and reproducible scientific research.</p>
<p>There is no other organization that provides the kind of instructional materials that Software Carpentry Foundation offers. They are deliberately operating-system and applications-program agnostic.  They focus on commonly used and mostly open source software tools such as Unix, Git and GitHub, Python, and R, though they also run workshops for users of SQL databases and MATLAB.  They bring a unique perspective to training of researchers that does not promote a particular vendor's software or hardware platform.  This approach is especially important for researchers at NIST, where staff utilize a wide variety of software and hardware configurations.  Similarly, Data Carpentry is a partner organization that focuses on training programs in data management, curation, visualization, and analytics.  Membership allows full access to all their resources.  Like Software Carpentry Foundation, Data Carpentry is operating-system and applications-program agnostic, which is a key requirement for NIST's researchers.</p>
<p>Given these facts, Community Initiatives is determined to be the only source reasonably available to provide the required membership and training.</p>
<p>The resulting purchase order will be a Firm Fixed Price order. The NAICS is 813920 with a size standard of $15 million.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested parties who regard themselves as capable of fulfilling these requirements are invited to submit responses to the Government for consideration. Responses received by 9 AM ET on 2/16/2018 will be considered by the Government.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government to no compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to issue a delivery order under a Basic Ordering Agreement for the Tomahawk Weapons System (TWS) Modernization program. This effort includes the design, development and integration of the Integrated Single Box Solution (ISBS) radio and upgraded antenna into the Tactical Tomahawk All-Up-Round (AUR) (herein referred to as TACTOM), as well as support for Advanced Weapon Communications Architecture (AWCA) test strategy. This effort encompasses the requirements definition and design for changes required to integrate a Government Furnished ISBS radio and antenna into the TACTOM missile up to and including AUR Critical Design Review. The effort shall also include the technical engineering support to the ISBS radio developer and AWCA network agency. In addition, the Contractor shall provide the continued engineering support for navigation system upgrades that allow the missile to successfully operate in a non-GPS environment. The communications and navigation upgraded TACTOM missile shall integrate with the Tomahawk Weapons System. For purposes of this effort, NAVAIR intends to award the effort to Raytheon Missile Systems, P.O. Box 11337, Bldg 9022, M/S K1, Tucson, AZ 85734-1337. Since 1998, Raytheon has been the sole developer, designer and manufacturer of the TACTOM missile and as such solely possesses the data rights to the current TACTOM configuration technical data package. Raytheon currently manages the key requirements, interfaces, and integration and verification documents for the TACTOM. AWCA will require extensive integration with TACTOM, which will require specific engineering data for the electrical, mechanical, firmware, software and functional interfaces. Raytheon is the only known source with the requisite knowledge capable of accomplishing this requirement within the required timeframe. This effort requires access to "Military Critical Technical Data" requiring a DD Form 1234, and the data associated with the Tomahawk missile is export controlled and not available to foreign sources or representatives.

The Contractor will furnish all material, supervision, tools, equipment, labor, transportation, subcontract management, project management and, upon mutual agreement, Initial Capital, to implement such projects as specified in individual Delivery Order.
 

NOTE:  The solicitation will not be made available on this website.
This notice is provided for information purposes only therefore FAR 5.203 does not apply.  This opportunity is available only to the utility company servicing Marine Corp Air Station Miramar, San Diego CA under a Utilities Energy Service Contract (UESC) N62473-13-G-1403, Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA), for the installation, replacement, renovation, repair, operation and maintenance of energy conservation measures and consuming equipment.  Services shall include but not be limited to upgrades to Facilities Management Systems (FMS), installation of energy management systems and direct digital controls, implementation of energy conservation measures, and limited Operations and Maintenance (O and M) services for any facilities within the service territory of Southern California.

Project Description:
MCAS Miramar UESC Phase I is energy conservation and resiliency project that includes replacement of Water Source Heat Pumps (WSHP) and Chilled Water Plant, replace Cooling Towers equipped with Variable Speed Fans to New High Efficiency Cooling towers also utilize the installations reclaimed water source to provide for water resiliency.
 Optimize Exterior Street Lighting by replacing/retrofitting existing lighting to Light Emitted Diode (LED) technology. Replace existing interior lighting with Light Emitted Diode (LED) technology or High Intensity Diode (HID) technology. Replace Air Cooled Chillers with New High Efficiency Chiller. Retrofit Air Cooled DX units to the Central Chilled Water Loop. Replace Reciprocating Air Cooled Chiller to a New High Efficiency Chiller. Replace 3-way Chilled Water Valves with 2-Way Water Valves with pump for lower loads. Convert Exhaust and Makeup Air Units to Variable Speed and optimize refrigeration equipment with EC motors, Controls and Curtains. Retrofit Filtration Pump with Variable Frequency Drives (VFD), and installation of vending misers.

System Reliability Pillar:
Water Source Heat Pumps (WSHP) - This ECM will upgrade and replace the current water source heat pumps at the Bachelors Enlisted Quarters (BEQ); Buildings 5702 and 5415.
  The current heat pumps are beyond their useful life and are unreliable.  The systems are currently coming offline frequently, and are very unreliable to the point of failure and require full system replacement.  This ECM will establish reliable and comfortable living conditions which are mandatory to ensure mission readiness for the enlisted Marines residing in the BEQs.  Not only will replacing the water source heat pumps provide a more energy efficient and reduce maintenance; it will directly increase the Marine Corps capability and reliability to perform mission essential tasks. 

Replacement of Critical Exterior Lighting Fixtures (Base wide)  This ECM replace existing High Pressure Sodium (HPS), Metal Halide Lamp (MHL), Compact Fluorescent Lamp (CFL), Halogen and Incandescent lighting fixtures.
  This ECM will increase the bases reliability and provide a safe operating condition for Marines to operate at night. The Street Lighting condition has degraded and is unacceptable, and considered a critical safety issue. This directly correlates to an increase in energy savings and reliability coupled with a large reduction in maintenance costs.

System Resilient Pillar:
Utilization of Reclaimed Water in Cooling Towers  
The ECM to replace the existing cooling towers will use an innovative strategy to use reclaimed water vice potable water in cooling towers will directly increase MCAS Miramars water resiliency. Replacement of cooling towers fixed with a closed water loop system that utilizes reclaimed water will reduce the bases demand for potable water and provide for a resilient standalone system.
 
System Efficiency Pillar:  
Replacement of Heating, Ventilation and Cooling (HVAC) Systems  The remaining ECMs to replace HVAC equipment described above, will directly reduce energy consumption and provide an increase in annual energy/cost savings and provide the Base more efficient HVAC equipment.
 
Replacement of Interior Lighting Systems  The ECMs to replace Interior Lighting systems described above directly will reduce energy consumption and provide an increase in annual energy/cost savings and provide the Base more efficient interior lighting systems.

<DESC>Execution of Industrial Base Modernization Projects at Government Owned Contractor Operated (GOCO) Facilities
<p>The U.S. Army, Army Contracting Command (ACC) New Jersey on behalf of the Office of the Project Director Joint Services (PD JS), located at Picatinny Arsenal, NJ is currently seeking interested sources for the execution of various modernization projects at multiple Government Owned Contractor Operated (GOCO) Army Ammunition Plant (AAP) facilities throughout the United States. <br />The objective of this initiative is to support the execution of modernization projects at various GOCO facilities throughout the U.S. The contractor shall have the ability to furnish all necessary services, personnel, labor, facilities, materials, supplies and equipment to meet the U.S. Government's modernization requirements. The contactor will have to execute each modernization project in coordination with the Operating Contractor at the corresponding GOCO facility.</p>
<p>The modernization projects to be executed under this effort are designed to increase, explosives, propellants, metal parts, load assemble and pack (LAP) of small, medium and large caliber ammunition production/manufacturing readiness to meet current and future requirements, ensure safety and environmental compliance, reduce operating costs and footprint, improve quality and promote efficiency, and improve quality of work environment (QWE) within the GOCO ammunition facilities. The projects range from low dollar to high multi-million dollar efforts, and include projects such as infrastructure repairs as well as major production line replacements. <br />This effort would provide the U.S. Army with the ability to execute the GOCO modernization projects by select firms with a core competency in specific areas of facility modernization. Modernization refers to the alteration or replacement of facilities solely to implement new or higher standards, to accommodate new functions, or to replace building components, such as framework, foundations, and /or infrastructure, that have outlived their efficient and effective life expectancy. The U.S. Army is seeking firms specializing in disciplines, such as environmental remediation, infrastructure repair, energy generation, and energy distribution. Respondents with the breadth of engineering expertise for all such modernization projects would greatly increase the probability of the successful vendor meeting project cost, schedule and performance requirements. The U.S. Government's intent is to find innovative solutions to future, complex modernization problems. <br />The modernization projects are expected to be executed at a number of U.S. Army facilities to include the following AAP's. Primary areas of ammunition expertise at each facility are listed. <br />&bull; Radford AAP (gun propellants and nitrocellulose), Radford, VA<br />&bull; Iowa AAP (load, assemble and pack of ammunition (L/A/P)), Burlington, IA <br />&bull; Milan AAP (L/A/P), Milan, TN<br />&bull; Holston AAP (explosives), Kingsport, TN<br />&bull; Lake City AAP (small caliber ammunition), Independence, MO<br />&bull; Scranton AAP (large caliber metal parts), Scranton, PA</p>
<p>Potential Performance Requirements for this effort include the following topic areas:</p>
<p>&bull; General Engineering Support <br />&bull; Engineering Design<br />&bull; Environmental Support <br />&bull; Equipment upgrade/modification <br />&bull; Facility upgrade and Transition to the Operating Contractor<br />&bull; Debris removal/disposition<br />&bull; Training</p>
<p>Prospective contractor would be responsible for compliance with all Federal, State, and Local laws, as well as Army regulations and policies.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 541330 and 236210.</p>
<p>The purpose of this notice is to obtain information from firms/companies to assist in the market research to determine the most suitable approach to meet the U.S. Government needs and industry capabilities in this area.

<DESC>Synopsis:
<p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY and a Request for Industry Comment is for informational and planning purposes only and SHALL NOT be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Mission and Installation Contracting Command, Fort Bragg (MICC-FB). The intent of this Sources Sought is to gather data on the current market's industry base and to allow potential interested contractors an opportunity to provide their capability statements along with other pertinent data (see questions below) about their company in order to help our organization better analyze the pool of qualified small business firms, relative to the North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) 493110, "General Warehousing and Storage," with small business size standard of $27,500,000.00. Responses to this Sources Sought ARE NOT OFFERS and SHALL NOT BE accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Contractors are reminded that only Contracting Officers are authorized to commit the Government to the obligation of funds. A formal Solicitation DOES NOT exist at this time.</p>
<p>MICC-FB received a request for a services follow-on contract for the management of the Unaccompanied Personnel Housing (UPH) Furniture Management Program. The contractor would perform on site quality inspections of UPH furniture; classify furniture, be responsible for coordinating with customers for delivery and issue of UPH furniture, provide receiving reports to the Furniture Management Office (FMO), perform simple furniture repairs, and assemble/disassemble furniture. The contractor would maintain the life cycle replacement data base on all UPH Furniture, provide furniture storage operation, perform furniture inventories; redistribute furniture, turn-in furniture to DRMO, receive, store, issue, and make direct exchange of used and/or new furniture, warehouse installation property including barracks furniture as directed. The conceptual acquisition strategy is to establish a single contract consisting of a 12-month base period that includes a thirty day phase-in and four 12-month options which includes a thirty day phase-out. The Government's intent is to have the contractor submit invoices monthly via Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) for services provided and received on one (1) contract line item number (CLIN) each month at a fixed rate per month and provide contract manpower reporting at a flat rate per year or at no additional price on a separate CLIN. In accordance with (IAW) FAR Clause 52.217-9, the Government reserves the right to exercise options for a total anticipated period of performance of 60 months with a possibility of extending IAW FAR 52.217-8 up to an additional 6 months if deemed necessary. The purpose of this Sources Sought is to seek capability statements from interested small businesses in order to reaffirm the initial market research. Responses to this Sources Sought from Large Businesses are not required at this time.</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR TECHNICAL OR COST/PRICE PROPOSALS. The Government will not award a contract based on this Sources Sought nor reimburse participants for information provided. This is a request for small businesses interested in serving as prime contractors to submit a brief capability statement demonstrating how they could potentially meet the requirements briefly described herein.

<CONTACT>Scott, Jacqueline
<DESC>Information Technology, Development of Extensible, Modular-Based Platform, Mineral and Land Records System (MLRS)

Purpose:  

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Washington Office, in coordination with the National Operation Center, Lakewood, Colorado is conducting market research to solidify the acquisition approach for the titled project.  The submitted information will also help us to assess interest in the MLRS project and to determine the capabilities of those firms (solution providers) interested in the project.  The responses to this Request for Information (RFI) will not be used (and is not intended) to include or exclude any firms from a competition process.  However, the information provided will help us determine the best viable approach such as a set-aside (i.e. small business, WO, SDVOSB, HubZone etc.) and/or GSA versus posting on the open market (FBO.gov, FedConnect.net).  

"An RFI submission must provide capabilities information which will allow BLM to evaluate the validity of sources.  It is not enough to simply express interest or provide generic marketing information if you are intending to demonstrate your capability to provide this type of service."

The complete RFI package consists of this document (140L0118R0004 RFI easy read.pdf) and the following:

Attachments (visit FedConnect.net for related attachments):

1. BLM RequestforInformation.pdf, dated 1 February 2018, Version 1, 6 Pages  
2. 140L0118R0004 Corporate Overview.xls ( Editable Excel File, 1 Sheet)
3. 140L0118R0004 Performance Information.doc (Editable Word Document)
4. 140L0118R0004 Questions and Answers.doc (Editable Word Document)

APPENDIX A, BLM Supporting Documentation - Project Attachments for Referencing (DRAFT Watermark):

1. MLRS, Concept of Operation, Version 1.0, Dated 31 August 2017, 72 Pages
2. Service Design Package, Version 1.0, Dated 31 August 2017, 212 Pages
3. Capabilities Matrix_V_7 (Protected Excel File, 2 Sheets)

This RFI consists of four (4) parts.  Part III has eight (8) questions.  Each question requires a narrative response.  Depending on the firm and whether the information is readily available, it is estimated that the RFI will take between 4-8 hours to complete.  This excludes the review of APPENDIX A, BLM Supporting Documentation.

- Part I: Solution Provider Corporate Overview (Page Limitation, None)
- Part II: Historical Performance Information (Page Limitation, 1 Page)
- Part III: MLRS Questions and Answers (Page Limitation, 3 Pages)
- Part IV:  Optional Additional Information (Page Limitation, None)

Your firm's honest input is greatly appreciated and would help us achieve the best possible outcome!  

Background/Project Overview:

"The Mineral and Land Records System (MLRS) holistic vision is to implement new and improved user-requested functionality built on a system architecture leveraging proven modern technologies to support mineral and land record management for the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). The system architecture will be the foundational platform for developing the capabilities needed to meet the business and technical requirements of MLRS.   It will be implemented within a system architecture that will directly support key goals of the BLM Executive Strategic Vision and Work Plan for Information Technology."

"The BLM's mineral and land records business processes and information play a critical role in addressing challenges posed by land and resource management. The information managed by MLRS is critical today, and will only grow in importance in the future, providing support for the BLM's land and resource management planning and operations. The Nation's demand for federal land management of increased recreational and commercial resource use, or landscape-level analysis is expected to become more complex and multi-faceted. These complexities come in the form of physical records, access to information, technology enablers, regulations and legacy knowledge walking out the door.  Information is key and access to it is becoming essential to make decisions at all levels of government.  MLRS information and records are the foundation for addressing these challenges. The MLRS investment will support the challenges posed by its land management mission by reducing BLMs operational costs, enhancing workforce productivity, improving the quality of its lands and minerals information and records, while providing a more valuable customer experience. The MLRS will:

- Standardize business processes and give flexibility for localization needs,
- Codify business rules (Regulations, Handbooks, Manuals, and Instruction Memoranda) as a maintainable knowledge base for driving workflows and decisions,
- Capture the expertise of its aging and shrinking workforce and make it simple and appealing to the next generation of users,
- Enable the BLM to use its land and records case processing expertise seamlessly across the organization as demand increases or workforce diminishes,
- Capture and manage workforce utilization for applications, operations, planning, and tracking Program Element (used by BLM to record the cost of work activities) accomplishments,
- Provide reliable real-time case and land status information for the BLM enterprise as information reports or maps.
- Enhance the defensibility of its adjudicative decisions,
- Provide a platform for extending MLRS functionality to aid in solving other land and mineral related business needs, and
- Support the business needs of BLM programs by identifying the interest held in cases to subsurface depths."

Section 508, NARA, and security and other regulatory compliance are required.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a sources sought synopsis only. The purpose of this synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classification (Hubzone, 8(a), small, small disadvantage, service disabled veteran owned small business, etc.) relative to NAICS 621999, All Other Miscellaneous Ambulatory Health Care Services (size standard of $15 Million). Responses to this synopsis will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. After review of the responses to this sources sought synopsis, a solicitation announcement may be published on the FedBizOpps website. Responses to this sources sought synopsis are not considered adequate responses to the solicitation announcement. All interested offerors will have to respond to the solicitation announcement in addition to responding to this sources sought. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis or any follow up information requests.
<p>The Florida National Guard, Office of the State Surgeon, is seeking potential sources and feedback capable of performing all functions within the "Draft" Statement of Work for Occupational Medical Surveillance Examination Services. Performance will take place in various locations throughout Florida during a two (2) week period.</p>
<p>Contractors with the expertise to successfully perform the requirements outlined in the "Draft" Performance Work Statement attached are encouraged to submit a capability statement.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to consider a small business set-aside based upon responses hereto for any subsequent action. All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be awarded a DOD contract and with their local SBA office. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform at least 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14.</p>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS:</p>
<p>1. The information below provides a "Contractor Capability Survey" to allow you to document your company's capabilities in meeting these requirements.</p>
<p>2. If, after reviewing these documents, you desire to participate in the market research, please complete and return the Contractor Capability Survey below. Response format and due date information is specified at the bottom portion of this notice. Failure to provide a complete response may result in the government being unable to adequately assess your capabilities. If you lack sufficient experience in a particular area, please provide details explaining how you would overcome the lack of experience/capabilities in order to perform that portion of the requirement (i.e., teaming, subcontracting, etc.)</p>
<p>3. This sources sought inquiry is for all potential vendors.</p>
<p>Questions relative to this market survey should be addressed via email to Jeff Moore, at Jeffrey.d.moore14.mil@mail.mil</p>
<p>Part I. Sources Sought:<br />Please provide the following business information for your firm in the following format:</p>
<p>Vendor Name/ Cage Code/ Point of Contact: Socio-Economic Status/ GSA Contract # Capability<br />[ABC, Inc]<br />Cage:[1FAK4]<br />Name:[John Smith]<br />Phone: [(555)123-4567]<br />Email: [john.smith@abcinc.com]<br />URL: www.abcinc.com<br />1. [Small Business] <br />2. [8(a) Certified]<br />3. [SDVOSB]<br />4. [WOSB]<br />5. [GSA Contract # GS-XX-XXXXX] [Provides all required services with consistent superior past performance ratings.]</p>
<p>Please also indicate:</p>
<p>If your company has experience providing the services anticipated in the attached PWS.</p>
<p>Whether your company has recent sales history to commercial companies.</p>
<p>Whether your company has a contract under a Federal Supply Schedule that would address all required services. If so, please provide the relevant GSA contract number.</p>
<p>Attention: Small business respondents who are interested in submitting a proposal as the prime contractor for this effort. The acquisition strategy for this requirement has not been decided; however, the Florida Army National Guard is contemplating setting this acquisition aside for small businesses if there is sufficient demonstrated interest and capability. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that two or more small business prime contractors must be capable of providing at least 50% of the entire scope of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting. Provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc. If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided.</p>
<p>Part II. Request for Information: If possible, please provide answers to the following questions.</p>
<p>1. Are there specific requirements in the documentation that has the effect of limiting competition among potential vendors?</p>
<p>2. Is there an alternate NAICS that you believe is more appropriate for this requirement? If so, what is the NAICS and why?</p>
<p>3. Is there anything in the PWS that has the effect of creating duplicative of unnecessary costs to the Government? Do you have any additional comments on the PWS?</p>
<p>4. Based on your experience, are the requested services commercial in nature as defined by FAR 2.101? If so, why, and are there established catalog or market prices for these services?</p>
<p>CAPABILITIES PACKAGE:</p>
<p>All interested firms shall submit a response demonstrating their capabilities to provide the requested items to the primary point of contact listed below. Any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought synopsis is voluntary. As stipulated in Federal Acquisition Regulation 15.201, responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

The Government will not reimburse any costs incurred or associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely within the Government's discretion.</p>
<p>The Government's assessment of the capability statements received will factor into whether any forthcoming solicitation will be solicited as full and open or set-aside for small business, or any particular small business program (e.g. SDVOSB, EDWOSB, HUBZone, 8(a), etc.).</p>
<p>Be advised that all correspondence sent via e-mail shall contain a subject line that reads "Sources Sought - FLARNG Medical Monitoring Services." Attachments with files ending in.zip or .exe are not allowable and files will be stripped and deleted from any emails received by the Government.

<DESC><strong>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE <br />NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH<br />NATIONAL CENTER FOR ADVANCING TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCES<br />(NCATS) </strong>
<p><strong>1.	Solicitation Number</strong>:	 NIHDA201800051</p>
<p><strong>2.	Title</strong>:  Promega Reagent Kits and Assays</p>
<p><strong>3.	Classification Code</strong>:  6550</p>
<p><strong>4.	NAICS Code</strong>:  325414</p>
<p><strong>5.	Description</strong>:</p>
<p>This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement.</p>
<p>This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition.  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes.  No award will be made as a result of this notice.  The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice.  This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p><strong>6. Purpose and Objectives:</strong></p>
<p>Promega manufactures a number of reagent systems NCATS uses in multiple ongoing assays and projects. The assay systems and kits allow us to measure specific outcomes of cells. Promega products are specifically engineered for high throughput and automation settings of the type used at NCATS.</p>
<p><strong>7. Project requirements:</strong><br /><br />See the attached Sources Sought document for specific product names and quantitites.</p>
<p><strong>8. Anticipated period of performance:</strong> One-time delivery to ship 30 days after receipt of order.</p>
<p><strong>9. Other important considerations:</strong> This is a brand name-only requirement. Promega brand reagents are in use in ongoing assays and projects. Substitution of other brand products will invalidate the ongoing work, thereby imposing immense costs and time delays on the Government.</p>
<p><strong>10. Cabability statement /information sought.</strong></p>
<p>Responses to this notice must include sufficient information to establish the interested parties' bona-fide capabilities of providing the product or service.  The response shall include: the unit price, list price, shipping and handling costs, delivery days after contract award, delivery terms, prompt payment discount terms, F.O.B. Point (Destination or Origin), product or catalog number(s); product description; and any other information or factors that may be considered in the award decision.  Such factors may include: past performance; special features required for effective program performance; trade-in considerations; probable life of the item selected as compared with that of a comparable item; warranty considerations; maintenance availability; and environmental and energy efficiency considerations.</p>
<p>Respondents must also provide their  DUNS number, organization name, address, point of contact, and size and type of business (e.g., 8(a), HubZone, etc., pursuant to the applicable NAICS code and any other information that may be helpful in developing or finalizing the acquisition requirements.</p>
<p>All responses to this notice must be submitted electronically to the Contract Specialist and Contracting Officer.  Facsimile responses are NOT accepted.</p>
<p>This Notice is posted by the Office of Acquisitions, National Institute on Drug Abuse, NCATS Section. The response must be submitted to Stuart Kern, Contract Specialist, stuart.kern@nih.gov.</p>
<p>The response must be received on or before 11 a.m. Eastern time, Monday, February 12, 2018.</p>
<p><strong>11. Disclaimer and Important Notes:</strong> This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the organization's qualifications to perform the work.</p>
<p>Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted. After a review of the responses received, a presolicitation synopsis and solicitation may be published in Federal Business Opportunities. However, responses to this notice will not be considered adequate responses to a solicitation.</p>
<p><strong>12. Confidentiality:</strong> No proprietary, classified, confidential, or sensitive information should be included in your response. The Government reserves the right to use any non-proprietary technical information in any resultant solicitation(s).</p>

<p>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), in support of PMA-261 CH-53 Heavy Lift Helicopter Program Office, announces its intention to procure: CH-53K Tie Down Rings.</p>

<p><br />PROGRAM BACKGROUND<br />The original CH-53K cargo floor was made from thermoplastic material, and due to the position of the tie down rings in the floor, the cargo strap hooks would damage the floor. The several tie down rings were replaced with an extended tie down rings to resolve the problem. The Tactical Bulk Fuel Delivery System (TBFDS) was designed for use with the original cargo floor tie down rings in order to meet the 20/20/10 crash load requirements of the restraint system. Reverting to the original tie down rings is no longer an issue since the CH-53K cargo floor is now made of aluminum. The extended rings also presented a potential dual point of failure because they utilize two axis pins versus one axis pin on the original tie down ring. Use of the original tie down ring eliminates one axis pin and one of the potential points of failure. The Government desires to obtain the original tie down rings for the modification of two (2) Engineering Design Model (EDM), six (6) System Demonstration Test Article (SDTA), and two (2) Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) United States Marine Corps CH-53K Heavy Lift Helicopters.<br />ELIGIBILITY<br />The applicable NAICS code for this requirement is 336413 with a Small Business Size Standard of 1,000.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 3.0pt; line-height: normal;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN;" lang="EN">Auditory Blast Injury Prevention Standards Request for Information</span></strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN;" lang="EN"> <br /> <br /> This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC), headquartered at Fort Detrick, Maryland. The USAMRMC mission is to provide medical knowledge and materiel lifecycle management to protect, treat, and optimize Warfighter health and performance across the full spectrum of operations. The Department of Defense (DoD) Blast Injury Research Program Coordinating Office (PCO) manages the DoD blast injury research investment, on behalf of the Executive Agent (EA), to ensure critical knowledge gaps are filled, avoid costly and unnecessary duplication of effort, and accelerate the fielding of prevention and treatment strategies by leveraging existing knowledge and fostering collaboration and information sharing among the world's blast injury experts. The PCO advises the EA on Military Health System (MHS) Blast Injury Prevention and Treatment Standards to recommend to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs [OASD(HA)]. To identify the best available standards that will meet the needs of the DoD, the PCO, in collaboration The MITRE Corporation, employs the MHS Blast Injury Prevention Standards Recommendation (BIPSR) Process. The BIPSR Process is designed to address the needs of all Services for biomedically valid Blast Injury Prevention Standards to protect against the entire spectrum of blast injuries. The process provides an unbiased, stakeholder-driven critical assessment methodology for identifying the best biomedically valid candidate MHS Blast Injury Prevention Standards currently available. It supports the development and testing of safe weapons and effective combat platform crew and individual protection systems. It is important to note that the BIPSR Process is not a research program and does not develop new injury criteria or injury prediction tools. However, it does inform research by identifying gaps where no suitable standards currently exist. <br /> <br /> The term &ldquo;Military Health System (MHS) Blast Injury Prevention Standard&rdquo; is defined as a &ldquo;biomedically valid description of physiologically or biomechanically based injury and performance responses of a human to blast insults.&rdquo; The standards can range from simple dose response curves and injury thresholds that address single components of blast insults, </span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN;" lang="EN">such as blast pressure wave magnitude, or address multiple components of blast insults, such as pressure magnitude over time</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN;" lang="EN">. These standards will play a critical role in the prevention of Warfighter injuries and the enhancement of Warfighter survivability by informing health hazard assessments, survivability assessments, and protection system development aimed at producing safe weapon systems, survivable combat platforms, and effective protection systems. To conduct these assessments, the DoD needs MHS Blast Injury Prevention Standards to investigate the physiological and biomechanical effects of blast injuries on the Warfighter, both when generated by enemy </span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN;" lang="EN">weapons systems and during weapon systems firing</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN;" lang="EN">. <br /> <br /> For the purposes of this RFI, Blast Injury is defined as an injury that occurs as the result of </span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN;" lang="EN">detonation of high explosives, impulse exposure including small and large caliber arms fire, vehicle-borne and or person- borne weapon systems, rocket-propelled grenades, and improvised explosive devices</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN;" lang="EN">. The taxonomy of injuries from blast explosive devices is: (a) Primary: Blast overpressure injury resulting in direct tissue damage from the shock wave coupling into the body; (b) Secondary: Injury produced by primary fragments originating from the exploding device (preformed and natural (unformed) casing fragments, and other projectiles deliberately introduced into the device to enhance the fragment threat); and secondary fragments, which are projectiles from the environment (debris, vehicular metal, etc.); (c) Tertiary: Displacement of the body or part of the body by the blast overpressure causing acceleration/deceleration to the body or its parts, which may subsequently strike hard objects and suffer typical blunt injury (translational injury), avulsion (separation) of limbs, stripping of soft tissues, skin speckling with explosive product residue, and building structural collapse that results in crush and blunt injuries or crush syndrome development; (d) Quaternary: Other &lsquo;explosive products&lsquo; effects - heat (radiant and convective) and toxic (toxidromes from fuel, metals, etc.) - causing burn and inhalation injury; (e) Quinary: Clinical consequences of &lsquo; post-detonation environmental contaminants &lsquo;including bacteria (deliberate and commensal, with or without sepsis), radiation (dirty bombs), tissue reactions to fuel, metals, etc. Stakeholders have identified 14 blast injury types: Lower Extremity, Spine/Back, Upper Extremity, Dermal Burns, Moderate to Severe Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Pelvic/Urogenital, Neck, Face, Abdomen, Thorax, Skull Fracture, Ocular, Auditory, and Mild TBI. <br /> <br /> The BIPSR Process currently focuses on Human Auditory Blast Injury Prevention Standards. Impulse noise related auditory injury includes symptoms such as tinnitus and hearing threshold shift, and physical changes to ear structure or performance, such as tympanic membrane rupture, disruption of the bones of the middle ear, and reduced auditory evoked potentials. Potential operational environments and intended uses of human Auditory Blast Injury Prevention Standards may include the protection of military service members who are exposed to various levels of impulsive noise from weapons fire or explosives, continuous noise from vehicle operation, and the combination of continuous and impulsive noise exposure. The BIPSR Process identified a need to define injury criteria and test methods to establish thresholds for protective systems designed to protect the hearing of military service members from all blast injury categories and types in their respective operational environments. This RFI seeks to: </span></p>

Requirement

The VISN 12 Network is responsible for providing health care to Veterans throughout the upper Midwest region. VISN 12 is a health care system that includes 9 Medical Centers, and 40+ Community Based Outpatient Clinics, all working together to provide efficient, accessible health care to Veterans in their areas. 
Like all health care facilities, VISN 12 faces numerous clinical and business challenges, including inventorying, monitoring and distributing high-level disinfected (HLD) and sterilized reusable medical equipment (RME). These challenges can be met through the implementation of a Sterile Processing Inventory and Workflow Management Solution. In doing so, VISN 12 plans to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of patient care, with reductions in staff hours spent searching for medical, surgical, and dental devices while maintaining more efficient (i.e. less expensive, utilization tailored) inventory levels. VISN 12 intends to implement a Sterile Processing Inventory and Workflow Management Solution as a means of achieving the aforementioned benefits.
This requirement establishes for Contractor provided solutions for the Sterile Processing Inventory and Workflow Management Solution implementation in VISN 12. The Contractor shall provide a fully integrated, seamless, turnkey solution encompassing hardware, software, and incidental services to VISN 12 facilities comprising this contract

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /><br />Background:<br /></span>CCQDER was established as a resource for the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and other Federal statistical agencies to develop and test survey questionnaires. Various methods are used evaluate questions including: cognitive interviewing, focus groups, and usability testing. Respondents are recruited to participate in an hour or 1 &frac12; hour cognitive interview/focus group. Cognitive interviews and focus groups are audio or video recorded to allow researchers to review not only the transcript of the interaction, but also the behaviors and body language of the respondents. CCQDER employs a specific methodology supported by an integrated system. This system consists of commercial off-the-shelf video, database and other software, as well as a custom developed application. The video software operates independently; however, the custom application (Q-Notes Plus) is the main interface with CCQDER researchers. It utilizes specifically selected embedded video retrieved from the video system. CCQDER purchased Virage video capture software, streaming video software, and manual video tagging (indexing of database) software in 2003. Virage software was later acquired by Autonomy, and subsequently Hewlett Packard. CCQDER upgraded to the Autonomy software in 2011. The software version CCQDER currently has installed has been brought to EOL (End of Life).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Requirements (Partial Requirements or Key Requirements):<br /></span>I. Tagging requirements (video database indexing)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Ability to create and view segments of an interview video as an independent video file. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Ability to search and view a segment of an interview video that is related to other segments. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Ability to find multiple segments of an interview video.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Capability to play a segment of an interview and have that segment automatically stop playing at the next different segment - a stop feature. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Edit feature for interview video segment selection on playback w/ appropriate time stamp.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) NOTICE:
This is NOT a request for pricing or a proposal.
The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has a requirement for Regulated Medical Waste removal service for nine (9) locations for the VA Tennessee Valley Healthcare System (TVHS).  The Performance Work Statement (PWS) is provided. The NAICS code is 562112 and the small business size standard for this procurement is $38.5 million.  
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines RMW as "any solid waste that is generated in the diagnosis, treatment, or immunization of human beings or animals, in research pertaining thereto, or in the production or testing of biologicals."  This may include any waste material or article which harbors, or may reasonably be considered to harbor, pathogens which might be expected to produce disease in healthy individuals.  Medical waste subject to these requirements includes waste that generally has been considered infectious or potentially infectious by the health care community, as well as waste originating from health care or research facilities that are aesthetically objectionable and thus, problematic when disposed of improperly.  "Trace" chemotherapeutic waste shall be included in the scope of this contract. "Bulk" chemotherapeutic waste shall be managed as hazardous waste within the generating facility and disposed of through a separate contract.
NEW RECYCLING EFFORTS
One of TVHS s top priorities is the minimization of waste to include significant efforts in recycling and waste diversion.  The requested services will render all RMW, chemotherapeutic and pathological waste non-recognizable and non-infectious.  It is preferable that resulting waste be sent for disposal as fuel in electrical co-generation and/or as much of the waste be recycled as possible (e.g. plastic, metal, etc.).  Waste may be incinerated in lieu of co-generation but resulting ash placed in a landfill should be reduced to about 7-10% of the original weight of waste.  
The VA is requesting comments from waste industry contractors on the provided PWS.  
Comments should include a general dollar magnitude of effort for requested services.  
PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The anticipated period of performance for this procurement will be for a Base Year plus four (4) option years that may be exercised at the discretion of the Government.
All data contained in the PWS herein is for information only and is subject to change. The data is for general purposes ONLY and SHALL NOT be used in preparation of any offer to the Government.
Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response. The Government does not intend to award a contract based on this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI. Please send all written responses via email to:  Lori.Krohn@va.gov. 
 
PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT (PWS)
REGULATED MEDICAL WASTE (RMW) SERVICES

GENERAL
Contractor shall provide complete removal, disposal and transportation of all Regulated medical Waste (RMW) for the VA Tennessee Valley Healthcare System (TVHS).  The Contractor shall furnish all personnel, materials, tools and equipment necessary to perform the task in accordance with the schedule and to comply with all guidelines established by Federal, State and local laws and ordinances.  
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines RMW as "any solid waste that is generated in the diagnosis, treatment, or immunization of human beings or animals, in research pertaining thereto, or in the production or testing of biologicals."  This may include any waste material or article which harbors, or may reasonably be considered to harbor, pathogens which might be expected to produce disease in healthy individuals.  Medical waste subject to these requirements includes waste that generally has been considered infectious or potentially infectious by the health care community, as well as waste originating from health care or research facilities that are aesthetically objectionable and thus, problematic when disposed of improperly.  "Trace" chemotherapeutic waste shall be included in the scope of this contract. "Bulk" chemotherapeutic waste shall be managed as hazardous waste within the generating facility and disposed of through a separate contract.
NEW RECYCLING EFFORTS
One of TVHS s top priorities is the minimization of waste to include significant efforts in recycling and waste diversion.  It is highly encouraged that prospective offerors give significant consideration to recycling and diversion efforts as part of their submittal.  The requested services will render all RMW, chemotherapeutic and pathological waste non-recognizable and non-infectious.  It is preferable that resulting waste be sent for disposal as fuel in electrical co-generation and/or as much of the waste be recycled as possible (e.g. plastic, metal, etc.).  Waste may be incinerated in lieu of co-generation but resulting ash placed in a landfill should be reduced to about 7-10% of the original weight of waste.  Submittals that simply identify treated waste as being sent to a landfill may not be considered.
REGULATED MEDICAL WASTE (RMW) REQUIREMENTS
Contractor to provide collection containers that are reusable, sealable, leak proof and puncture resistant with secure lids that can be used at point-of-generation collections/stations throughout TVHS facilities.  In FY16, TVHS generated approximately 343,000 pounds of medical waste at the Nashville Campus and 82,000 pounds of medical waste at the Alvin C. York Campus in Murfreesboro.  The weight of waste at outpatient clinics is nominal.
The contractor shall adhere to the following regulations. Regulations stated should only be used as a guide and are not intended to be all-inclusive regulations that the contractor must comply with.
The contractor shall submit all state department and public reports as required.
Pursuant to codes of the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC), Division of Solid Waste Management.
The contractor must comply with executive order 13101 (SEPTEMBER 14, 1998) GREENING THE GOVERNMENT THROUGH WASTE PREVENTION, RECYCLING AND FEDERAL ACQUISITION.
The contractor shall utilize an on-line manifest system to log receipt for materials and certify proper disposal and that is compatible with current VA computer systems. The contractor will submit the proposed manifest system forms for VA approval. After approval of the online system and award of the contract, the Contractor will furnish login information to the Contracting Officer Representative (COR) to access the online manifest system.  The contractor will leave one copy of the manifest with the COR at the time of the pick-up showing the quantity picked up. The completed manifests will be returned within Thirty (30) days to the COR. Manifest shall contain at minimum the signature, address and contact information of (1) generator, (2) transporter and (3) final destruction/disposal representative.
Plant must comply with the Clean Air Act of 1991 and produce only safe neutral by-products and the vendor must be able to show compliance with all environmental applicable state and county regulations.
The COR or designee will verify weights/counts of materials being picked up. 
The contractor is responsible for notifying the COR or designee upon arrival and departure at all pick-up locations.
The following is a listing and description of the medical wastes that are, at a minimum, included in the scope of this contract:
Cultures and stocks: Cultures and stocks of infectious agents and associated biologicals, including: cultures from medical and pathological laboratories; cultures and stocks of infectious agents from research and industrial laboratories; wastes from the production of biologicals; discarded live and attenuated vaccines, and culture dishes and devices used to transfer inoculate and mix cultures.
Pathological Waste: Human pathological wastes, including tissues, organs and body parts and body fluids that are removed during surgery or autopsy, or other medical procedures, and specimens of body fluids and their containers. Animal tissues, body parts and carcasses are included in this category. Excluded in this category are tissue samples in paraffin.

<DESC>PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT
MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE (MSW) & RECYCLING SERVICES


BACKGROUND

VA Tennessee Valley Healthcare System (TVHS) is an integrated healthcare system comprised of two Medical Centers: the Alvin C. York Campus in Murfreesboro, TN, the Nashville Campus in Nashville, TN, andmany community based outpatient clinics and other facilities located in Tennessee and Kentucky.
TVHS provides ambulatory care, primary care, and secondary care in acute medicine and surgery, specialized tertiary care, transplant services, spinal cord injury, outpatient care, and a full range of extended care and mental health services.The Nashville Campus is the only VA facility that supports all solid organ transplant programs, including total in-house kidney and bone marrow transplants. The Alvin C. York Campus is a network referral center for mental health services, geriatrics, and extended care. TVHS provides a full range of specialized medical services.
TVHS has a mandated goal to achieve a 50% or greater recycling rate across the healthcare system.  Currently, at the conclusion of FY17, TVHS has a diversion rate of approximately 33.9%.  As such, TVHS is looking for service providers who can help assist in obtaining this goal of 50%.  Offerors will be afforded the opportunity to participate in a site visit of the two main campuses to observe current waste management and recycling practices.  It is the VA s intent to allow each offeror to develop and submit a Recycling Plan that will help the VA manage waste in the most efficient, economical and best way possible to obtain a 50% or greater recycling/diversion rate by the end of the 2nd Option Period of the contract.   A general overview of how the offeror intends to help the VA accomplish their 50% goal is expected with the offer.  The awardee will conduct an independent study of the VAs current recycling practices and accounting and will provide the plan to the COR for approval.
SOLID WASTE & RECYCYCLABLES REMOVAL

The Contractor shall furnish all labor, materials, equipment, and expertise necessary to perform waste removal and recycling services consisting of municipal solid waste (MSW) and recycling of numerous materials including but not limited to cardboard, metal, plastic, wood, yard waste, food waste, solid fill, and construction debris typical of healthcare, institutional, and office occupancy excluding regulated medical waste, pathological, anti-neoplastic (chemotherapeutic) waste,  and hazardous wastes for TVHS..   Offerors should be aware that there is always a potential for inappropriate hazardous waste in any solid waste stream.  Training and programs implemented by the awardee and the VA should prevent or reduce any such potential. 
The Contractor shall provide all equipment to include roll-offs, tip dumpsters, compactor units, guide rails, collection units, etc. to accomplish proper MSW and recycling removal.
The Contractor shall provide all labor for segregating recyclable materials from MSW that ends up in the roll-offs, dumpsters, etc. to ensure all potentially recyclable materials are segregated, recycled, and diverted from landfills.  This applies to readily available items identified in the dumpsters.  For example, the Contractor identifies large pieces of metal or a wooden desk in a dumpster.  It is expected the Contractor will extricate the recyclable materials and place them in the appropriate recycling stream.  The Contractor is not expected to open bags of trash to find recyclable materials.

The VA reserves the right to require waste removal on days other than or in addition to those indicated in the pricing schedule, on Sundays, and holidays at the rates specified in the pricing schedule.

The contractor shall remove and dispose of waste in a manner that shall not create or cause conditions detrimental to public health or that constitute a public nuisance. The contractor maintains full responsibility for compliance with all federal, state and local laws governing removal of waste materials. Special emphasis needs to be placed on ensuring that the loads removed are covered and secured in such a manner as to prevent accidental spillage during transport.

TVHS is aggressively targeting the reduction of waste generated by the healthcare system.  It is preferred that any waste that cannot be recycled, diverted or donated be sent in whole or in part for waste-to-fuel, cogeneration, or incineration.   Offerors are highly encouraged to propose a greener solution where unrecyclable waste is either used for fuel or sent for incineration (resultant ash should be about 7-10% of the original weight of waste) and kept out of the landfill.  TVHS shall decide based on the proposal and cost what is feasible and in the best interest of the community and Government.

The contractor shall dispose of metal, wood, cardboard, plastic, construction debris, solid fill, yard waste and all such other waste that is capable of being recycled in such a manner that the items are in fact recycled.  Certificates of Recycling or an equivalent demonstrating that the material has been recycled shall be provided to TVHS within 30 days of processing materials.  

Noise Ordinance. No pickups will be made at any campus during noise reduction periods as set for the by the town/city in which the facility is being serviced.  The Contractor is responsible for researching this requirement for each municipality it provides services to TVHS and adhering to the established ordinances.  

At the time of the service the contractor shall recover and remove any debris, trash, or waste on VA grounds around container regardless of how it got there. The contractor shall also pick up and dispose of any visible waste material after pulling the containers away from the building before leaving the property.  

Internal recycling bins will be provided by the offeror or the VA depending on the waste and recycling plan presented by the offeror.   All internal recycling bins used at all facilities will be taken to a central collection location by the VA.

Any equipment provided by the Contractor shall be compatible with existing TVHS equipment and electrical connections. TVHS shall provide AC current to the equipment.

Some containers may be designated to receive  On Call  services. This refers to waste containers that are used intermittently and not filled on a regular basis. For example, a recycling container used for yard waste will be serviced differently throughout the year. During summer and fall months there may be increased usage of this container. At any time during the year, there may be damage that is caused by weather that may require increased usage of this container (e.g. after storm cleanup). Containers designated as  On Call  indicates the COR or other authorized representatives of TVHS will contact the vendor to request emptying of this container. On Call is defined as the VA will call when services is needed.

The Contractor will work with TVHS personnel to develop a comprehensive recycling plan for the identified sites.  The Recycling Plan shall include at a minimum the following:  

Identification of specific waste streams and collection methods.
Locations of specific waste stream containers and management/pickup frequencies.
Solid waste stream assessment (identification of waste stream components and percentages).
Opportunities for new recyclable waste streams and best management practices for collection/removal.
Employee training.
Signage for specific waste stream collection.

FULL TIME ON-SITE CONTRACTOR 

The Contractor shall provide a full-time on-site employee (40 hrs per week) to work with the COR to aggressively manage the recycling program for TVHS.  This on-site contractor employee shall have the required expertise to manage a comprehensive recycling program preferably in the healthcare industry. This on-site contractor employee will be henceforth referred to as the Recycling & Waste Management Contractor Coordinator (RWMCC) throughout this document and will be required to provide input and guidance from a contractor point of view on committees and task forces with the COR and at the discretion of the COR.  The RWMCC will need access to VA computer systems and will be required to submit to a background check and fingerprinting in order to obtain the required access.  The RWMCC is not a VA employee and as such will NOT be treated as a VA employee.  

TVHS shall provide the RWMCC with furnished office space at the Alvin C. York Campus however, the RWMCC shall be required to travel to the Nashville campus regularly and to the outpatient clinics at least twice annually to inspect and review their recycling programs and progress.  Deviations from this frequency shall be approved by the COR.
The RWMCC shall be required to generate data and report on the progress of recycling at TVHS.
The RWMCC shall enter recycling and waste data into Greenhealth Tracker, the Federal Government s waste portal.  This will be done after the COR has reviewed and approved the data to be entered.  This is a checks-and-balances process to ensure the contractor is entering appropriate information.
The RWMCC shall make presentations and conduct demonstrations of products, services, and techniques to TVHS staff. 
A formal meeting will take place between the Contractor s person(s) responsible for the management of this contract, COR, and CO quarterly.  All parties have the right to have any others they deem necessary to the discussion be present and participate.  Topics of discussion will include past performance, issues and concerns, performance summary of the RWMCC, a review and update (modification as needed) of the comprehensive recycling plan, to name a few. 
The goal of TVHS is to recycle as much material as possible.  The RWMCC is tasked with developing processes to capture as many of the waste streams identified below.  Processes developed by the RWMCC shall be reasonable to implement by the VA without incurring substantial additional costs.   
At the option of TVHS based on the needs of the healthcare system, the RWMCC role may be discontinued starting with Option Year 3.  If the RWMCC role is discontinued, TVHS will assume responsibility for the functions previously charged to the RWMCC.  All other terms and conditions of the contract at that time will remain in full effect.  If the RWMCC role is discontinued, the CO will work with the Contractor to modify the contract and eliminate costs associated with the RWMCC role.

HISTORICAL DATA 
The following information is an analysis of current waste streams for FY17 for TVHS.  This information should give prospective offerors an expectation of volume and what waste streams will need to be captured:



















WASTE AUDIT

The Contractor shall provide TVHS an annual waste stream survey of all sites to include a formal written report after completion, in which the Contractor specifically reviews the waste generation and waste flow within each facility to determine areas of opportunity for waste reduction and elimination.  The audit will be based on what TVHS currently places in its waste streams.  This establishes the plan moving forward of what the offeror and the VA need to work on.  The first audit will be provided to the COR 90 days after award of the contract.

Once a clear reduction plan is approved, the Contractor and TVHS will implement the program.  The RWMCC and COR will develop and administer training to employees and work with them to achieve the program's goals. 

The Contractor shall provide a monthly tracking reporting system that shall allow for TVHS to track all wastes from the point of generation as a means to identify waste volume and classification. This report shall clearly demonstrate the facilities classification of wastes and opportunities for reduction. The report shall track all waste streams to include solid waste, recycling, and diverted wastes. The report shall also provide recycling data (e.g. pounds and type). The Contractor shall provide a sample of the proposed report to the COR for approval. This sample shall be submitted within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of the Notice of Award.  See Appendix A for a suggested format.

TRAINING REQUIREMENTS

The Contractor (RWMCC) and TVHS will train employees on the different types of waste in their area (solid waste, recyclables, etc.) and where to properly dispose of it. The contractor shall monitor and track cost, waste generation by type and location, and training records for employees. The frequencies and locations of training varies and is dependent on the deficiencies identified and programs and processes implemented.  All training records shall be sent electronically to the COR.  

The Contractor understands that the RWMCC shall be required to provide subsequent briefing and in-service training for TVHS in support of contractor objectives. This training shall be conducted at no additional cost to the VA. Dates and times of training will be mutually agreed upon between the Contractor and the COR.  The Contractor shall provide training for all sites as deemed necessary to include initial training for Environmental Management Service personnel on any new procedures relative to the handling/processing of the different waste streams. All training schedules shall be coordinated with the COR.

MONETARY RECYCLING CREDIT  
The VA understands the recycling market varies over time with respect to waste streams that have value rather than cost.  The Contractor will furnish to the COR a revised listing of all waste streams with credits reflecting increases or decreases quarterly.  The listing will be broken out by waste stream and when feasible reference industry markets or demands citing increases or decreases. Any monetary recycling credit due to TVHS for recyclable materials will be paid within 30 days of processing materials along with a description of the materials recycled and the credit applied to each category of recyclable materials.  Credits due to TVHS will be paid to the facility through CHECK rather than deducted from the monthly invoice.  The check shall be made out to  Tennessee Valley Healthcare System  and must include the verbiage:  recycling revenue for deposit in FCP 581. 

COMPACTOR REQUIREMENTS
10.1  Maintenance.  The contractor shall maintain all compactors in proper operating condition according to the manufacturer s specifications. 
In the event of failure the contractor shall respond to the maintenance request within 24 hours from the time the contractor is notified of any failure. Contractor will provide a 24-hour emergency number for TVHS to call in the event of an emergency.  If the contractor cannot repair the compactor(s) within 24 hours of notification, the contractor shall replace the self-contained unit associated with the inoperative compactor with a comparable size open-top container. In this event, unless the self-contained unit is full, the contractor shall not charge TVHS for removal of the waste within the self-contained unit. 

Only the contractor s experienced and qualified personnel shall repair and maintain the equipment. In addition, the contractor shall repair and maintain the equipment in accordance with manufacturer s specifications.  There should be no charge to the VA for any repairs or maintenance on Contractor s equipment unless such damage is determined to be due to negligence or vandalism of TVHS.

The contractor shall use compactors that are fully enclosed, vermin-proof, leak-proof, fire-retardant, clean and sanitized.  TVHS reserves the right to request containers be cleaned due to foul odors or other contaminants.  Requests to clean containers will be fulfilled within 24 hours of notification and at no additional charge to TVHS.

All compactors shall include the latest energy efficient technology.  TVHS recommends similar technology to Waste Management s SmartEnergy  Compactors.  Benefits of this technology include: 

Reduction of electricity consumption by as much as 70% versus traditional compactors resulting in lower operating costs and a reduced carbon footprint.
Provides lower energy usage through equal compaction performance and cycle times compared to traditional compactors.
Equipped with compactor monitoring technology.  This enables a waste company to optimize when a compactor needs to be emptied, eliminating unnecessary pickups and greenhouse gas emissions.  
TVHS has the responsibility of being efficient with tax payer dollars.  If the use of this technology indicates that a particular compactor is requiring twice weekly pickup, yet the Service Schedule identified in Section 2.2 indicates four times weekly, then the Contractor will empty the compactor twice weekly and bill TVHS for two pickups.  To maximize efficiency and minimize the impact on the environment, the use of this technology supersedes the Service Schedule in Section 2.2.
Electronic controls are powered by solar energy, while the compactor cycle is traditionally powered. If the compactor doesn t have the maximum solar charge, it is equipped with constant AC-powered backup so that we can always run a cycle while the battery recovers.
The compactor has a  two-speed  system, which actually  downshifts  when it needs more compression and uses less energy than a traditional one-speed system.
Charge box fullness indicator encourages users to run cycles only when needed, reducing our company s electricity usage and carbon footprint.
This technology and equipment is a visible statement to our stakeholders about our commitment to sustainability. 
The Contractor shall submit a cutsheet of the proposed equipment as part of their submittal so it may be reviewed by TVHS officials.

The contractor shall provide self-contained units with permanent hose couplings compatible with the city or town fire department s equipment in which the unit is located.  
10.2  Keys.  All compactors and other equipment that require keys will be keyed alike throughout TVHS.  An adequate supply of keys will be provided to the COR upon request without additional charge.
10.3 Hydraulic Fluid.  All hydraulic equipment shall utilize vegetable or other non-toxic environmentally friendly fluid that will minimize impact to the environment.  Contractor must use all reasonable efforts to mitigate any leaks and all incidents of leaking equipment will be reported to the COR without delay and without failure regardless of the size of the leak.  The Contractor shall submit a cutsheet of the proposed equipment as part of their submittal so it may be reviewed by TVHS.

OTHER REQUIREMENTS
11.1  Licenses/permits. The Contractor shall obtain all licenses and permits necessary to perform the work under the contract.
11.2  Documentation. Contractor will be required to supply monthly data to the COR. This data will include (1) weight of waste picked up at TVHS for the prior month, (2) the cost that TVHS paid to the contractor for the prior month, and (3) the amount of waste diverted toward recycling. All data will be broken down by campus (and satellite locations as applicable). All data will be broken down by disposed/recycled items (eg. Solid Waste, Cardboard, Metal, Yard Waste, etc.) and shall be reported in pounds or tons along with the credit or cost for that category of materials.  All data shall be submitted to the COR by the 7th day of the following month. The COR may provide a standard form to the contractor for the contractor to complete.  See Appendix A for a suggested format.  Contractor will provide Certificates of Recycling or an equivalent to validate material sent for recycling. The data shall be emailed to the COR.  
11.3  Invoicing. Vendor will submit one invoice per campus, monthly in arrears to the VA Electronic Payment System http://www.tungsten-network.com/US/en/veterans-affairs.  Invoice will include the dates of service performed during that month along with the number of containers pulled. Invoice format shall reflect and not deviate from the pricing cost proposal submitted (sample provided below).

<p><strong>52.212-2 - Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Oct 2014)<br /></strong>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>Technical: Acceptable/Unacceptable<br />Past Performance: Acceptable/Unacceptable<br />Price</p>
<p>Price: Price will be reviewed and evaluated based on the CLINs shown above under "Description of Requirement". The Offeror's Price quote will be evaluated on a Total Evaluated Price (TEP) basis to include all option years. The Offeror must submit 5 coefficients for each year in order to be considered acceptable.</p>
<p>Technical Evaluation: In accordance with, FAR 52.212-1(b)(4), offerors are reminded that as a minimum, offers must show a technical description of the items being offered insufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation. This may include product literature, or other documents, if necessary.<br />Table A-1. Technical Acceptable/Unacceptable Ratings<br />Rating Description<br />Acceptable Quote clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.<br />Unacceptable Quote does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>Past Performance Evaluation: The past performance evaluation is an assessment of the offeror's probability of meeting the minimum past performance solicitation requirements. This assessment is based on the offeror's record of relevant and recent past performance information that pertain to the services outlined in the Performance Work Statement.</p>
<p>Recency is defined as projects performed within the last three (3) years of the issue month of the solicitation. All references for work not performed within three (3) years of the issue month of the solicitation will not be evaluated.</p>
<p>Relevancy is defined as contracts involving type of services and work elements described in the attached Performance Work Statement dated 30 November 2017.</p>
<p>Table A-2. Past Performance Acceptable/Unacceptable Ratings<br />Rating Description<br />Acceptable Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown.<br />Unacceptable Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government does not have a reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>No Recent/Relevant Past Performance: In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305 (a)(2)(iv)). Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown (or "neutral") past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, a neutral rating shall be considered "acceptable."</p>
<p>Sources of Past Performance: Offerors shall provide their past performance submission and are limited to 5 pages. Past performance information may be obtained from established systems such as the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), or other databases; and may be obtained from other sources available to the Government.</p>
<p>Technical and past performance, when combined, are approximately equal to price.</p>
<p>Initially, all offers will be ranked according to Price from lowest to highest. The lowest priced offeror will be evaluated for technical acceptability. If this offeror is acceptable then their past performance will be evaluated for acceptability. If the lowest priced offeror is technically acceptable and has acceptable past performance then evaluation will stop and award will be made to the lowest priced offeror. If the lowest priced offeror is not found to be technically acceptable or have acceptable past performance then the evaluation will continue with the next highest offer and continue until an acceptable offeror is found.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.<BR><BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.

(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ``I agree'' click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ``click-wrap'' or ``browse-wrap'' agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(2) Paragraph (u) (1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.

(End of clause)<BR><BR>(a)U.S. and Coalition Commanders possess inherent authority to maintain law and order, provide security, and impose discipline necessary to protect the inhabitants of U.S. and/or Coalition installations, U.S. and Coalition personnel operating outside of installations, and U.S. or Coalition-funded developmental projects in Afghanistan.  This authority allows commanders to administratively and physically control access to installations and/or project sites, and to bar contracts  including prime contractors, subcontractors at any tier, and any employees, from an installation or site. A commanders inherent force protection (FP) authority is independent of an agencys contracting authority, and it may not be superseded by any contractual term or provision.

(b)The prime Contractor/Vendor acknowledges that:  submission of a bid, offer, or a proposal; acceptance of contract award of any type; or continuing effort under any contract that includes this clause; requires that the prime Contractor/Vendor, and all subcontractors under any affected contracts be initially eligible  and remain eligible during the entire period of contract performance to include any warrant period  for installation access to a U.S. and/or Coalition installation, regardless of whether the performance will take place on or off a U.S. or Coalition installation.<BR><BR>(c)To be eligible for installation access, Contractors and subcontractors at all tiers are required to register for installation access in the Joint Contingency Contracting System (JCCS) and are responsible for keeping the information in the this system updated at all times.  Prime Contractors and subcontractors at any tier may verify their registration at https://www.jccs.gov/jccscoe/ by selecting the Vendors Login module and logging in with their user name and password.  The offeror must be registered, approved, and eligible for installation access prior to award, and remain eligible for installation access for the life of the contract.

(1)The offeror is required to submit a listing of all proposed subcontractors , at all tiers, to  the contracting officer with the submission of the proposal, and provide updates during the life of the contract when subcontractors are added or removed. If no subcontractors are expected to perform during the life of the contract, the offeror must submit a negative response to the Contracting Officer with its proposal. After award, the prime contractor must submit a negative response to the contracting officer at the beginning of each performance period.

(2)Failure to be approved in JCCS  and thereby be eligible for installation access at the Prime and subcontractor levels  or failure to inform the contracting officer of the names of all prospective subcontractors (or provide a negative reply), may render the offerors/contractor ineligible for award or continued performance.  Additionally, any firm that is declared ineligible for installation access will be deemed non-responsible until such time as that firm is again deemed eligible by the appropriate access approval authority.

(d)Installation access determinations arise from the Combatant Commanders inherent authority and are separate and distinct from any law, regulation, or policy regarding suspension and debarment authority.  Contractor queries or requests for reconsideration related to U.S. or Coalition installation base access eligibility must be directed to the authority responsible for base access decisions.

(End of Clause)<BR><BR>(a)This solicitation may be protested to the issuing Contracting Office for decision by the Contracting Officer or by the Chief of the Regional Contracting Center if authority has been withheld.  If requested, an independent review of an Agency Protest decision is available through appeal to the Principal Assistant Responsible for Contracting (PARC) in accordance with FAR 33.103.  A protest to ECC-A is a PROTEST TO THE AGENCY, within the meaning of FAR 33.103.  The ECC-A Agency Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within ECC-A, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  After an interested party files an Agency Protest with the Contracting Officer and while that protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum.  If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the Agency Protest, the Agency Protest will be dismissed.

(b)An interested party may file a written protest to the Contracting Officer under the ECC-A Agency Protest program for contract solicitations issued by ECC-A. Such Agency Protests are limited to objections to any of the following:

(1) A solicitation or other request by an agency for offers for a contract for the procurement of property or services.

(2)  The cancellation of the solicitation or other request.

(3)  An award or proposed award of the contract.<BR><BR>a. Movement and coordination of inbound and outbound cargo in Afghanistan is critical to ensuring an effective drawdown.
