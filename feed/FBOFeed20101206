<DESC>NASA/DFRC has a requirement to extend the performance period of the DFRC SecuritySupport Services Contract for a maximum of twelve months (January 1, 2011 - December 31,2011); said extension will consist of one nine(9) month performance period and one(1)three-month option period, the exercise of each option being determined by the Governmentneed to continue with the support. A contract modification reflecting this extension willbe issued on or before December 31, 2010, which is the expiration date of the currentsecurity support services contract. NASA DFRC intends to extend the period of performanceof contract NNA04AC17D, for protective services which was awarded as a result of full andopen competition under a GSA Schedule to Wackenhut Services, Inc. (WSI) on November 1,2004. This extension is necessary to bridge the performance period between the end of thecurrent contract and award of a new NASA Dryden Protective Service contract.Authorization of this extension has been issued by NASA Headquarters under ProcurementInformation Circular (PIC)10-15, dated October 13, 2010, which provides a class deviationfrom the requirements of FAR 17.204(e) and NASA FAR Supplement (NFS) 1817.204(e)(iii),limiting the terms of service contracts to five (5) years, including the basic contractand all options. This class deviation applies only to existing contract requirements thatwill ultimately be provided under a new NASA Dryden Protective Services Contract. NASA is using the authority for Other Than Full and Open Competition provided by 10U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), because Wackenhut Services, Inc. (WSI) possesses unique expertise inmeeting the security requirements of the Center, no alternate source could adequatelyprovide for the maintenance of the Centers comprehensive security program during thisextension period.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See Note26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon December 13, 2010. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All questions MUST bein writing and should be directed to Mr. Medina not later than 4:30 p.m. local time onDecember 13, 2010. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The installation Ombudsman is is Mr.Patrick C.

<DESC>The purpose of this public announcement is to inform industry of the FAA's intent to award a single source contract in accordance with AMS 3.2.2.4 to CAE, Inc., 2351 Alfred Nobel Blvd., Saint-Laurent, Quebec, Canada.  The potential five-year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract will provide support for technical refresh initiatives for the Airbus 330/340 and B737-800 Level D Simulators on as ordered basis in accordance with the attached Draft Statement of Work (SOW).  The estimated value is between $6,000,000.00 to $8,000,000.00.  The FAA has determined that only CAE can meet this requirement at this time for the following reasons:
Specialized Expertise:  CAE, Inc. is the manufacturer that developed and built both the B737-800 and Airbus 330/340 simulators.  This vendor is in the unique position of being able to provide hardware and software upgrades to its simulators in an efficient and cost effective manner.  If this particular vendor is not selected, significant aerospace testing research delays and system uncertainty will be incurred while vetting another vendor whose upgrade may or may not meet the FAA research requirements.  Thus, the FAA may incur costly delays critical to FAA research supporting NextGen activities.  These costly delays will result in an undetermined dollar impact to the industry, aerospace infrastructure, and the FAA.  
Proprietary Data:  This vendor has developed proprietary software, data, and information (publications or documentation) at its own expense that remain the property of CAE.  The FAA has limited rights to this software, data, and information specified in the current contracts Rights in Data clauses.  In order to install an upgrade or enhancement, a potential contractor would require access to this CAE proprietary software, data and information.  Under contract DTFAAC-07-C-00025, paragraph G.10 entitled "License to Use CAE Proprietary Software and Information", the FAA can only provide this proprietary software, data and information to a third party for research and development purposes only, and on the condition that the third party shall not be a competitor or potential competitor of CAE.  
Although the FAA has determined that this is a single source award based on the specifics above, we want to provide vendors an opportunity to respond to this announcement.  Any information received in response to this public announcement will be used for informational purposes only and will not be released.  Any proprietary information submitted will be protected if appropriately marked.  Vendor participation in any informational session is not a promise of future business with the FAA.  The FAA will not reimburse vendors responding to this public announcement.
If you have any questions or comment please respond by 2:00pm December 27, 2010 by email to katherine.m.williams@faa.gov.  Electronic responses are preferred.  The point of contact for this requirement is Katherine M. Williams (202) 267-3669.

<DESC>Purpose of the Announcement: In accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System (FAA AMS) paragraph 3.2.2.4, to inform industry of the basis of the FAA's decision to contact with a selected source via single source procedures.
The FAA, William J Hughes Technical Center intends to award a single source contract to Esterline CMC Technologies.
The furniture is currently being used by the FAA to support their requirements and therefore unable to obtain through any other known source.
Esterline CMC Technologies brings the following essential data experience:
- The FAA Technical Center Convair 580 aircraft must be equipped with certified GPS/WAAS avionics.- These avionics are being installed to provide lessons learned to reduce technical and schedule risk for a separate project with US Airways.- The avionics chosen for this other project are made by Esterline CMC.  These avionics are certified.  Only certified avionics are acceptable for this procurement.- To purchase avionics from another manufacturer would be of no value to the FAA since they could not be used to reduce technical and schedule risk for the other project.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration, William J. Hughes Technical Center (WJHTC), is conducting a Market Survey to improve the Government's understanding of the current marketplace and to identify capable sources. This public announcement is a survey not a solicitation, to determine interest, options and capabilities of the public industry.
Responses to this market survey will be used to determine if there is adequate competition to set the requirement aside for Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Businesses (SEDB/8(a)), Small Businesses, Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB), etc. This survey is being conducted in accordance with FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) Section 3.2.1.2.1. This survey will support market research obtained from multiple sources and will be utilized for planning purposes only. Since this is a sources sought announcement, no evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the respondents.
All interested vendors are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred that are associated with any response received from industry in response to this announcement. Therefore, any costs associated with vendor's submissions will be solely at the interested vendor's expense.
The WJHTC would like to determine the level of expertise and interest from industry to compile a list of options for providing fire suppression on the main deck of freighter aircraft. The options would need to be effective regardless of whether the cargo was in Unit Load Devices (ULD's, also called containers), on pallets, or in a mixture of ULDs and pallets. Fire suppression would also have to be effective for the maximum diversion time of any route that freighter aircraft could fly. The options could be aircraft based, ULD based, or any combination of techniques, including depressurization of the aircraft. The options could also be limited to specified size ranges of aircraft cargo compartments. 
The options would be required to be technically viable and effective on the types of fires likely to occur on freighter aircraft. The viability assessment would include the availability of the proposed technology, potential future environmental restrictions, toxicity, aircraft material compatibility, required maintenance issues, and the effects on cargo airline operations. The compiled list of suppression options would also have to be individually evaluated for effectiveness over a range of possible inflight scenarios and would need to include costs for both initial installation and recurring operational costs. 
The goal of this effort is to compile all of the possible approaches to provide freighter aircraft fire suppression based on the state of the art techniques in the fire protection industry. The Fire Safety Team would evaluate the responses to this Request for Information (RFI) and determine if a contractual effort would be initiated after the evaluation is completed.
Interested companies are required to provide a summary of not more than fifteen pages that address the capabilities and possible options as stated above and complete the attached Business Declaration form. 
Responses will not be returned. This is a sources sought announcement so NO solicitation exists. 
Any information provided in response to announcement will be used for informational purposes only and will not be released.  Any proprietary information submitted will be protected if appropriately marked.  Vendor participation in any informational session is not a promise of future business with the FAA.
Response submittals must include the following information (Submittals must be by email):
a)   Point of contactb)   Email addressc)   Verification of registration in the Central Contractor's Registration (CCR)d) Completed Business Declaration Form (see attachments)
All questions are to be submitted, via email, to elizabeth.ford@faa.gov not later than 2pm Eastern Standard Time December 16, 2010. No telephone inquiries will be accepted.
All responses to this announcement must be submitted via email, including attachments, to:elizabeth.ford@faa.gov, not later than 2pm Eastern Standard Time on December 20, 2010.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division (NSWCCD) intends to negotiate a sole-source procurement with Martel Laboratories of Baltimore, MD.  Martel Laboratories will provide personnel, services, facilities, and materials necessary to perform the analyses of non-oily shipboard wastewater.  The personnel at the Martel Labs have past experience with the U.S. Navy regarding analysis of shipboard wastewater.  Water quality data analyses produced by any other laboratory would deviate from the baseline created from Martel's analyses. 

The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit with only one source using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.
  A firm fixed-price purchase order is anticipated.  This notice of intent is not a request for competition quotations.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

No additional information related to this notice will be provided.  Responses to this notice may be emailed to patricia.perzella@navy.mil and received by 4:00 p.m. eastern standard time 16 DEC 2010.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>FFAVORS/Web Application Migration &amp; Support Services
<p><br />Background</p>
<p>The Department of Defense's (DoD) Fresh Fruit and Vegetable program provides fruit and vegetables to participating agencies for NSLP and FDPIR programs using approximately fifty regional contracts. FFAVORS/Web is a Department of Defense application that supports approximately three thousand organizations and eight thousand users for order management, entitlement management, and catalog maintenance functions. Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) agreed to assume management and support of the FFAVORS/Web application by June 30, 2011 and implement system security controls to meet DoD's standards, using the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) e-Authentication service.</p>
<p>The business processes supported by the FFAVORS/Web application will migrate to the Web Based Supply Chain Management (WBSCM) as a system enhancement. The migration will support the goal of increased fruit and vegetable consumption in nutrition assistance programs and local procurement of fruit and vegetable items through farm to school programs.</p>
<p>The FFAVORS software environment consists of Cold Fusion, Crystal Reports and Oracle database.</p>
<p>Scope of Work:</p>
<p>1. Establish development environment. The following development tasks have been identified to date:</p>
<p>&bull; Develop interfaces to two DoD applications for catalog/contract maintenance and goods receipts/payments.</p>
<p>&bull; Integrate FFAVORS/Web with the USDA e-Authentication system and establish an automated user conversion and registration process to support user migration.</p>
<p>2. Migrating code and database structures to NITC and testing successful migration</p>
<p>3. Integrating and testing the FFAVORS application with the USDA's e-Authentication system and developing an automated e-Authentication FFAVORS registration process <br /><br />4. Developing and testing interfaces between FFAVORS and Defense Logistics Agency's (DLA) systems for product catalog maintenance and invoice payments</p>
<p>5. Migrating users from the current logon ID solution to the e-Authentication solution</p>
<p>6. Complete USDA's Certification and Accreditation Phase I activities</p>
<p>7. Coordinate completion of the Certification and Accreditation Phase II activities and concurrency review with USDA's Cyber-security department</p>
<p>8. Load DoD's FFAVORS data into USDA's FFAVORS</p>
<p>9. Perform Operations and Maintenance support of the application after a successful migration</p>
<p>FNS FFAVORS/Web Migration and O&amp;M Support</p>
<p>Tasks:<br /><br />1. Establish development environment<br /><br />2. Migration code and database structure to NITC/Testing <br /><br />3. Integration and testing FFAVORS application with UDDA's e-Authentication&nbsp; System<br /><br />4. Develop automated e-authentication FFAVORS registration process <br /><br />5. Develop and test interfaces between FFAVORS and DLA' systems for product catalog maintenance and invoice payment <br /><br />6. Migrate users from current logon ID solution to the <br />e-authentication solution <br /><br />7. Complete Certification &amp; Accreditation Phase I activities <br /><br />8. Complete Certification &amp; Accreditation Phase II activities <br /><br />9. Review C&amp;A activities with USDA's cyber-security department <br />Load DOD's FFAVORS data into USDA's FFAVORS <br /><br />10. USDA FFAVORS Live /Provide Operations and Maintenance Support</p>
<p>The FFAVORS/Web application migration timeline is extremely aggressive. Failure to meet the timeline may result in terminating support for the application, which will affect the ability to support the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable program required by the Farm Bill.</p>
<p>The FFAVORS/Web application is destined to be hosted at USDA National Information Technology Center (NITC) sharing the Electronic Commodity Ordering System (ECOS) servers. The ECOS application and FFAVORS application will be in production status concurrently for at least 15 months. This parallel processing will affect web and database servers shared by the two applications.</p>

<DESC>REFERENCES:

(a) NAVSEA SS800-AG-MAN-010/P-9290 (P-9290), SYSTEM CERTIFICATION PROCEDURES AND CRITERIA MANUAL FOR DEEP SUBMERGENCE SYSTEMS

DESCRIPTION: This RFI is being conducted to request a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost and schedule to perform the following efforts:

a)	To design, construct, install on a host submarine, certify for manned operations in accordance with reference (a), and operationally test a fifty inch (50) extension to an existing DDS.  This 50 extension will be welded to the aft end of the existing hangar.  Estimate should consider both OHIO Class Submersible Ship Guided Nuclear (SSGN) and VIRGINIA Class Host Submarines.  The Government does not intend to install an extended DDS on any LOS ANGELES Class submarines.

b)	Develop improvements to the DDS Hangar Outer Door to allow remote operation (unlock, open/close, lock) of the door.

c)	Develop improvements to assist personnel in the deployment and retrieval of the track and cradle system from the extended shelter for a payload that weighs significantly more than the existing SDV.

This RFI is for fact finding only and does not constitute a commitment or obligation by the Government to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP), contract or order.
  The Government will not pay for any effort expended or any material provided in response to this announcement, nor will the Government return any data provided.

BACKGROUND: The existing six (6) DDSs are 9 feet wide, 9 feet high, 38 feet long, and displace approximately 35 tons.  A DDS is currently capable of carrying a payload of 15,000 pounds.  The DDS consists of three interconnected compartments made of HY-80 steel within a fiberglass fairing, each capable of independent internal pressurization to a depth of at least 130 feet.  When attached to its host submarine, the DDS can withstand external pressure to the submarine's full depth capability.  The existing DDS can be hosted by specifically modified LOS ANGELES, VIRGINIA, and OHIO (SSGN) Class submarines.
  The forward-most compartment, a sphere, is the hyperbaric chamber which is used for treatment of injured divers.  In the middle compartment, or transfer trunk, operators enter and exit the submarine and/or either of the other compartments.  The third compartment, the hangar, is a cylinder with elliptical ends. 

The Fleet has identified a need to deploy larger payloads than the existing DDS can accommodate.  The capabilities of these larger payloads are constrained by the space and payload weight carrying capacity, as well as the launch and recovery methods of the current DDS.  As a result of this needed capability, an extension to the hangar compartment of 50 is necessary.  Additionally, the Government is investigating options to allow the remote operation (unlock, open/close, lock) of the Hangar Outer Door and improvements to assist personnel in the deployment of the Track and Cradle with a larger payload.
  

The current DDS operating procedures for the Hangar Outer Door require that DDS personnel manually release eighteen (18) swing bolts which hold the door in the closed position from the inside of the hangar prior to opening the door with hydraulic power assistance.  Once closed, DDS personnel must engage the swing bolts to lock the door shut.  Larger payloads envisioned for the extended DDS may make the hangar door inaccessible from inside the shelter, requiring an alternate approach to Hangar Outer Door operation.  

The current DDS operating procedures for the Track and Cradle require that DDS personnel, nominally two divers, manually pull the track from the DDS, extend support legs and lock the track into blocks on the host.
  The cradle with payload is then pulled out onto the track via manual winch.  Larger payloads will require a more robust track and cradle system, which could be beyond the physical capability of divers to manually deploy and retrieve.  Approaches to assist divers in the deployment and retrieval of a more robust track and cradle with a larger payload are desired.

For this RFI, a notional payload of 60" beam, 60" height, and 28,000 pounds is envisioned with a hangar extension not to exceed 50.  The extent of any increased dimensions or weight to the DDS may be constrained by various design factors of the host submarines.  These factors include, but are not limited to, weight margin for host submarine stability, host submarine load-out within the existing equilibrium polygon, structural constraints for mounting the DDS, and required piping and electrical interfaces between the DDS and host submarine.
  These design constraints are identified within the drawings for host submarines.

APPROACH: The Government may provide limited access to a DDS for ship checks on a not to interfere basis and expects to provide the following items to potential responders upon request as discussed below: 
a) Drawings of the current DDS units, external and internal configurations 
b) Specifications used to design and build the current DDS units
c) Current SDV launch and recovery procedures
d) Topside arrangement drawings for VIRGINIA Class and OHIO Class SSGN host submarines

DATA LIBRARY: The Government will provide upon request, a classified electronic library (e.g. CDs) for responder accessibility to the GFI data/documents identified above for those responders cleared to receive the level of classified data.
  In addition, the documents will be made available at or near the Program Office located at the Washington Navy Yard in the District of Columbia.  The Government does not warrant the content and performance of the design data contained therein.  Respondents may submit a request for classified information up to the Confidential level to: Naval Sea Systems Command Attn: Brian Pelletier, Code PMS399A4, 614 Sicard Street SE, Stop 8840, Washington Navy Yard DC 20376-8840, phone 202-781-1927, e-mail brian.c.pelletier@navy.mil.  Requests shall specifically include Respondents Name, Address and Zip Code, Cage Code and Cognizant Security Office (Name Address and Zip Code ) as well as the actual performance location including: Address and Zip Code, Cage Code and Cognizant Security Office, Address and Zip Code.
  Classified documents will be forwarded only after Government review of the respondent's authorized security level.  Access to classified information shall only be for the duration of the RFI including Government evaluation of the RFI responses.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to identify the availability of businesses capable of providing environmental management services for the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) field offices nationwide. Services include compliance management, collection, storage, packaging, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials voluntarily abandoned at airport security checkpoints and other TSA facilities, including other hazardous waste generated by the TSA. The contractor must be able to provide all services to all airport locations throughout the Continental United States, Hawaii, Alaska, Guam, US Virgin Islands and US Territories. All companies capable of fulfilling this requirement as described below may respond.<br /><br />This notice is for market research purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Quote or Request for Proposal; and, it is not considered to be a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited; no basis for claim against the Government shall arise as a result from a response to this Sources Sought or Government use of any information provided. At this time no solicitation exists; therefore, DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION. The Government reserves the right to consider any arrangement as deemed appropriate for this procurement, including the ultimate acquisition approach.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background<br /></span></strong>Prior to passage of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA), Pub.L. 107 71, the air carriers were responsible for the screening of commercial air carrier passengers. They were also responsible for the collection and disposition of all prohibited items, including hazardous materials. With the passage of ATSA, TSA became responsible for passenger screening. 49 U.S.C. &sect;44901(a).
<p>As a result, TSA determined that it would accept prohibited items abandoned by passengers at security checkpoints. Having accepted the property, TSA is legally liable for the disposition of abandoned or forfeited personal property. Hazardous materials, if not otherwise donated per 41 CFR 101-42.304, must be disposed of in accordance with Federal and state laws and regulations. 42 U.S.C. &sect;6901 et seq.</p>
<p>In 2006, TSA issued the National Hazardous Materials Management and Disposal Contract to assist with the management, disposition and disposal of the prohibited hazardous material items abandoned by passengers at security checkpoints. Liquids, Gels, and Aerosols (LGA) were added to the prohibited list in August 2006 while lighters were removed from the prohibited list in August 2007.

<DESC>Introduction

This announcement constitutes an RFI notice for planning purposes.  This is NOT a Request for Proposals.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS EXIST AT THIS TIME.  This RFI does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL) will take procurement action in this matter.  Further, neither MCWL nor the Government will be responsible for any cost incurred in furnishing this information.

During December 2009, MCWL conducted experimentation in support of Enhanced Company Operations (ECO).  Doctrinal, organizational, training, manning, and equipping concepts and technologies were tested and evaluated in this experiment.  The goal was to promote sustained independent operations of infantry-centric Company Landing Teams (CLTs).
  One particular focus was advanced power alternatives intended for sustaining dismounted small units in the field for extended periods with minimal resupply.  During the experiment, MCWL used fuel cells as a method to recharge batteries for individual Marines systems such as communications equipment.  While this method reduced the overall number of batteries needed, resupply of the fuel cells themselves was still required.  MCWL noted the continuing need for a means for dismounted small units to use renewable technologies to recharge batteries on-the-move.

The current, follow-on focus is experimentation in support of Enhanced Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) Operations (EMO).  MCWL is researching concepts and technologies for supporting CLTs from Navy sea bases.
  One set of objectives is the overall reduction of power requirements, on-the-move power generation and battery recharging, and lightening the load for dismounted small units.

The purpose of this RFI is to inform MCWL of power-related concepts and technologies relevant to dismounted small units.

Submissions shall address concepts and technologies that could result in:
1)	Increased number of hours individual Marines and small units can operate without requiring battery resupply.
2)	A means for individual Marines and small units to charge batteries on-the-go via small, lightweight, renewable power sources.
3)	Increased battery energy density (energy per unit volume) and specific energy (energy per unit mass) for currently fielded battery form-factors (e.g.
 BA-5590, BB-2590, and compatibles).
4)	Reduced logistics resupply demand associated with delivering charged batteries and collecting used batteries.
5)	Reduced number of individual battery form factors (e.g. AA, CR-123, BA-2590, proprietary communications systems batteries, etc.) needed during resupply.

The intent of this RFI is to assist MCWL in investigating potential candidate concepts, key and enabling technologies, and technology development efforts that can reduce power-related combat load, power consumption, and logistics resupply demands for the MAGTF, and CLTs deployed ashore from sea bases.
Response, Submittal and Instructions
Questions pertaining to this notice are requested to be submitted by email to Teri Snyder at teri.snyder@usmc.mil.

<DESC>Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Veterans Health Administration (VHA) - Interactive Bedside Care Tool (ePatient)

THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT.  THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY.  THE PURPOSE OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.  RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT WILL BE USED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO MAKE APPROPRIATE ACQUISITION DECISIONS.  A SUBSEQUENT SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT MAY FOLLOW.  RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ADEQUATE RESPONSE TO ANY FUTURE ANNOUNCEMENT.

This is a Sources Sought notice for an Interactive Patient Bedside Care Tool functional prototype (ePatient) support in support of the VHA Innovations program.  The objective of the project is to demonstrate how a modern patient terminal can bring the patient to be more actively involved in the care process, while also providing better entertainment and general information options.  This project tests an interactive patient bedside monitor that replaces the existing patient television found at our medical centers.  The unit would function as a normal TV but it would also function as an interactive tool for the patient's participation in their care.  The system would include educational videos on demand and general information about the medical center, as well as access to MyHealtheVet and display patient specific information related to their care.  Patient specific data will include but not be limited to scheduled appointments for the day, diet information, allergies, current physician, and assigned nursing staff.  

Working closely with the VA, the vendor will develop a Benefit Analysis Framework to assist the VA in understanding the business value of potential applications and uses of the bedside terminal.  The vendor will use the framework to fully define the solution to be piloted and to understand its workflow impact.  Finally, the vendor will oversee a 60-day pilot of the bedside terminal and assist Loma Linda in evaluating its effectiveness and value.  

It is requested that any interested party submit the information required below via email to the point of contact listed at this bottom of this announcement.

Interested contractors shall provide the following:

However, the NECO webpage as well as the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition webpage serve as alternatives if the FBO website is unavailable. 

MARKET SURVEY - SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS:  The Government is issuing this sources-sought announcement as part of a market survey.
  The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Spectrum Warfare Department, Airborne Electronic Attack Division is interested in receiving information from experienced Radio Frequency (RF) vendors concerning the design and fabrication of a low-cost, high power/low frequency test and evaluation enclosure to accommodate the test and evaluation (T&E) of Airborne Electronic Attack (AEA) antennas.  All interested sources are encouraged to submit company and product literature, references, rough order magnitude estimates, production lead-times, schedule, risk, required Government Furnished Equipment/Material, and any other pertinent information for the Governments consideration.

The top-level requirements for the enclosure are cited as follows: 

1.	Performance Requirements  The enclosure shall meet the following requirements:

a.	Provide high effective radiated power handling capabilities of 75dBm / 45dBw (31.62kW) at a Continuous Wave (CW) duty cycle.
  (Note:  45dBw is the minimum acceptable high effective radiated power handling capabilities.  Increased power handling capabilities (i.e., greater than 45dBw), are desired).    

b.	Withstand heat loads as high as 118C (244.4F) on any part of the interior surface of the enclosure.

c.	Be able to handle IEEE spectrum frequency bands HF-Ka, while adhering to electromagnetic compatibility standards.

d.	Provide air circulation sufficient to provide uniform cooling to the interior of the enclosure while the maximum RF energy ( 45dBw) is applied to the wall(s) of the enclosure.
 
e.	Rejection of up to 100KW of heat and capable of maintaining an interior air temperature of 24C (75.2F)  4 C (68F  82.4F).
 

f.	The absorber wall shall be capable of continuously dissipating 25kW of heat while receiving forced cooled air at a temperature of 24C (75.2F). 


  

2.	Build-To Requirements  The enclosure shall meet the following requirements: 

a.	The enclosure shall utilize TDK Inc. anechoic ferrite absorbing tiles (ICM-006 & IB-017) or equivalent anechoic tile material that is of the same composition and size as ICM-006 & IB-017 and meets the performance requirements cited in #1.  The ICM-006 & IB-017 or equivalent anechoic ferrite absorbing tile combination must completely cover the entire south wall of the enclosure and 1/3 of the east, west, ceiling and floor of the PRIME.
 IB-017 anechoic tile or equivalent is to cover the remaining interior space of the PRIME. (Note: If requested, recommended instructions on the installation of the tile shall be provided by the Government to the Contractor.  However, utilization of these instructions shall not relieve the Contractor from any of the requirements).  

b.	The enclosure shall utilize a closed-loop forced air cooling system to sink and cool extreme heat from the ferromagnetic anechoic tiles populating the interior of the enclosure.  Additionally, the cooling system shall utilize finned chill plates as a method to sink RF energy (heat) applied by unit under test (UUT) to the anechoic material.  The closed-loop forced air cooling system, which shall be located behind the interior-mounted tile finned chill plates, must be engineered and built to accommodate the cooling of the anechoic tiles populating the entire interior surfaces of the enclosure.
  Additionally, the cooling system shall be engineered to maximize reliability to facilitate ease of maintenance.  Isolation of any individual section shall not effect circulation or cooling capacity throughout the remainder of the system. Thus, when the UUT is radiating at high power/continuous wave and the beam is focused at any one specific interior location of the enclosures walls, this isolation will not compromise the cooling systems air flow.  

In addition, each cooling section shall include readily accessible electronic temperature sensors to be used to instantaneously monitor any chill plate within the enclosure.  All electrical connections from each electronic sensor shall be coupled to terminal blocks on one readily-accessible control panel.
  All system components, (i.e. gauges, sensors, etc.), shall be clearly labeled, using a Government approved method, to match all system-level drawings. 

c.	All finned chill plates shall be securely fastened in place and shall be installed in such a fashion that they may be easily removed for maintenance or replacement.  Each chill plate shall be constructed with protruding aluminum fins on the back of each (2 x 2) mounting structure, allowing the closed-loop forced air cooling system, as discussed in part 2.b above, to circulate chilled air throughout the enclosures finned chill plates.  The finned chill plates shall be of equal uniform dimension and weight and shall be interchangeable to allow for mounting to any location within the enclosure.
  Provisions shall be made in regards to each chill plate for both removal and installation while populated with tile.  If a gap between installed chill plates is required for thermal expansion or maintenance purposes, the uniform gap must be mutually agreed upon between the Government and Contractor prior to proceeding with populating the enclosure with the finned chill plates that have a gap between them.  When the complete chill plate and tile assembly is mounted to the frame structure, there shall be less than 1 ohm electrical resistance between each chill plate and earth ground.

d.	Additional enclosure materials that shall be needed to insure the optimal performance of the PRIME while in use are as follows: forced chilled air blower, heat exchanger, walkway, misc support equipment, etc.
 

e.	The PRIMEs frame structure shall be capable of supporting high power/low-frequency TDK or equivalent RF anechoic ferromagnetic absorber tiles across all six of the entire interior mounting surfaces, equating to an area of ~1,650.06 sq ft, based upon the interior dimensions of the enclosure (populated with the subject anechoic tile) of 20 3 (Length) 17 8 (Width) by 12 4 (Height).  

3.	Lab Space & PRIME Structure Dimensions  The room in which the enclosure is to be housed is ~ 22 3 (Length) by 19 2 (Width) by 14 4 (Height).  The exterior dimensions of the enclosure shall be at least 6, and at most 1, from the walls and ceiling of the room in which it resides, except bottom wall running the length of the enclosure as it does not have a wall against it and thus this requirement does not apply.

The interior dimensions of the enclosure (populated with anechoic tile) shall be 20 3 (Length) 17 8 (Width) by 12 4 (Height).  (Note:  Any changes to the dimensions of the PRIME must receive Government approval).  The circulation shall be sufficient to provide uniform cooling to all installed plates while a maximum RF energy is applied to the absorber wall.  The entrance to the enclosure shall utilize a double door design, with a width of 6 and a height of 7 4.
  The entrance shall be at the far right side of the bottom wall of the enclosure.

4.	Enclosure Weight Capacity - The total weight of the enclosure shall not exceed 71,864 lbs and shall not exceed the weight distribution requirement of 195 lbs/Sq ft.

<DESC>As part of on-going medical informatics initiatives within the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA is investigating the potential to re-define the existing VistA and Electronic Health Record (EHR) software and associated architectures as part of an open source software development community.  Health Informatics and Information Technology leadership from across the Department, as part of an Enterprise Architecture Summit conducted in September 2010 met to discuss how the Department's future EHR would:

-	Serve as the lead in, and foundation for, the dialogue among VA product developers, other Federal agencies, the health care IT industry, and the Open Source Community; and

-	Offer additional advanced features, design, to be implemented in phases, and take full advantage of newest development techniques to minimize cost and maximize innovation.

A report summarizing the discussions relative to necessary actions related to VistA and EHR enterprise architecture functional and technical requirements and governance needed for VA stand-up/participation in an open source software development environment is available at the Virtual Office of Acquisition (VOA) web page for VistA/EHR Enterprise Architecture at https://www.voa.va.gov.  Industry and academia, especially those currently operating in open source environments, are encouraged to review this report in preparation for upcoming market research and request for information notices relative to prospective acquisition activities related to this initiative.  Please be advised this notice does not constitute a request for proposals and no information is requested at this time.

Where prompted, enter the DUNS or Cage or Company Name and click "Submit Query". If you are presented with a list of DUNS numbers, you will need to pick the specific location and click on the DUNS<br />&bull; Scroll to the bottom of the Inquiry Results page. There you can see if anyone is listed as the EB POC. If no one is listed, the company has not identified an EB POC yet. See instructions to designate EB POC in CCR EB POC Update in CCR If a vendor sees that there is no one listed as your EB POC, they need to contact the CCR POC and ask the CCR to update the company's registration to include the EB POC</p>
<p>2. Determine if your organization will designate a Group Administrator (GAM) (Proceed to paragraph 4 if your not going to designate a GAM).<br />&bull; A GAM determines who has access to the WAWF vendor account. <br />&bull; The initial GAM shall be the person designated as the EB POC. To appoint additional GAM's, each vendor must submit an official appointment letter signed by the EB POC. <br />&bull; The appointment letter should be faxed to the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center. See sample GAM Appointment letter. <br />&bull; The GAM or EB POC shall provide the organizational email to the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center. Note: If you do not set up an organizational email address, the personal email address of the first person who self-registers from your firm will be designated as the email address for your firm.</p>
<p>3. Have all users self-register on the WAWF-RA web site. https://wawf.eb.mil<br />&bull; Every user for your firm must self-register on the WAWF-RA web site. <br />&bull; Select the "Self Register" link on the WAWF-RA home page and follow the instructions. <br />&bull; Users may access WAWF-RA with either a User ID/Password combination or a PKI certificate. <br />&bull; PKI Certificates may be obtained from one of the approved Interim External Certificate Authorities: Operational Research Consultants Inc. http://eca.orc.com, Digital Signature Trust Co. http://www.digsigtrust.com/ieca, Verisign: http://www.verisign.com. The web sites provide the instructions needed to acquire a PKI Certificate. <br />&bull; Note: Registrations will not be activated until the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center receives an email from the EB POC/GAM as registered in the CCR data- base.</p>
<p>4 Follow-up (if necessary).<br />&bull; If your (GAM or user) account hasn't been activated within 2 business days of self-registering contact the WAWF-RA Customer Service Center: 1-800-392-1798, Option 1 FAX Commercial: 801-605-7453 Email: cscassig@ogden.disa.mil Note: Reference "WAWF" in email Subject line.</p>
<p>5. You are responsible for the following activities:<br />&bull; Establish hierarchical sub-groups for managing user accounts, as necessary. Establish organizational e-mail for each CAGE code and submit these to the WAWF-RA Customer Service Center to activate your GAM account. Activate and update users in your group within one business day of request. Ensure that requests for user access are valid and assign access at the appropriate authorization and privilege level. Ensure that subordinate group administrators and alternates are created, as necessary. Intra-company user training.<br />As GAM, you are a critical part of maintaining system security. You are responsible for validating the "need to know" of the users that you activate, and would be responsible for de-activating an invalid user. Follow the procedures in the Group Administrator Manual (GAM). The manual must be downloaded from WAWF-RA production or training site.</p>

UNDERSTANDING WIDE AREA WORKFLOW  READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS TO EXPEDITE ELECTRONIC PAYMENT
 
(a) This contract action for commercial items of supply incorporates DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests.  For the Department of Defense, the MANDATORY method of electronic submission of payment requests is by Wide Area Workflow (WAWF.)  This means that paper invoices are not permitted and will not be processed for payment.  
 
(b) Definitions Important to the WAWF Process
 
Acceptor:  The organization or person designated in block 15 of the SF 1449 (cover page of the purchase request) who accepts the products or services tendered.  The acceptor has a unique DoDAAC (Department of Defense Activity Address Code) shown in the upper right had box of block 15 that must be used to notify the acceptor that an electronic invoice is pending.
 
DoDAAC:  As stated above, an acronym for Department of Defense Activity Address Code.  This code unique to each organization in the Department of Defense.  Knowledge of what DoDAAC codes must be input into WAWF electronic invoices is crucial to the payment process as it alerts the acceptor that an invoice is pending for acceptance and alerts the payment office that a completed action is ready to process for payment.
 
Payment Office: The location of the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) office shown in block 18a of the SF 1449 that will process your electronic invoices.  The payment office also has a unique DoDAAC.
 
(c) Options within WAWF include a combo for supply items,  a 2-in-1 invoice for service contracts and a stand-alone invoice. It is recommended that the use of , stand-alone invoices be avoided.   The matching of stand-alone invoices by DFAS offices requires invoices and receiving reports be separately or individually submitted by the vendor and the receiving activity  and can routinely cause lengthy delays and possible rejection because they do not appear together and therefore must be individually matched and then verified.  The use of the combo or 2-in-1 does not present this problem and avoids the attendant delays associated with matching.  Detailed instructions on how to create an invoice, as well as other topical issues, can be found at the WAWF training website at http://www.wawftraining.com .
 
(d) A key, important, and imperative step for vendors to take is to e-mail notification to the acceptor identified in the contract in block 15 by clicking on the Send More E-Mail Notifications link in WAWF upon submission of the electronic invoice instrument (combo or 2-in1).  This step provides notice to the acceptor of your pending invoice

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>2. Trays - The table in paragraph 7.0 also indicates that the maximum load will be 25 lb/tray w/4 trays. Can you please tell me if the trays need to be removable? (Yes. Rearrangement of shelves will allow processing of light weight parts that are larger than the space between shelf supports.)</p>
<p>3. Instrumentation type - Paragraph 7.0 indicates that the oven must incorporate instrumentation type D. Paragraphs 10.2.2 and 10.2.3 indicate that the oven must incorporate instrumentation type B. Can you please tell<br />me which instrumentation type the oven must comply? (Type D is correct. We do not require either load sensors or high-low sensors.)</p>
<p>4. Recorder - In order to meet AMS 2750D, all thermocouples must be recorded. Does the oven need to include a recorder? (These ovens will not require a recorder. We have a network of freestanding Honeywell Multitrend SX recorders, each capable of recording process data for up to 5 individual ovens. We require only thermocouple connection points at the ovens to connect to that system.)</p>
<p>Regarding the CLIN 0002 High Temperature Box Oven Purchase Specification:</p>
<p>1. Temperature operating range - The table in paragraph 7.0 indicates that the maximum working temperature is 1,050&deg;F. Can you please tell me the temperature range that the oven will be used and needs to meet the +/-10&deg;F temperature uniformity? (500&ordm;F to 1,050&ordm;F)</p>
<p>2. Trays - The table in paragraph 7.0 also indicates that the maximum load will be 25 lb/tray w/4 trays. Can you please tell me if the trays need to be removable? (Yes. See explanation above.)</p>
<p>3. Instrumentation type - Paragraph 7.0 indicates that the oven must incorporate instrumentation type D. Paragraphs 10.2.2 and 10.2.3 indicate that the oven must incorporate instrumentation type B. Can you please tell<br />me which instrumentation type the oven must comply? (Type D. See explanation above.)</p>
<p>4. Recorder - In order to meet AMS 2750D, all thermocouples must be recorded. Does the oven need to include a recorder? (No. See explanation<br />above.)</p>
<p>Regarding the CLIN 0003 Tempering Furnace Purchase Specification:</p>
<p>1. Temperature uniformity - Paragraph 5.3 indicates that the furnace must be capable maintaining a temperature uniformity of +/-10&deg;F. The table in paragraph 7.0 indicates that the furnace must be capable maintaining a<br />temperature uniformity of +/-25&deg;F. In addition, the furnace class 2 indicated in the table in paragraph 7 equates to a temperature uniformity of +/-10&deg;F. Can you please tell me the required temperature uniformity? (This<br />requires uniformity of &plusmn;25&ordm;F. It should be a Class 5 oven.)</p>
<p>2. Temperature operating range - The table in paragraph 7.0 indicates that the maximum working temperature is 1,250&deg;F. Can you please tell me the temperature range that the oven will be used and needs to meet the +/-10&deg;F or +/-25&deg;F temperature uniformity requirement? (700&ordm;F - 1,250&ordm;F)</p>
<p>3. Instrumentation type - Paragraph 7.0 indicates that the oven must incorporate instrumentation type D.

<p>4. Recorder - In order to meet AMS 2750D, all thermocouples must be recorded. Does the oven need to include a recorder? (This furnace does not require a recorder. See above explanation.)</p>
<p>Lastly, can you please tell me if it is acceptable to submit our proposal via email? If yes, do you also need a hard copy mailed to you for receipt before the offer due date/local time? (e-mail is preferred. DO not send a hard copy if you e-mail the proposal.)</p>

<p><br />PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>1a. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Local Communications Services. This factor pertains to switch and PBX sites only.</p>
<p>This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p><br />Factor 4 - Diversity.</p>
<p>This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound pictorial approach for diversity to include the methodology for accomplishing diversity.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>

<DESC><strong>Questions and Answers:</strong>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Is it desired that the guard be the same person every day?<br /><strong>A:</strong> As long as the time period 7:00 AM through 4:30 PM is covered, how it is covered is up to the offeror.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> The hours of operation indicate a 9.5 hour work day. Is there a way for the guard to have a lunch break within that period of time? <br /><strong>A:</strong> See previous answer. The station must be covered during that time period.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What are the specific duties that the guard will handle?<br /><strong>A:</strong> There are three main areas of concern: 1) Check-in and direct (as needed) Government Employees and Visitors; 2) Check secured areas throughout the premisis; 3) Co-ordinate with facility managers on security issues as they may arise. There may be other issues that arise as the job progresses, but they would be addressed as needed.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> A company employs primarily off-duty law enforcement officers from across the state. Would just one need a federal background check or each individual officer working the site? The notice seemed to indicate that each would.<br /><strong>A:</strong> Yes - everyone working at the site would.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How many guards?<br /><strong>A:</strong> As many as the offeror decides it will take to cover the time period requested. There is only one guard station at the building entrance and it may only take one person to cover it.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What are the prevailing wage rates?<br /><strong>A:</strong> It is up to the offeror to check and determine that they meet them.</p>

UNDERSTANDING WIDE AREA WORKFLOW  READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS TO EXPEDITE ELECTRONIC PAYMENT
 
(a) This contract action for commercial items of supply incorporates DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests.  For the Department of Defense, the MANDATORY method of electronic submission of payment requests is by Wide Area Workflow (WAWF.)  This means that paper invoices are not permitted and will not be processed for payment.  
 
(b) Definitions Important to the WAWF Process
 
Acceptor:  The organization or person designated in block 15 of the SF 1449 (cover page of the purchase request) who accepts the products or services tendered.  The acceptor has a unique DoDAAC (Department of Defense Activity Address Code) shown in the upper right had box of block 15 that must be used to notify the acceptor that an electronic invoice is pending.
 
DoDAAC:  As stated above, an acronym for Department of Defense Activity Address Code.  This code unique to each organization in the Department of Defense.  Knowledge of what DoDAAC codes must be input into WAWF electronic invoices is crucial to the payment process as it alerts the acceptor that an invoice is pending for acceptance and alerts the payment office that a completed action is ready to process for payment.
 
Payment Office: The location of the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) office shown in block 18a of the SF 1449 that will process your electronic invoices.  The payment office also has a unique DoDAAC.
 
(c) Options within WAWF include a combo for supply items,  a 2-in-1 invoice for service contracts and a stand-alone invoice. It is recommended that the use of , stand-alone invoices be avoided.   The matching of stand-alone invoices by DFAS offices requires invoices and receiving reports be separately or individually submitted by the vendor and the receiving activity  and can routinely cause lengthy delays and possible rejection because they do not appear together and therefore must be individually matched and then verified.  The use of the combo or 2-in-1 does not present this problem and avoids the attendant delays associated with matching.  Detailed instructions on how to create an invoice, as well as other topical issues, can be found at the WAWF training website at http://www.wawftraining.com .
 
(d) A key, important, and imperative step for vendors to take is to e-mail notification to the acceptor identified in the contract in block 15 by clicking on the Send More E-Mail Notifications link in WAWF upon submission of the electronic invoice instrument (combo or 2-in1).  This step provides notice to the acceptor of your pending invoice

<DESC>Please note the following question has been answered by the Grantee.
<p><br />Q. Will contractors that work on this feasibility study be precluded by Brazilian law from working on the later VTS implementation projects contracted by Brazil? No mention of such a preclusion is made in the posted RFP. If such a prohibition exists, will USTDA consider granting an extension to the proposal period in order for the bidders to adjust their teams?</p>
<p>A. Although Brazilian public bidding law prohibits a company's participation on both the feasibility study and project implementation, no legal restriction applies in this case because the bidding process was organized outside Brazil by the US government and follows US public tender regulations.</p>

<DESC><p>SUBJECT: FA9422-11-R-0002 AMENDMENT 1 - REVISION<br />NUCLEAR ENTERPRISE TRACKING SYSTEM (NETS)</p>
<p>CS/Phone: Francine M. Chavez / 505-853-2483<br />Date: 06 December 2010</p>
<p>Amendment 1 - Due to changes in the acquisition strategy, we are issuing a revision to Amendment 1. This revision only includes those Requests for Information (RFI's) that are impacted by the strategy change. The RFI numbers where a revision/update occurred will correspond with the original RFI numbers from Amendment 1, dated 27 Oct 10. All other RFI's that did not require revision/update are considered current and have been omitted from this revision</p>
<p>1. RFI RESPONSES</p>
<p>CONTRACTING</p>
<p>RFI #2: Based on the last paragraph of the Statement of Objectives (SOO) para 3.0 ("The offeror's SOW shall specify in clear, understandable terms the work to be done by the contractor in developing or producing the technology demonstration and define what is required in specific performance based, quantitative terms.") our assumption is that the RFP will require Offerors to develop and submit a Statement of Work (SOW) that addresses the information contained in the SOO. This approach provides an excellent opportunity to meet Air Force objectives given that:<br />a. The Offeror developed SOW provides a means of evaluating proposals to determine if the Offeror can satisfy the "outcomes" defined in the SOW.<br />b. The Offeror developed SOW provides a means of determining which Offeror is best positioned to provide the demonstration.</p>
<p>Answer: It is anticipated the final RFP will require a demonstration plan (similar to a SOW) that addresses the information contained in the SOO. The purpose of the plan is for offerors to provide details on their approach to the technology demonstration contract. The content of the plan will be delineated in both the Instructions to Offerors and through a CDRL requirement. A SOW will no longer be required. <br /><br />RFI #4: Our assumption is that the SOW and other deliverables required by the Request for Proposal (RFP) will not allow classified proposals. Is this assumption correct?</p>
<p>Answer: The solicitation will contain a DD254 classified at the Secret level. Proposals will be unclassified.</p>
<p>RFI #5: Our assumption is that a pre-proposal conference will be held that will brief industry on the program and to answer general questions, is this assumption correct?</p>
<p>Answer: Based on the fact the purpose of these contracts is to receive technology demonstrations and they require no knowledge of our current systems or nuclear processes, we will not be conducting an industry day or one-on-one sessions with offerors.</p>
<p>RFI #6: Our assumption is that the Air Force will allow industry to participate in one-on-one meetings with Government contracting and technical representatives. Is this assumption correct?</p>
<p>Answer: Based on the fact the purpose of these contracts is to receive technology demonstrations and they require no knowledge of our current systems or nuclear processes, we will not be conducting an industry day or one-on-one sessions with offerors.</p>
<p>RFI #8: The SOO seems to imply that the contract will be awarded to a single contractor. Has an acquisition strategy been determined indicating the number of awards?</p>
<p>Answer: AFNWC anticipates making several firm-fixed price contract awards, estimated at no more than 10, pursuant to this acquisition depending on the number of fully capable proposals received and availability of funds. The estimated cumulative cost for all contracts awarded is expected to not exceed $3.5 M. Individual contracts shall not exceed $350,000.</p>
<p>RFI #11: Based on the SOO in para. 5.0, Period of Performance ("Proposed by contractors in the Statement of Work"), will the contractor specified periods of performance define the overall period of performance for the Contract?</p>
<p>Answer: The Period of Performance will be no more than 210 days.</p>
<p>RFI #13: Has an acquisition schedule been defined? If so, can you release it to industry?</p>
<p>Answer: The formal RFP will be released no later than 10 Dec 10 with proposals due 10 Jan 11. We anticipate contract award(s) within 30 days after proposal receipt. This of course is dependent on the number of proposals received. The primary proposal submission will consist of the demonstration plan. The demonstration report and development plan will be during the course of the contract. The demonstration report will be due no later than 30 days after the formal technology demonstration. The development plan (a rough order of magnitude including activities, cost and schedule required to further develop the technology) will be required no later than 30 days after the technology demonstration report is delivered.</p>
<p>RFI #14: Has the Air Force determined their budget for this acquisition and can that budget information be shared with the Offerors at this time?</p>
<p>Answer: The AFNWC in support of AFGSC intends to use Research, Development, Test and Engineering (RDT&amp;E) funds for this effort. AFNWC anticipates making several firm-fixed price contract awards, estimated at no more than 10, pursuant to this acquisition depending on the number of fully capable proposals received and availability of funds. The estimated cumulative cost for all contracts awarded is expected not to exceed $3.5 M. Individual contracts shall not exceed $350,000.</p>
<p><br />TECHNICAL</p>
<p>RFI #10: Is there an identified date for the Initial Operating Capability or Full Operational Capability for the demonstrated systems?</p>
<p>Answer: No. There is currently no funding or formal follow-on program requiring operational capability.</p>
<p>RFI #11: Are the Mission Owners and Acquisition Decision Milestone authorities identified for the purpose of certification and accreditation?</p>
<p>Answer: Certification and accreditation is not a contract requirement. Should a follow-on program occur, the appropriate mission owners and acquisition authorities will be identified at that time.</p>
<p>RFI #12: Please describe the Air Force resources, personnel, equipment, data, and data access that will be available during the SOW development period, during program execution.</p>
<p>Answer: None will be provided during the competitive proposal process. Upon contract award, the government will work with each contractor to determine the technology demonstration schedule. AFGSC and AFNWC personnel (approximately 5-10) will attend the technology demonstrations. Between the date of award and the actual demonstrations, AFNWC will publish the rules of engagement for government information exchange.</p>
<p>RFI #13: What provisions are in place to secure access to the identified Air Force Data systems during the demonstration period?</p>
<p>Answer: Since this is not a contract requirement, there will be no access to Air Force data systems.</p>
<p>RFI #14: Will access to SIPRNet via a sponsored contractor SCIF be provided during the Period of Performance of this effort?</p>
<p>Answer: There should be no need to have SIPRNet connectivity or utilize a SCIF.</p>
<p>RFI #16: What portions of capability is already available on the Air Force network?</p>
<p>Answer: Since current knowledge of Air Force systems is not a contract requirement, this information will not be provided.</p>

<p>Amendment 2 is issued in response to Requests for Information (RFI's) received prior to release of the Draft RFP (9 Nov 10).</p>
<p>Contracting</p>
<p>RFI #1: Based on the SOO in Para. 5.0, Period of Performance ("Proposed by contractors in the Statement of Work"), will the contractor specified periods of performance define the overall period of performance for the Contract?</p>

This of course is dependent on the number of proposals received. The primary proposal submission will consist of the demonstration plan. The demonstration report and development plan will be during the course of the contract. The demonstration report will be due no later than 30 days after the formal technology demonstration. The development plan (a rough order of magnitude including activities, cost and schedule required to further develop the technology) will be required no later than 30 days after the technology demonstration report is delivered.</p>
<p>RFI #3: Has the Air Force determined their budget for this acquisition and can that budget information be shared with the Offerors at this time?</p>
<p>Answer: The AFNWC in support of AFGSC intends to use Research, Development, Test and Engineering (RDT&amp;E) funds for this effort. AFNWC anticipates making several firm-fixed price contract awards, estimated at no more than 10, pursuant to this acquisition depending on the number of fully capable proposals received and availability of funds. The estimated cumulative cost for all contracts awarded is expected to not exceed $3.5 M. Individual contracts shall not exceed $350,000.<br />&emsp;<br />Technical</p>
<p>RFI #1: Are the Mission Owners and Acquisition Decision Milestone authorities identified for the purpose of certification and accreditation?</p>
<p>Answer: Certification and accreditation is not a contract requirement. Should a follow-on program occur, the appropriate mission owners and acquisition authorities will be identified at that time.<br /><br />RFI #2: Please describe the Air Force resources, personnel, equipment, data, and data access that will be available during the SOW development period, during program execution.</p>
<p>Answer: None will be provided during the competitive proposal process. Upon contract award, the government will work with each contractor to determine the technology demonstration schedule. AFGSC and AFNWC personnel (approximately 5-10) will attend the technology demonstrations. Between the date of award and the actual demonstrations, AFNWC will publish the rules of engagement for government information exchange.</p>
<p>RFI #3: What provisions are in place to secure access to the identified Air Force Data systems during the demonstration period?</p>
<p>Answer: Since this is not a contract requirement, there will be no access to Air Force data systems.</p>
<p>RFI #4: What portions of capability is already available on the Air Force network?</p>
<p>Answer: Since current knowledge of Air Force systems is not a contract requirement, this information will not be provided.</p>
<p>RFI#5: Do you want to meet FBI and Homeland Security standards on finger prints (ANSI 378, and FIPS 201) - they are all "one of many" and require an area scanner - the area scanner can be MIL STD 810G but may be issues if fingers dirty etc.</p>
<p>Answer: We have no predisposed solution so demonstration of any and all capabilities is acceptable.</p>
<p>RFI#6: Could we use a line scanner? - More rugged and less likely to be screwed up by dirt - but not ANSI 378 data - however will provide positive ID data for number of users (maybe 100) and works well on a portable device.</p>
<p>Answer: We have no predisposed solution so demonstration of any and all capabilities is acceptable.</p>
<p>RFI#7: How do you want to enroll a user - will they use hand held Finger Print reader or another reader and can you provide ANSI 378 standard file?</p>
<p>Answer: We have no predisposed solution so demonstration of any and all capabilities is acceptable.</p>
<p>RFI#8: How many users do you expect per Hand held reader?</p>
<p>Answer: We have no predisposed solution so demonstration of any and all capabilities is acceptable.</p>

<DESC><p><br />SUBJECT: FA9422-11-R-0002 AMENDMENT 3<br />NUCLEAR ENTERPRISE TRACKING SYSTEM (NETS)</p>
<p>CS/Phone: Francine M. Chavez / 505-853-2483<br />Date: 06 December 2010</p>
<p>Amendment 3 is issued in response to questions received regarding the Draft RFP, dated <br />9 Nov 10, and the 23 Nov 10 acquisition strategy change posting on FedBizzOpps.</p>
<p><br />CONTRACTING</p>
<p>RFI #1: Comment: In attachment 3 Addendum to FAR 52.212-01 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (June 2008) there are some inconsistencies with Table 2.2- Proposal Organization (Page 3 of 24) and the written instructions in the rest of this portion of the document. Specifically, the table lists Volume III as the Cost/Price volume and Volume IV as the Relevant Past Performance volume. In the text of the same attachment, (Page 9 of 24) Section 5.0 lists Volume III as Past Performance whereas (Page 11 of 24) Section 6.0 lists Volume IV as Cost/Price. Question: Will the Air Force clarify the ordering of the Volumes for the response in the Final RFP?</p>
<p>Answer: Based on our change in acquisition strategy, Table 2.2 is updated to reflect Vol. III and Instructions to Offerors (ITO) paragraph 5.0 as Cost/Price. Contract documentation becomes Vol. IV and ITO paragraph 6.0. The Past Performance volume is deleted.</p>
<p>RFI#2: Comment: Attachment 3 Addendum to FAR 52.212-01 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (June 2008) Table 2.2 Proposal Organization (Page 4 of 24) lists the Relevant Past Performance as being limited to 3 citations, 5 pages per citation (plus questionnaires). In section 5.3.4 Past Performance Volume Contents the wording is "(3 relevant contracts, limited to 3 pages each)" with no mention of the questionnaire forms. Question: Please provide the corrected requirements for Past Performance citations.</p>
<p>Answer: Past Performance requirements are deleted in their entirety.</p>
<p>RFI#3: Comment: In reference to the Past Performance Volume Contents, section 5.3 Relevant Contracts states that industry is to "...include information on no more than three (3) recent contracts performed by each of your teaming partners and significant subcontractors..."</p>
<p>Question 1: Will these additional relevant contracts be limited to 5 pages per citation plus questionnaires in the same manner as the prime vendors' relevant contracts?</p>
<p>Answer: Past Performance requirements are deleted in their entirety.</p>
<p>Question 2: Is there a limit to the total number of Past Performance contracts (3 for the Prime and 3 for each partner/significant subcontractor)?</p>
<p>Answer: Past Performance requirements are deleted in their entirety.</p>
<p>RFI#4: Comment: In reference to the same section (Past Performance Volume Contents, section 5.3 Relevant Contracts), if the AF's intent that the number of past performance citations for the Prime and any teaming partners be limited to three (3) in total, Praeses respectfully requests that the total be increased to five (5).</p>
<p>Answer: Past Performance requirements are deleted in their entirety.</p>
<p>RFI#5: Question: Organization of CDRLs due at proposal submittal not provided. What are the DiDs for the CDRLs (Demo &amp; Dev Plans)? DI-MGMT-80004(?)</p>
<p>Answer: The CDRLs and corresponding DiDs are presently under construction.</p>
<p>RFI#6: Question: There seems to be a typo. Should section 5.3 refer to Vol III instead of Vol IV?</p>
<p>Answer: Based on our change in acquisition strategy, Table 2.2 is updated to reflect Vol. III and Instructions to Offerors (ITO) paragraph 5.0 as Cost/Price. Contract documentation becomes Vol. IV and ITO paragraph 6.0. The Past Performance volume is deleted.</p>
<p>RFI#7: Question: There seems to be conflicting instructions. Should there be a delivery of all volumes on one CD or one CD per volume?</p>
<p>Answer: All volumes may be placed on a single CD, space permitting, and each volume shall be in a different directory on the CD. Use separate files to permit rapid location of all portions, including subfactors, exhibits, annexes, and attachments, if any. If files are compressed, the necessary decompression program must be included. If there is not adequate space on a single CD then clearly identify on each CD the Volume number(s) located within the CD.</p>
<p>RFI#8: Question: The FedBizOps web page for the NETS solicitation indicates this acquisition is not a set aside, whereas the draft SF 1449 (page 1 of the draft RFP package) indicates this is 100% set aside for a small business. Please clarify which of these is correct.</p>
<p>Answer: Based on change in acquisition strategy, this will be "full and open" competition with preference given to qualified small businesses. Small business proposals will be evaluated first using technically acceptable criteria to rank order them. Contracts will be awarded in succession to all technically qualified small business offerors, dependent on availability of funds. Once the small business list of proposals is exhausted, large business proposals will be evaluated and rank ordered according to the same technically acceptable criteria. Again, contracts will be awarded in succession to all technically qualified offerors, dependent on availability of funds.</p>
<p>RFI#9: Comment: Considering that this solicitation is looking for an existing commercial device that can be modified/updated to provide the desired capabilities in such a short time span, it would be advantageous to the Air Force to release this acquisition as &lsquo;Unrestricted', allowing large businesses with the commensurate internal resources and Quality Assurance/Quality Control capabilities to ensure a successful solution.</p>
<p>Answer: As stated above, based on change in acquisition strategy, this will be "full and open" competition with preference given to qualified small businesses.</p>
<p>RFI#10: Question: Can you please clarify the statements bolded below? If we deliver the development plan after the demonstration, why is the development plan needed, if the demonstration is over? Is this just a simple developmental plan that is something for ya'll to be aware of, if at any time in the future, there may be carried out in another round of funding, which you stated clearly as was not coming?</p>
<p>Answer: Since we do not expect any one contractor will be able to satisfy all product outcomes or objectives, the development plan will explain how the demonstrated technology can be further developed/improved to fulfill the areas the technology demonstration did not address (activities, cost, and schedule). The development plan is in intended to help us to potentially build a requirement should there be follow-on funding.</p>
<p>RFI#11: Question: What is the timeline for "after the receipt of the demo"? Does this mean, we conduct the tech demo and then hand you immediately a rough-order-of-magnitude demo plan? The development plan will be required after receipt of the demonstration vice being due at the time of the proposal. The development plan will be a rough-order of-magnitude on what activities, cost and schedule would be required to further develop the technology.</p>
<p>Answer: The primary proposal submission will consist of the demonstration plan. The demonstration report and development plan will be during the course of the contract. The demonstration report will be due no later than 30 days after the formal technology demonstration. The development plan (a rough order of magnitude including activities, cost and schedule required to further develop the technology) will be required no later than 30 days after the technology demonstration report is delivered. The total period of performance is 210 days.</p>
<p>RFI#12: Question: Does the statement that this contract will be 100% small business set aside mean 100% of the effort must be done by a small business, or just that 100% of the multiple awards will be to small businesses?</p>
<p>Answer: The acquisition will be "full and open" competition with preference given to qualified small businesses. Small businesses must demonstrate performance of 50% or more of the effort in order to be considered qualified and awardable. Large businesses will be considered for award after the small business proposal list has been exhausted.</p>
<p>RFI#13: Question: The current posted statement of objectives (SOO) is dated 22 September 2010 yet we have downloaded another dated 09 November 2010 from a different posting. What is the latest date for the Statement of Objectives?</p>
<p>Answer: Most recently posted version is the SOO, dated 9 Nov 10, posted in the Draft RFP.</p>
<p><br />TECHNICAL</p>
<p>RFI#1: Question: Are these the only requirements for a bio-metrically secure handheld computing device?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, the handheld device will have to demonstrate biometric security to safeguard information but there is no predisposition on a possible solution. Demonstration of any and all capabilities the device can currently perform is acceptable.</p>
<p>RFI#2: Question: What is considered to be "local command and Control"?</p>
<p>Answer: This refers to on-the-scene munitions squadrons, groups, numbered AF, MAJCOMs, COCOMs, etc.</p>
<p>RFI#3: Question: Does the government need visibility into asset location while they are in flight or in transit? TAV 24/7 or something less?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, we have to be able to track when and on what they are associated with. The Air Force in interested in ultimately being able to track any and all components 24/7.</p>
<p>RFI#4: Question: Is the government presently using UID/RFID technologies to track/monitor nuclear assets?</p>
<p>Answer: RFID is not used, unique serial numbering is used.</p>
<p>RFI#5: Question: Is the government looking for Cradle to Grave Total Asset Visibility?</p>
<p>Answer: The Air Force is interested in ultimately being able to track any and all components.</p>
<p>RFI#6: Question: What does the Air Force nuclear enterprise consist of? i.e., Land based as well as Aircraft.</p>
<p>Answer: The Air Force nuclear enterprise consists of a number of weapons systems, nuclear policies, procedures, and processes affecting nuclear operations. This includes the management, sustainment, and logistics of nuclear weapons-related material.</p>
<p>RFI#7: Question: How many items will be an acceptable number for the demonstration?</p>
<p>Answer: We have no predisposed solution so demonstration of any and all capabilities is acceptable. Offerors may demonstrate multiple solutions during their technology demonstration and the demonstration in its entirety shall not exceed a single day.</p>
<p>RFI#8: Question: Does SIPRNET interface well with the AF-GIG? Is the AF-GIG classified?</p>
<p>Answer: Parts of AF-GIG are classified (SIPRNET aspect) so SIPRNET does interface with AF-GIG.</p>
<p>RFI#9: Question: If there a requirement to transmit data from a classified to unclassified (SIPRNET/NIPRNET) environment?</p>
<p>Answer: No</p>
<p>RFI#10: Question: Are the CAS and DIAMONDS systems NOT NOW considered subject to interfacing for the demonstration?</p>
<p>Answer: Correct, there is no requirement to demonstrate CAS and DIAMONDS interface. Demonstrations are to be conducted in a relevant environment at contractor facilities to demonstrate capability offered.</p>
<p>RFI#11: Question: What are the general characteristics of the anticipated/specific &lsquo;Trigger Points' that will send applicable data in the data tracking/monitoring process?</p>
<p>Answer: The general characteristics of the trigger points will be hand-off and transition of accountability from one entity to another (i.e. any movement must be tracked).</p>
<p>RFI#12: Question: What are the existing data systems (and associated detailed characteristics/'Trigger Points') from which the information required to satisfy the "...verify user credentials, personnel reliability status and currency/training qualifications"?</p>
<p>Answer: Since current knowledge of Air Force systems is not a contract requirement, this information will not be provided.</p>
<p>RFI#13: Question: What percentage of nuclear assets is presently marked with UID?</p>
<p>Answer: Since current knowledge of Air Force systems is not a contract requirement, this information will not be provided.</p>
<p>RFI#14: Question: Are nuclear legacy assets being marked during maintenance activities commonly referred to as "Trigger Points"?</p>
<p>Answer: See the answer to RFI#11 above.</p>
<p>RFI#15: Question: Are all assets currently maintained using the Integrated Maintenance Data System (IMDS)?</p>
<p>Answer: Multiple systems are used to include IMDS.</p>
<p>RFI#16: Question: Is the IMDS currently being used to capture UID data/information?</p>
<p>Answer: No, not for all items.</p>
<p>RFI#17: Question: Will all existing/known issues discussed in Para 1.0 of the Instructions to Offerers Attachment be disclosed as part of the final RFP?</p>
<p>Answer: No, based on change in acquisition strategy, this is no longer relevant and it will be deleted from the final RFP.</p>
<p>RFI#18: Question: Please clarify how the Intellectual Property rights for any existing tool/capability that is used as the basis/foundation for the selected IT solution would be protected, ie, remain with the originating company?</p>
<p>Answer: The appropriate intellectual property clauses are currently under consideration and will be clearly delineated in the final RFP.</p>
<p>RFI#19: Comment: Instructions to Offerors, page 23 of 24, paragraph 2, requiring a comment for "...each and every response..." appears extremely burdensome for evaluators to complete; recommend comments for evaluation responses that are B/E (Blue/Exceptional) as well as responses that are R/U (Red/Unsatisfactory).</p>
<p>Answer: Noted.</p>
<p>RFI#20: Comment: The Statement of Objectives included as part of the Draft RFP states in section 6.0 Place of Performance (Page 2 of 2) that the "Performance under contract will take place at contractor facilities." Question: Will the AF allow the contractor to conduct necessary requirements gathering at Barksdale AFB, Louisiana, to ensure the best alignment of the demonstration's functionality with the needs of the end users and other interested parties?</p>
<p>Answer: Since current knowledge is not required, there will be no access to Air Force personnel or facilities during the competitive proposal process. AFGSC and AFNWC personnel (approximately 5-10) will attend the technology demonstrations. Between the date of award and the actual demonstrations, AFNWC will publish the rules of engagement for government information exchange during the demonstration.</p>
<p>RFI#21: Question: Paragraph 3.0 Objectives of the 09 Nov SOO states: "Contractor technology demonstrations shall provide a system that decreases data input time, increases data reliability, increases security, reduces transcription issues, improves reporting timeliness, and improves command and control while supporting the Air Force's nuclear enterprise". Would you please explain further what is meant by increasing data reliability?</p>
<p>Answer: Increasing data reliability refers to: ..."the accuracy and completeness of computer processed data, given to intended purposes for use. Computer-processed data include data (1) entered into a computer system and (2) resulting from computer processing. Computer-processed data can vary in form from electronic files to tables in published reports".</p>
<p>RFI#22: Question: Paragraph 3.1.3 of the 09 November 2010 SOO states: "Demonstrate which of the following capabilities your technology currently addresses:" Subparagraph 3.1.3.3 further states: "Ability to continuously download, store, upload, view, report and print data to a secure portal and data repository". Does the word "print data to" mean "print data from" (i.e., has a command to send to printer), or does it mean to otherwise send/transmit/publish?</p>
<p>Answer: Good point. Should be "print data from"...</p>

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT FOR BASIC COMPLIANCE AUDITING
NO PHONE CALLS PLEASE.  ALL QUESTIONS MUST BE IN WRITING AND EITHER MAILED, FAXED OR EMAILED TO THE CONTRACTING OFFICER.  CONTACT INFORMATION BELOW.
This is a market survey for Basic Compliance Auditing Training.  The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.  Therefore, any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendor's expense.  
At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.
The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, 8(a) certified firms, and all other business types and sizes, capable of providing specified Basic Compliance Auditing.
This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.  
The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is  541990, All Other Porfessional, Scientific, and Technical Services, with a size standard of $7 million.  
Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable.
In order to make the determination, the FAA requires the following from interested vendors:

<DESC><p>Smithsonian institution is issuing&nbsp;a request for proposal for a Construction Management at Risk Contract (CMc) for the construction of the NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY AND CULTURE (NMAAHC). The proposed contract listed here is UNRESTRICTED. All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a proposal, which will be considered by the Smithsonian. The new NMAAHC museum will be constructed on the National Mall near the Washington Monument in Washington, DC. The site is approximately five acres in area and bounded by Constitution Avenue and Madison Drive, Fourteenth and Fifteenth Streets, NW. The site will be developed with landscaping and improvements to be used for outdoor museum programs in a manner consistent with its context and contributing to a National Historic Landmark on the National Mall. The facility program calls for a new museum building of approximately 330,000 gross square feet which will be a place of collaboration with museums and other organizations to promote the study and appreciation of African American life and its impact on the nation and the world. The new museum will include exhibition galleries, performance and public program spaces, a theater, food service, and retail. Non-public spaces will include a loading dock, collections handling and work rooms, administrative offices, and support spaces. The design will incorporate state-of the-art technologies for exhibits, research, and communications, and the new facility is planned to achieve LEED Gold certification. The Smithsonian anticipates awarding a contract for pre-construction services by mid 2011 and commencing of site preparation activity in late 2011. The Smithsonian expects contractor turnover of the building for the installation of exhibits starting in late 2014 and the new museum will open to the public in November 2015 to coincide with symbolic moments in the narrative of American history.</p>
<p>The selected CMc shall provide Pre-construction Phase Services and Construction Phase Services through a guaranteed maximum price (GMP) agreement. Total period of performance including Pre-construction and Construction is estimated to be from notice to proceed in April 2011 to substantial completion in November 2014. The estimated construction cost is between $240,000,000 and $290,000,000. Critical elements of the work include, but are not limited to; pre-construction services, site work, utility work, excavation, sheeting &amp; shoring (slurry wall), foundations, dewatering, concrete and steel super-structure, landscape and hardscape, high level architectural finishes (both interior and exterior), MEP systems, elevators, roofing, exterior curtain wall with unique fa&ccedil;ade treatment, food service equipment, and theater specialties. Additional requirements for performance include: procedures and documentation to ensure compliance with the established LEED building criteria; practices, procedures and documentation related to integrated building commissioning; and knowledge of procedures for the use of BIM.</p>
<p>Firm evaluation and selection will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 15, Best Value Procurement, utilizing a two-step procurement model. Step I of the RFP will consist of a list of prequalifying criteria to assist the agency in identifying those CMc contractors that have demonstrated past specialized experience in comparable and non-comparable CMc projects and other relevant qualifying factors. It is the Smithsonian's intent to advance the most highly qualified companies for further consideration under Step II, technical and pricing evaluation of the RFP. Companies which are advanced to Step II of the RFP will be evaluated in accordance with the technical criteria as set forth in the RFP</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) for this procurement is 236220 and the size standard under this code is $33.5 million average annual receipts over the last three years.

<DESC>EVEAH A&A Support Services RFI Questions and Answers (Q&A)

1.   Are the five focus areas for FY10 cited on pg. 2 of the PWS still the same focus areas for FY11?  If not, what are the changes?
 
EVEAH's priorities for FY11remain the five focus areas described in the PWS.  "Five focus areas for FY10 are: proactive outreach efforts, system redesign efforts, strategies targeting Veterans residing in rural areas, strategies targeting women Veterans, and transportation for immobilized and remote Veterans.  Overall accountability for the EVEAH initiative rests with the Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Health (PDUSH) and the Office of Healthcare Transformation (OHT)."
 
2.   The PWS' Section 4.1 states that "most of the [contractor's] efforts will be performed at the contractor's facilities."  What approximate percentage of this work effort matches with "most?"
 
The Government estimates approximately 80 percent of the contractor's efforts will be performed at the contractor's facilities.  This number represents the overall EVEAH program, with individual projects varying.
 
3.   The PWS' Section 4.2 states "Include estimated travel costs in your firm-fixed price line items."  Can the VA provide some baseline information to help bidders calculate the estimated travel costs as part of their firm-fixed price submissions?
 
Industry is reminded that this is a request for information only not a request for proposals.  When the RFP is released the Government will provide an estimated number of trips for travel costs.
 
4.   The PWS' Section 5.1.6 a) states that "The Contractor shall maintain a structured repository for Government and Contractor developed official program documentation."  Does this repository already exist and if so, can the VA provide some information about this repository?
 
EVEAH projects utilize a SharePoint infrastructure provided by OI&T.
 
5.   The RFI instructions for "Section 2" imply that if a company is a small business, then it is required to have a "Section 2" in its RFI response.  Likewise, if a company is not a small business, then it is not required to submit a "Section 2."  Should a non-small business, in its RFI response, provide a "Section 2" page with the only text on that page being "Not applicable?"  Regardless of a company's size, should the "Section 2" page still include Business size, DUNS number, CAGE Code, and NAICS information?  Can the VA please clarify how it wants this section addressed based on these questions?
 
Non-small businesses are not required to provide any information listed in section 2.

The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>

<DESC>Purchase of a&nbsp;high density genotyping assay, known as the Infinium assay, developed by Illumina which allows thousands of different DNA markers to be analyzed in 48 individuals in a single reaction assay, thus, permitting a large amount of data to be generated in a short period of time. The Biosciences Research Laboratory has been using Illumina's reagents to perform similar genotyping experiments in the previous four years with success. The Biosciences Research Laboratory recently initiated a collaborative project with barley scientists from various institutions in the US and in Europe with a plan to genotype 9,000 DNA markers on 3,312 US barley lines. These markers are custom designed and included in the high density bead chip kit along with other chemical reagents manufactured by Illumina. Illumina, a large business, is the sole manufacturer of these kits. The equipment necessary to perform these assays is already available in at the Biosciences Research Laboratory in Fargo, North Dakota, and a large invest amount investment has already been made in Illumina products (approximately $300K) to equip our lab for conducting these assays. Moreover, by using the same assay system, the data consistency will allow us to compare and share results with our European colleagues.

<DESC>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with CT Corporation System, 111 18th Avenue, 13th Floor, New York, New York, 10011, for continued hosting and use of the CaseVault case management web collaboration tool. The modification to existing commercial purchase order Tcc-10-HQ-C-0016 will increase the ceiling of the purchase order to allow for use of the services through 7/1/2011, at a level reflective of actual use over the past year. The estimated award amount is $350,000. The purchase order was initially awarded on a sole-source basis to CT Corp after extensive market research determined that no other source offered the technical capability and experience for direct integration with iBlaze software from CT Summation. CaseVault is currently supporting litigation cases for the OCC and continued use of CaseVault is required so as not to disrupt current activities. There are currently more than 3 million pages loaded into the system. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; a solicitation document will not be issued. All information received within 15 days after the date of this notice with pricing and sufficient technical documentation to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirement will be considered by the OCC.
