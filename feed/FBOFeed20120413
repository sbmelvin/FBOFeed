<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory (NPPTL), Surveillance, Communication and Scientific Support, hereby announces its intent to issue a purchase order to Adele Lynn Leadership Group to Facilitate a Cultural Change Training Effort for the National Personal Protective Technology Lab.
<p>BACKGROUND AND SCOPE:</p>
<p>Organizational culture is the collective behavior of people that are part of an organization, it is also formed by the organization's values, visions, norms, working language, systems, and symbols, it includes beliefs and habits. It is also the pattern of such collective behaviors and assumptions that are taught to new organizational members as a way of perceiving, and even thinking and feeling. Organizational culture affects the way people and groups interact with each other and with stakeholders. Changing an organization's culture is one of the most difficult leadership challenges.</p>
<p>Changing a culture is a large-scale undertaking, and eventually all of the organizational tools for changing minds will need to be put in play. That's because an organization's culture comprises an interlocking set of goals, roles, processes, values, communications practices, attitudes and assumptions. The elements fit together as a mutually reinforcing system and combine to prevent any attempt to change it. That's why it's important to address the issues early through effective training of staff.</p>
<p>NIOSH/National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory (NPPTL) located in Pittsburgh, PA is currently undergoing some substantial changes due mostly to retiring senior staff and diminishing and constraining budgets</p>
<p>PURPOSE:.<br />The purpose of this acquisition is to obtain facilitation services for a culture change management undertaking for NIOSH, National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory (NPPTL). Consultation will provide a customized series of consulting, facilitation and training sessions for the organization that will provide change leaders the tools and information they need to create change in NPPTL.</p>
<p>TASKS TO BE PERFORMED:</p>
<p>In collaboration with NIOSH/NPPTL, the contractor will perform the following tasks:<br />1. Develop a plan to integrate change management into NPPTL<br />a. Review current and future change status for the lab<br />b. Establish a steering committee to facilitate change<br />c. Work with steering committee to define vision for improving culture and teamwork within the lab<br />2. Establish an effective approach to engage employees in the change initiative<br />3. Evaluate the change initiative and provide suggestions for improvements<br />a. Revisit and refine measures<br />b. Look for positives - coaching and reinforcement<br />c. Help define and recognize short term wins<br />d. Provide assessment of training initiative and recommendations for moving forward</p>
<p>Location of Performance: The primary location for the performance of work under this contract shall be at the NIOSH/NPPTL facility in Pittsburgh, PA.</p>
<p><br />MINIMUM VENDOR QUALIFICATIONS</p>
<p>1. Contractor must show knowledge of the NPPTL culture and change environment.<br />2. Contractor must demonstrate experience in providing the requested tasks with organizations to develop and maintain essential leadership and team building skills with all employees.<br />3. Contractor must demonstrate the ability to adjust training methods to meet organizational needs, with an emphasis on the ability to build trust in the culture and build emotional intelligence with the staff.</p>
<p>Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written item description/item characteristics and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward the item description and pricing information to Margaret L. Mooney, CDC NIOSH, 626 Cochrans Mill Road, Pittsburgh, PA 15236, Reference 2012-Q-14499.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Division of Reproductive Health intends to award a fixed price sole source purchase order to National Association for Public health Statistics and Information Systems (NAPHSIS), 962 Wayne Ave Ste 701, Silver Spring, MD 20910-4475.
<p>CDC intends to procure services using simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13, utilizing the sole source authority under FAR 13.106-1(b).<br />The anticipated performance period is one year. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 813920<br />with a standard size of $14.0 million.</p>
<p>CDC requires the vendor to administer a short survey to all 52 jurisdictions (the 50 states, DC, and New York City) to understand the status of birth certificate and hospital discharge linkages in the United States. Only NAPHSIS has direct relationships with the vital registrars in the state health departments. Birth certificate or administrative hospital discharge data alone is not sufficient to address surveillance of pregnancy conditions, risk behavior, and neonatal outcomes because birth certificate information lacks detailed complication data, hospital discharge information, gestational age and other variables, such as body mass index, gestational weight gain, and smoking. Therefore, linked vital records and hospital discharge data provide the only approach in examining contributions of pregnancy complications to known modifiable risk factors and to monitor national trends.</p>
<p>CDC is not requesting competitive proposals and no solicitation is available. Firms that believe they can provide the services required are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer no later than April 20, 2012 at 1:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST).</p>

<p>1.0 Introduction</p>
<p>The Office of Acquisitions and Grants Management (OAGM) in support of CPI is seeking information regarding a requirement for FBI Channeler and Non-channeler services to conduct fingerprint based background checks described in the attached draft Statement of Work (SOW)/ Performance Work Statement (PWS). The purpose of this notice is to obtain information from industry regarding this potential requirement and to obtain feedback from industry in response to requirements described in the Draft Statement of Work (Draft SOW/PWS) transmitted with this notice. <br />More information about the FBI Channeler requirements can be obtained at the link provided below: <br />http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/background-checks/fbi-approved-channelers<br />1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. Further, at this time, CMS is not seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondees are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future procurement is conducted. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.<br />2.0 Background<br />The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) is pursuing an aggressive National Fraud Prevention Program (NFPP) focused on prevention and detection that is integrated, risk-based, and measurable. The CMS Center for Program Integrity (CPI) created in April 2010 is accountable for strengthening existing program integrity activities for the prevention and detection of fraud, waste, and abuse in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and Children's Health Insurance Program. <br />The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Pub. L. 111-149), as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Pub. L. 111-152) (collectively known as the Affordable Care Act or ACA) makes a number of changes to the Medicare program that enhance provider and supplier enrollment process to improve the integrity of the program to reduce fraud, waste and abuse. CMS implemented certain provisions of ACA to establish additional screening requirements for providers and suppliers. The CMS Rule (72 FR 5862) published February 2, 2011 (http://federalregister.gov/a/2011-1686) implemented at 42 CFR &sect;424.518(c)(2)(B) requires certain owners of providers and suppliers designated to the high level of screening undergo fingerprint-based criminal background check. Based on the current definitions, fingerprint-based screening will impact the initial enrollments of providers/suppliers of Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics/Orthotics &amp; Supplies (DMEPOS) and home health agencies (HHA), and providers/suppliers coming back into the Medicare fee-for-service program from a moratoria status.<br />2.1 Purpose and Objectives <br />CPI is anticipates obtaining services under a single contract to manage collection of fingerprint records on a nationwide basis, to submit fingerprints and receive criminal history record information (CHRI) furnished by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and to review the CHRI for violations of Medicare provider and supplier enrollment requirements and policy that might support CMS's denial or revocation of provider/supplier enrollment. The contractor must be able to handle approximately 50,000 fingerprint-based checks annually. <br />The FBI limits exchange of criminal history records through approved channelers (contractors) who are granted access to FBI record systems. This CMS acquisition includes two functions. <br />&bull; A channeler function to collect and submit fingerprints and receive criminal history record information (CHRI) furnished by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and <br />&bull; A non-channeler function to securely receive and store CHRI to meet CMS recordkeeping requirements, to review and interpret CHRI reports and assign a pass/fail recommendation based on CMS enrollment regulations and guidance.</p>
<p>Both functions are subject to FBI's outsourcing standards and security policy for handling CHRI data and as described in the attached Draft Statement of Work. Contractors intending to provide channeler services must be approved by the FBI to channel fingerprint data to the FBI and obtain CHRI for an authorized recipient (CMS) and authorized purpose. <br />Contractors without this approval or without teaming arrangements with entities that have this approval will not qualify for award.<br />More specific data on the requirement is provided in the draft SOW as an attachment.</p>
<p>2.2 Delivery Period:<br />Services to be provided will be required for either a 4 or 5 year period from date of contract award. Estimated timeframe for contract award is December 2012 to February 2013.<br />2.3 Limitations:<br />Currently, there are no limitations associated with this effort; however, as a result of continued market research the government reserves the right to set aside either a portion or all of this effort for small business.<br />2.4 Security Requirements:<br />As stated earlier both functions (channeler and non-channeler) are subject to FBI's outsourcing standards and security policy for handling CHRI data and as described in the attached Draft Statement of Work. <br />2.5 Project Business/Technical/Performance Requirements</p>
<p>Please refer to the attached Draft Statement of Work and additional reference documents which are provided for industry comment and feedback. <br />3.0 Requested Information:<br />Interested vendors are requested to provide an RFI response that includes comments on the Draft Statement of Work and focuses on the questions provided below. The information gained from this RFI will be used for CMS internal use and consideration: <br />1. What challenges do you see in meeting the CMS requirement to deliver nationwide coverage for fingerprint collection? What are the standard industry methods for collecting fingerprints on a nationwide scale? What customer support methods are standard for this type of effort to help individuals locate the nearest fingerprint location, e.g. website, 1-800 call center, help desk? <br />2. Is it feasible to require that individuals pay for their fingerprint collection, and that CMS only reimburse the contractor for the CHRI and fitness recommendation as described in the Draft SOW requirement? <br />3. Do you see any challenges with meeting the CMS requirement to collect the identity of the individual being fingerprinted (Name, DOB, SSN, Address) and to electronically, secure, retain and pass this identity information to CMS? <br />4. Do you see any challenge with the CMS requirement to hold fingerprints for up to 365 days before transmitting to FBI? <br />5. Based on guidance from FBI CJIS, CMS understands that the Channeler is required to pass the CHRI through the Authorized Recipient (CMS) before it is accessed and stored by a Non Channeler. How is this FBI requirement generally met? What is the most efficient manner to pass the CHRI from the Channeler to CMS and the Non Channeler? What recommendations would you make to improve the requirement described in Section 5.3 of the Draft SOW? <br />6. Do all CHRI output files require manual review to make a fitness recommendation? Can automated methods be used (for instance, to report when no criminal record is found for an individual)? What circumstances impact whether manual review versus automated review is possible when making a fitness recommendation? <br />7. How long does it take to make a fitness recommendation when the CHRI has final dispositions on an individual's criminal record? <br />8. How long does it take to search for final disposition information that is not found on the CHRI? What sources do you use to fill in missing disposition information? What are the average costs or level of effort associated with each case worked under this task?<br />9. What is the standard industry practice for communicating an unfavorable finding in the CHRI? Do you send a written communication on behalf of the Authorized Recipient to the individual with information about the findings?<br />10. Upon reviewing the attached Draft SOW, what are the main variables/factors considered when making a determination to bid or not to bid (i.e., CLIN structure, contract type, contract length, subcontracting goals, socio-economic programs, incentives, period of performance, contract historical data). What should the Government consider: <br />a. To enhance competition?<br />b. To increase Small Business participation?<br />c. To reduce costs?<br />d. To acquire the appropriate skill mix?<br />e. To maximize understanding and to clarify tasking?<br />f. What recommendations should be considered to ensure the objectives and outcomes are clearly identified?<br />g. To maximize the use&nbsp;of&nbsp;Firm Fixed Price?<br />11. What percentages of the various small business socio-economic categories (e.g., Veteran Owned, 8-a, Hubzone, etc.) are achievable in specific tasking areas and/or overall? What tasking would small business be most able to perform?<br />12. If you are currently providing these services to any Government agencies could you please provide the contract number and contact information for the Contracting Officer Representative?<br />4.0 Responses<br />4.1 Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI with a white paper.

<p>1.0 Introduction</p>
<p>The Office of Acquisitions and Grants Management (OAGM) in support of CPI is seeking information regarding a requirement for FBI Channeler and Non-channeler services to conduct fingerprint based background checks described in the attached draft Statement of Work (SOW)/ Performance Work Statement (PWS). The purpose of this notice is to obtain information from industry regarding this potential requirement and to obtain feedback from industry in response to requirements described in the Draft Statement of Work (Draft SOW/PWS) transmitted with this notice. <br />More information about the FBI Channeler requirements can be obtained at the link provided below: <br />http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/background-checks/fbi-approved-channelers<br />1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. Further, at this time, CMS is not seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondees are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future procurement is conducted. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.<br />2.0 Background<br />The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) is pursuing an aggressive National Fraud Prevention Program (NFPP) focused on prevention and detection that is integrated, risk-based, and measurable. The CMS Center for Program Integrity (CPI) created in April 2010 is accountable for strengthening existing program integrity activities for the prevention and detection of fraud, waste, and abuse in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and Children's Health Insurance Program. <br />The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Pub. L. 111-149), as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Pub. L. 111-152) (collectively known as the Affordable Care Act or ACA) makes a number of changes to the Medicare program that enhance provider and supplier enrollment process to improve the integrity of the program to reduce fraud, waste and abuse. CMS implemented certain provisions of ACA to establish additional screening requirements for providers and suppliers. The CMS Rule (72 FR 5862) published February 2, 2011 (http://federalregister.gov/a/2011-1686) implemented at 42 CFR &sect;424.518(c)(2)(B) requires certain owners of providers and suppliers designated to the high level of screening undergo fingerprint-based criminal background check. Based on the current definitions, fingerprint-based screening will impact the initial enrollments of providers/suppliers of Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics/Orthotics &amp; Supplies (DMEPOS) and home health agencies (HHA), and providers/suppliers coming back into the Medicare fee-for-service program from a moratoria status.<br />2.1 Purpose and Objectives <br />CPI is anticipates obtaining services under a single contract to manage collection of fingerprint records on a nationwide basis, to submit fingerprints and receive criminal history record information (CHRI) furnished by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and to review the CHRI for violations of Medicare provider and supplier enrollment requirements and policy that might support CMS's denial or revocation of provider/supplier enrollment. The contractor must be able to handle approximately 50,000 fingerprint-based checks annually. <br />The FBI limits exchange of criminal history records through approved channelers (contractors) who are granted access to FBI record systems. This CMS acquisition includes two functions. <br />&bull; A channeler function to collect and submit fingerprints and receive criminal history record information (CHRI) furnished by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and <br />&bull; A non-channeler function to securely receive and store CHRI to meet CMS recordkeeping requirements, to review and interpret CHRI reports and assign a pass/fail recommendation based on CMS enrollment regulations and guidance.</p>
<p>Both functions are subject to FBI's outsourcing standards and security policy for handling CHRI data and as described in the attached Draft Statement of Work. Contractors intending to provide channeler services must be approved by the FBI to channel fingerprint data to the FBI and obtain CHRI for an authorized recipient (CMS) and authorized purpose. <br />Contractors without this approval or without teaming arrangements with entities that have this approval will not qualify for award.<br />More specific data on the requirement is provided in the draft SOW as an attachment.</p>
<p>2.2 Delivery Period:<br />Services to be provided will be required for either a 4 or 5 year period from date of contract award. Estimated timeframe for contract award is December 2012 to February 2013.<br />2.3 Limitations:<br />Currently, there are no limitations associated with this effort; however, as a result of continued market research the government reserves the right to set aside either a portion or all of this effort for small business.<br />2.4 Security Requirements:<br />As stated earlier both functions (channeler and non-channeler) are subject to FBI's outsourcing standards and security policy for handling CHRI data and as described in the attached Draft Statement of Work. <br />2.5 Project Business/Technical/Performance Requirements</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Office of Science Policy (OSP), intends to solicit, negotiate, and award a contract on a non-competitive, sole source basis to the National Academy of Sciences,500 Fifth St., NW, Washington, DC 20001 for the purpose of performing In-depth studies which may focus on either issues of topical interest or long-range concerns of the biomedical research community and will result in specific findings and recommendations to the NIH, Congressionally mandated studies or reviews, Policy reviews, Evaluation studies and program assessments, surveys on topics of specific interest to the NIH, and conferences, symposia, seminars, or workshops on either general area of interest or specific issues of concern to the NIH. The NIH, OSP, intends to award an NIH-wide IDIQ Cost Reimbursement Task Order contract for a five (5) year period. National Academy of Sciences (NAS) is the sole source for this requirement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (Only One Responsible Source) because of the below:
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The previous task order contract (N01-OD-4-2139, September 1994 with a series of renewals through February 2012) was issued under Other than Full and Open Competition to NAS. Long-standing and well-established Forums, Roundtables, Boards, and core support essential to the NIH mission continue to operate under NAS' leadership and guidance.</p>
<p>The Director of the NIH and/or its various Institutes and Centers often have a need for the expertise of the Academy, utilizing its subcomponents, the National Research Council (NRC) and the Institute of Medicine (IOM) for study of biomedical issues within a specified timeframe and may be congressionally mandated. The various subcomponents of the Academy represent the best collective expertise available in areas of concern. As an honorific society of distinguished scholars engaged in scientific and engineering research, they are able to bring the highest caliber of scientific and technical capabilities, prestige, independence, and objectivity, all of which are essential to acceptance of the study findings and recommendations by the public and the scientific community and handle NIH's high volume of work.</p>
<p>NAS was established by an Act of Congress signed by President Lincoln in March 1863 which calls upon the NAS to "investigate, examine, experiment, and report upon any subject of science or art" whenever called upon to do so by any department of the Government. It has special standing per FAR 6.302-5. A standing contract with the Academy helps NIH to address congressional mandates quickly.</p>
<p>Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all capability statements received within 15 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Responders should provide five (5) copies of their capability statement to Susan Apter (Ref. NIHOD2012326), National Institutes of Health, Office of Acquisitions, 6011 Executive Blvd., Room 537C (MSC 7663) Bethesda, MD 20892-7663. If you are using a courier service, Federal Express or UPS the city, state, and zip code should read Rockville, MD 20852). Please be aware that the U.S. Postal Service's "Express Mail" <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>DOES NOT</strong></span> deliver to the Rockville, Maryland address <strong>AND</strong> delivery to the Bethesda, Maryland address will result in delayed delivery to our office in Rockville, MD (up to 3-5 days).&nbsp; ALL INFORMATION MUST BE RECEIVED ON OR BEFORE THE CLOSING DATE. THE CLOSING DATE FOR RESPONSES IS <strong>Friday, April 27 at 12:00 pm (NOON) Eastern Time.</strong> Email and facsimile copies will not be accepted.</p>

<SUBJECT>Designing and Implementing of Electronic Resource Negotiation Tool for D&MT
<SOLNBR>SGN22170
<RESPDATE>042712
<CONTACT>Laurie A. Snyder, Subcontract Administrator, Phone 303-275-4624, Email laurie.snyder@nrel.gov
<DESC><strong>I. Background<br /></strong><br />The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is a matrixed organization, meaning the projects can extend through several centers, with program managers directing the work and the funding, and centers managing the staff. This creates a dilemma of resource coverage, as staff could easily get over- or under-subscribed during planning. The Deployment and Market Transformation (D&amp;MT) directorate needs to address this issue with a negotiation process that is intended to take place ahead of any plans being formalized. For the latter, D&amp;MT has a formal set of tools and processes. However, to support the negotiation process, an electronic tool, desirably web-based, is needed that has the following functionality:<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Resource Negotiation Steps<br /></span>1. Program and project managers select staff based on competencies they need for their projects;<br />2. Line managers either approve assignments for their staff made in Step 1 or assign alternative staff who could work on the project at specific levels;<br />3. Line managers view the work planned for all of their staff so they can juggle workload and re-balance priorities.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The tool's purpose is to:<br /></span>&bull; Enable dialogue between line and program/project management prior to when the formal staff plans are put together<br />&bull; Foster the negotiation process based on competencies<br />Further detail is provided below under Section III. Requirements. <br /><br /><strong>II. Objective<br /></strong><br />This Sources Sought notice seeks to identify individuals or organizations that have the required expertise to design and develop the electronic resource negotiation tool for a matrixed organization. If applicable, the response should identify an existing tool or tools that could be leveraged to create a resource negotiation process. Specifically the response should discuss the capabilities of existing tools as well as the level of customization required to perform the following basic tasks, at a minimum:<br /><br />1. Allow a project manager to select resources or a set of capabilities for the project;<br />2. Assign hours to selected resources or competencies;<br />3. Allow staff managers to accept or reject resources as planned;<br />4. Allow staff managers to recommend alternative resources;<br />5. Allow staff managers to assign resources with desired competencies to the project and to move projects between resources; and<br />6. Allow staff managers to view staff time commitments and availability by month.<br /><br />In addition, the sources sought response should provide information as to how the tool can meet the more detailed requirements found in the requirements section below. <br /><strong><br />III. REQUIREMENTS<br /></strong><br />The response shall provide a matrix as to the capability for the proposed tool to accomplish each of the following requirements by stating that the requirement is possible, is not possible, or requires customization. <br /><br />1. Easy To Use Electronic Tool<br /><br />2. Enables Collaboration&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Supports multiple logins<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Allows different assignable permissions/privileges<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Allows shared view on demand (i.e. ability to "invite" another user to view a proposal) <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Supports workflow and notifications functions<br /><br />3. Supports Mapping <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) By selecting a competency, one can view the list of individuals who list it in their profiles and vice versa - by selecting an individual one can view a list of competencies they possess. Conversely, by starting with a staff member possessing a wide range of competencies and de-selecting some of them, the tool will display progressively more individuals. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Enables building and editing custom profiles for staff members using multiple competencies <br /><br />4. Supports Down-Selection and Bidding Processes<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Enables central repository function that keeps track of available competencies (and enables narrowing down to fewer and fewer individuals - as assignments are made). This is envisioned to be similar to "filtering" web services like cars.com where multiple filters can be applied as users narrow down their search <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Enables managers to run a report from central repository to see assignments and resource reservations month-to-month and allows for reprioritization (or force-prioritize)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Supports notes <br /><br />5. Supports Aggregation, Reporting and Export<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Allows to search by competency and export found list of individuals<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Reporting: Allows graphical mapping of requests made and the full time equivalent (FTE) availability (e.g. radar plots)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Provides an "unassigned report" that can be exported for external negotiations <br /><br />6. Supports Basic Calculations <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Allows to select units by competency (hours /FTE-Months) and supports easy conversion back and forth <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Allows the summation of units by competency by individual, and the creation of subtotals <br /><br />7. Supports potential integration with the existing NREL Enterprise system (Hyperion) - Optional
<p><strong>IV. EXPERTISE<br /></strong><br />Organizations or individuals responding to this Sources Sought Notice must possess some or all of the following capabilities, attributes, and skills, and must specifically address the activity(ies) to which their qualifications best apply:</p>
<p>1. Demonstrated knowledge of search engine development for filtering through large sets of data; demonstrated ability in code writing.<br />2. Demonstrated knowledge developing technical solutions for human resources management within a complex matrixed environment.<br />3. Demonstrated knowledge in databases (Oracle, Informix, Access, FileMaker Pro, etc.).<br />4. Demonstrated access to, understanding of, and experience with open source.</p>
<p><strong>V. RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS<br /></strong><br />The response to this Sources Sought Notice is limited to four (4) pages of single-spaced text of 12-point font, with minimum 1-inch margins. Brevity is encouraged. All responses shall directly address the Qualifications listed above.</p>
<p>All responses shall be submitted in writing via e-mail to SGN22170@nrel.gov.<br />Electronic format of the response shall be in Microsoft Word or Excel, or converted to Portable Document Format (.pdf). Electronic files in excess of 10MB will not be accepted.</p>

<DESC>ICE is the principal investigative arm of DHS and the second largest investigative agency in the Federal Government. The ICE Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) directorate is a critical asset in the ICE mission, responsible for investigating a wide range of domestic and international activities arising from the illegal movement of people and goods into, within, and out of the United States.
<p>The HSI Forensic Laboratory (HSI-FL) is the only U.S. crime laboratory specializing in the scientific authentication and research of travel and identity documents and related issues. HSI-FL provides a broad range of forensic, intelligence, and investigative support services for ICE, DHS, and many other U.S. and foreign law enforcement agencies. HSI-FL currently uses two legacy commercial-off-the shelf (COTS) systems, the Imaged Documents and Exemplars Library (IDEAL) and the Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) to conduct its operations. IDEAL is a general reference system that is used to manage the variety of documents in the HSI-FL library. IDEAL catalogues and keeps track of all the documents and the system provides an efficient tool to determine if the library has a genuine document exemplar on file to assist in forensics investigations. LIMS is a case management product used to conduct a variety of activities including recording and tracking evidence, preparing reports, and maintaining case related data. The government is in need of a single application to replace both systems. However, appropriate consideration will be given to separate applications as well.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this special notice is to conduct market research for the maintenance of existing National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) NanoFab equipment (fabrication and processing tools). Maintenance includes services and replacement parts. Industry is encouraged to participate in NISTs market research as outlined in this notice. Additional information about NIST and the NanoFab may be found at: <br />&bull; http://www.nist.gov<br />&bull; http://www.nist.gov/cnst/
<p>NOTE: This is NOT a "bidder's conference" and this announcement is not a contract, request for proposal, a promise to contract or a commitment of any kind. The Government will not assume liability for costs incurred by any vendor for presentations, travel, marketing efforts or data offered for examination, therefore, the cost of preparing information in response to this notice is not considered an allowable direct charge to the Government.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) mission is to promote U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve our quality of life. NIST's core competencies are in the areas of measurement science, Rigorous traceability, and development and use of standards.</p>
<p>Within NISTs Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST), the NanoFab provides researchers from industry, academia, NIST, and other government agencies rapid access to a comprehensive suite of tools and processes for nanofabrication and measurement. The facility is a unique national resource, combining easy access, tool and process development, and training, while providing researchers from across the nation access to NIST-wide expertise in nanoscience and nanotechnology. The facility is accessible through a simple application process designed to get users into the facility in a few weeks. The NanoFab is a 60,000 square foot (5600 m2) facility that includes a 19,000 square foot (1800 m2), class 1000 cleanroom, with 8,000 square feet (750 m2) at class 100, along with additional high-performance laboratories nearby within the Advanced Measurement Laboratory complex. There are over 65 fabrication and processing tools in the cleanroom, including tools for electron beam-, photo- and nanoimprint-lithography, laser writing and mask generation, field emission scanning electron microscopy, metal deposition, plasma etching, chemical vapor deposition, atomic layer deposition, and silicon micro/nano-machining. Tools outside the cleanroom include a second electron beam lithography system, a second atomic force microscope, three dual beam focused ion beam systems and a transmission electron microscope. With an unusual level of operational flexibility, it can accommodate the needs of a wide range of researchers, from novices to the world's experts in nanofabrication.</p>
<p>NIST has an ongoing challenge for the replacement of parts for the equipment (fabrication and processing tools) within the NanoFab. The NanoFab currently holds equipment manufactured by the following vendors:</p>
<p>1 4 Wave Inc.<br />2 Accu-seal<br />3 AMMT<br />4 Angstrom Sun<br />5 APT<br />6 ASML<br />7 Brewer Science<br />8 Bruker<br />9 CETR<br />10 Dektak<br />11 Denton<br />12 Disco<br />13 FEI<br />14 Filmetrics<br />15 First Tech<br />16 Heidelberg<br />17 Hitachi<br />18 Jandel<br />19 JEOL<br />20 Karl Suss<br />21 Kulicke and Soffa<br />22 Modular Process Technology<br />23 Nanometrics<br />24 Nanonex<br />25 Nikon<br />26 Oxford<br />27 Plasmatherm<br />28 Reynolds Tech<br />29 Semitool<br />30 Specialty Coating Systems<br />31 Tepla<br />32 Toho<br />33 Tousimas<br />34 Tystar<br />35 Veeco<br />36 Vistec<br />37 VWR<br />38 Woollam<br />39 Xactix<br />40 Yield Engineering Systems<br />41 Zeiss</p>
<p>NIST is conducting market research to determine the best contracting solution through communications with industry that will allow for the procurement and start of maintenance (services and replacement parts) within hours of the identification of a NanoFab requirement.</p>
<p>INFORMATION REQUEST:</p>
<p>NIST is requesting input from industry on a recommended approach to fulfilling requirements for NanoFab equipment maintenance within hours of the identification of the requirement. Specifically, NIST is interested in crafting a procurement strategy that considers industry's constraints (i.e. related to company policy, warranties, manufacturing...) and is able to be executed in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations. Any party interested in assisting the Government as it investigates acquisition strategies is encouraged to attend the Information Day and/or prepare and submit a white paper with its constraints, observations, cautions, or recommendations. The white paper must be brief, should not exceed four pages in Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) format, should be written from the perspective of helping Government program managers make a decision regarding the procurement strategy, and should be email to megan.boblitt@nist.gov and mary.johnson@nist.gov by 12:00pm EST on May 4, 2012.</p>
<p>INFORMATION DAY: <br /><br />NIST will be holding an Information Day, which will include a tour of the NanoFab, to openly discuss the requirements, challenges, constraints, and approaches to fulfilling requirements on May 9, 2012 at 1:00pm to 5:00pm EST at the NIST Gaithersburg, MD location. Registration (which will close May 2, 2012) is required through the following website: https://www-s.nist.gov/CRS/conf_disclosure.cfm?conf_id=5342</p>
<p>Please be advised, for security reasons, attendees who have not pre-registered will not be admitted to the NIST campus, or to the Information Day. All guests and visitors to the NIST campus must have the following items available before entering the Visitor's Center: Photo I.D. (State issued driver's license, Federal ID or passport) and Vehicle Registration card.</p>

The Chief of Naval Aviation Training (CNATRA) requires simulator support for the following individual pilot training course: Advanced Multi-Engine MPTS Flight Training (CNATRAINST 1542.147D) (https://www.cnatra.navy.mil/pubs/folder2/1542.147D.pdf).
The purpose of the Advanced Multi-Engine MPTS Flight Training is to develop multi-engine flight skills while emphasizing instrument flying and crew coordination.  At the successful completion of this training, the flight student will be designated a naval aviator or USAF pilot qualified in multi-engine aircraft, and will have earned a standard instrument rating.
 

This training will require a contractor provided T-44C ProLine 21(PL) Flight Training Device (FTD) and contractor maintenance support of the device(s).   Currently, T-44 (Beechcraft King Air C-90) pilot training is provided by CNATRA on an in-house basis through various sources, including a combination of Government provided and contractor provided personnel and equipment.  The Government is in the process of formulating requirements, based on one of the optional solutions listed below, for conducting the simulator portion of training for T-44C ProLine 21 (C-90 ProLine 21) pilots.  The T-44C PL 21 simulator training will require the use of a contractor provided T-44C (Beechcraft King Air C-90 ProLine 21) FAA equivalent Level 7 flight training device(s) (FAA certification is not required) with a freeze and reset capability and a FAA Level C (or higher) equivalent visual system capable of projecting a minimum 200-degree horizontal by a 45-degree vertical field of view (preferably up to 220 x 60 degree FOV) and the capability to simulate VMC, IMC, day, and night conditions.
 The optional solutions in order of preference include:

1.)	  Government would provide an appropriate facility at NAS Corpus Christi, TX for the contractor to set up, operate and maintain the contractor provided T-44C FTD(s) (minimally one (1) device with an option to provide up to four (4) T-44C FTDs), using Government provided instructors and T-44 curriculum (CNATRAINST 1542.147D).  An alternative option would be for the contractor to use their own contractor provided instructors, in lieu of Government instructors, using a Government provided T-44 curriculum. 

2.)	  Contractor owned/operated training devices would be located at a contractor provided facility in the Corpus Christi, TX area using Government provided instructors and the Government provided T-44 curriculum (i.e.
 leasing of contractor provided and maintained devices).  An alternative option would be for the contractor to provide the T-44C FTDs in the Corpus Christi, TX area using the contractor provided facility and instructors, using a Government provided T-44 curriculum. 

3.)	  Contractor would provide the training device(s), support personnel, and facilities for Government leasing at the contractors current training facility.  The Government would provide qualified T-44C instructors and curriculum, using the contractor provided T-44C FTDs and facilities.  An alternative option in this category would be for the contractor to provide the T-44C FTDs, facilities and contract instructors using the Government provided T-44 curriculum.
  

Contractor will be required to minimally provide one or more T-44C PL 21 (C-90 ProLine 21) Flight Training Device(s), support personnel required to operate and maintain the devices, and (if providing Academic/Simulator instructors) any additional labor required for supervising and administering classroom and simulator training; along with data rights for any contractor specific materials for this contracted training.  The Government will provide (as required, depending on option); facilities to support one or more (up to four (4)) T-44C PL 21 (C-90 ProLine 21) FTDs, all required course curriculum/syllabi, Government simulator/academic instructors (as required), and any additional Government specific courseware/materials needed for the training of T-44C pilots.
  These T-44C PL 21training courses require both classroom academic and practical training using one or more T-44C PL 21 FTDs.  The FTDs will be required to simulate the performance and functional operation of the T-44C PL 21 aircraft and will be required to minimally meet FAA Level 7 FTD certification requirements as defined under current FAA Advisory Circular 120-45A (FAA certification is not required).  The contractor will use either contractor provided facilities and instructors or the Government-furnished facilities and instructors.  Under all optional solutions, the Government provided course syllabi will be used in conducting all classroom and simulator training.  All instructors must:  1) have a minimum of 1,000 flight hours; 2) have knowledge of Department of Defense (DOD) rules and regulations governing aircraft operations; and 3) be either a prior military pilot or possess an FAA flight instructor certificate with an instrument rating.
 

Businesses having the capabilities and facilities, including existing simulators, are invited to submit the following: 1) description of capabilities as they relate to the above requirements; 2) describe ability to provide the required T-44C PL 21 FTD(s) (minimum of one (1) with an option to provide up to four (4) FTDs); 3) specify the contractors  preference of providing training at a contractor or Government provided facility and describe contractors ability to relocate and install a qualified device to a Government facility, as applicable; 4) business size/status (NAICS code for this requirement is 611512, size standard - $25.5M); and, 5) listing of contracts performing similar services (past or present), including references.
  Responses will serve as a basis for the government's decision to fulfill this requirement under a set-aside, full and open competition, or sole source acquisition.  Responses or questions are requested to be sent via email to alan.wright@navy.mil, but can be faxed to 407-380-4742, or mailed to: Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division; ATTN: A. Wright - 25341; 12350 Research Pkwy.; Orlando, FL  32826-3275.  This announcement is for planning purposes only and should not be construed as a commitment by the government to procure the requirements described.  There is no solicitation available at this time.

<DESC>Junctional Tourniquets for the Department of Defense Research On Combat Casualty Care<br><br>The Combat Casualty Care Research Program of the Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) provides integrated capabilities for far-forward medical care to reduce mortality and morbidity associated with major battlefield wounds and injuries. The USAMRMC is seeking information regarding novel junctional tourniquets, both FDA approved and prototype devices, for hemorrhage control of junctional injuries on the battlefield (groin and axilla). Interested firms should submit a 1-3 page whitepaper (with additional sheets for diagrams as necessary) describing such devices and the concept of use. Information will be reviewed pursuant to consideration for the development of a request for devices to be tested. As such, any descriptions of clinical use or test and evaluation studies will be of use. For the purposes of this request for information, we anticipate that devices:<br><br>1) Will be able to occlude arterial bleeding from femoral, iliac, subclavian, axillary, and brachial arteries at compressible sites where standard tourniquets cannot be applied; 2) Can be applied easily in a tactical environment; 3) Must not slip during tightening or following application; 4) Be capable of easy release and re-application; 5) Be of light weight; 6) Have long shelf life, low cost and low cube.<br>

<DESC>Notice of Intent
<p>Reference: 2012-43029</p>
<p>Validation of Serologic Tools for Trachoma</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Center for Global (CGH) Division of Parasitic Diseases and Malaria (DPDM), Procurements and Grants Office, International Branch, intends to awards a Sole Source, firm fixed, priced contract in accordance with FAR 13 using simplified acquisition procedures. Services to be obtained are from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Keppel Street, London WC1E 7HT, UK. The London School of Hygiene will provide validation of serologic tools for trachoma surveillance. They will also provide a set of samples for a well-characterized patient population to the CDC for serology testing of antibody responses to previously characterized Chlamydia antigens. LTHTM has an established site and is unique in that individual community residents have been monitored for trachoma infection status for nearly 10 years and have been free of trachoma for the past eight years. Specimens from these persons represent a one-of-a-kind resource critical for validation new CDC serologic tools; other institutions have only community-level data and in places where trachoma transmission has not been interrupted.</p>
<p><br />Description of Services:</p>
<p>The contractor shall perform the following tasks: <br />1. Develop a survey protocol: In the first three months, a survey protocol will be developed for testing the value of population-level serology for post-elimination surveillance through the collection of serum samples and/or blood spots and clinical evidence of ocular CT infection in a setting such as Rombo district, Tanzania, where transmission of ocular CT infection ceased eight years ago and where patient populations have been well characterized.</p>
<p>2. Conduct field work: Up to six months will be spent on field data collection in the selected district. In each selected community, a serum sample and/or blood spot will be collected from each consenting individual. Individuals also will be examined for signs of clinical trachoma and have a conjunctival swab collected. All serum samples and/or blood spots will be provided to CDC.</p>
<p>3.

The anticipated IDIQ award is May 2012; prior to the award of the IDIQ, the FWS is establishing stand alone Purchase Orders to support current requirements. 
No further actions were taken to locate other sources for this requirement, as an IDIQ was anticipated to be in place by May 2012; however, the IDIQ award date has been postponed.   For more information contact Millie Cortes at 907-786-3409 or millie_cortes@fws.gov.

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

(End of clause)<BR><BR>The RAPIDGate Program enables electronic verification of identity and access privileges at Fort McCoy?s access control points (ACPs), thereby improving security and streamlining access to the installation.
Access Privilege Management
Companies choosing to participate in the RAPIDGate Program will have streamlined access onto the installation. Participants will have access through all gates that size permits (Main Gate, Gate 5, Gate 15 and Gate 20) and will only be subject to RANDOM vehicle inspections. At the Main Gate RAPIDGate participants will be able to utilize either lane, enabling fast access onto the installation through that gate. 
 Companies choosing not to participate in the RAPIDGate Program will be required to access the installation through the Main Gate, utilizing the commercial lane only. To enter the installation a pass is required for each person. Currently the maximum pass period is 30 days.  Effective December 1, 2010, maximum day pass will be reduced to 14 days and on April 1, 2011 only a one day pass will be issued.  To obtain a pass, you will be required to go to Vehicle Registration at the Welcome Center, show identification (i.e. driver?s license), vehicle registration, proof of insurance, contract award letter and/or bill of lading to obtain a pass to the installation. NO PASSES WILL BE ISSUED AT THE GATE. Vehicle Registration hours are Monday ? Friday 7:30a.m. ? 4:00p.m.  Significant delays may result from choosing to access the installation by obtaining a one day pass.  In which The Government will not be held responsible for any access delays.  Contractor may not at any time request consideration as a result of choosing to access the installation using the day pass process.  
Enrollment/Registration
Companies that service Fort McCoy may enroll in the RAPIDGate Program by calling 1-877-RAPIDGate (1-877-727-4342).  The Program will confirm with the installation that the company has legitimate business on the installation. Once the company has enrolled, its employees can register at the self-service Registration Station located at the Fort McCoy Welcome Center.
The RAPIDGate Program confirms the individual?s employment status with the company, and then performs identity authentication and background screening.  Employees who qualify are issued a personalized RAPIDGate ID Badge.  The Program performs background screening on a regular basis to verify continued eligibility in the Program.
Questions about the Fort McCoy RAPIDGate Program should be addressed to info@rapidgate.com with the subject line RE: RAPIDGate Program, or to the Physical Security Branch, Directorate of Emergency Services at 608-388-4694.<BR><BR>FAR 19.303(a) requires that the appropriate NAICS code and related small business size standard be included in all solicitations above the micropurchase threshold.

<p>Addenda to 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items</p>
<p>a) The government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>I) Technical Capabilities<br />a) Experience<br />b) Understanding of the Requirement<br />II) Price</p>
<p>Technical Capabilities and its sub factors, are significantly more important than price. However, as Offeror's ratings for the non-price factors approach equality, price becomes significantly more important in the award decision.</p>
<p>b) Options. The government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>The Government will award a single Firm Fixed Price contract from this combined synopsis/solicitation. To receive consideration for award, a rating of no less than "Acceptable" must be achieved for Factor I, (Technical Capabilities). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with Offerors. Therefore, the Offeror's initial offer should contain the Offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Purchasing Agent to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES - The proposals will be evaluated to determine whether the Offeror's methods and approach have adequately and completely considered, defined, and satisfied the requirements specified in the solicitation and whether the Offeror's methods and approach to meeting the solicitation requirements provide the Government with a high level of confidence of successful completion within the required schedule. No pricing information is to be provided in the Technical Capabilities. The Government will evaluate the Offeror's understanding of the work to be performed in accordance with the SOW. The Offeror shall submit a proposal that demonstrates its understanding of the work described in Part 5 of the SOW. The Government must receive enough information to make a determination that the Offeror can complete the defined work or the proposal may be considered non-responsive.</p>
<p>PRICE - The Offeror shall provide a document outlining their pricing using the attached Request for Quotations. Pricing must be provided separately from your technical capabilities.</p>
<p>FACTOR I - TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES - The Offeror shall submit a proposal that acknowledges the tasks identified in the Statement of Work to allow the Government to make a sufficient determination that the Offeror is capable of performing the work.<br />Sub factor a. EXPERIENCE - The Offeror shall provide a synopsis of their experience in performing the tasks listed in the Statement of Work.<br />Sub factor b. UNDERSTANDING OF THE REQUIREMENT - The Government will evaluate the Offeror's understanding of the work to be performed in accordance with the SOW. The Offeror shall submit a proposal acknowledging that they are capable of completing the tasks identified in the SOW, outlining their method and approach to completing the requirements.</p>
<p>FACTOR II - PRICE - The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total of Base Period plus all options to ensure that pricing is not unbalanced. Price will be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness using the techniques in FAR 15.404-1(b)(2). Price will become significantly more important as technical ratings approach equality. No Adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Price.</p>
<p>Adjectival Ratings: Proposals will be adjectivally rated against each of the evaluation factors set forth in this plan and in the solicitation. Adjectival ratings for Factor I, Technical Capabilities follow. No Adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Factor II - Price.</p>
<p>Adjectival Ratings. The following adjectival ratings will be used:</p>
<p>Factor I - Technical Capabilities - will be rated using the following Adjectival Scale:<br />Acceptable - A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with minimal detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows a minimal understanding of the problems with an overall moderate to high degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Unacceptable - A proposal that contains major error(s), omission(s) or deficiency(ies) that indicate a lack of understanding of the SOW that may result in not being capable of meeting all the requirements or involves a very high risk; and none of these conditions can be corrected without a major rewrite or revision of the proposal.</p>
<p>Non-Price Factors - The importance of the Non-Price Evaluation Factors is in the following descending order with the most important factor listed first:</p>
<p>Factor I - Technical Capabilities and its sub factors are significantly more important than Factor II, Price. However, as Offeror's ratings for the non-price factors approach equality, Factor II, Price becomes significantly more important in the award decision.</p>
<p><br />A firm fixed price contract is anticipated for this project. Contract is Base Period of twelve (12) months plus two (2) twelve (12) month Option Periods. Contract is anticipated to begin on June 1, 2012. In order to be considered for the award, proposals must be provided for Base Period and all Option Periods.</p>

<DESC>Statement of Work
<p>Tonopah Test Range Preliminary Investigation Activities<br />A. PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION<br />Introduction<br />This statement of work is for services to be provided by an Unexploded Ordinance (UXO) Subcontractor to support preliminary investigation (PI) activities conducted by Navarro-Intera (NI) at the Tonopah Test Range (TTR) in Nevada. The services include a visual surveillance of the PI work area including identification of potential unexploded ordnance / munitions and explosives of concern (UXO/MEC), determination of UXO/MEC type, and implementation of the necessary safety measures required to conduct remaining PI activities. All UXO/MEC or suspected UXO/MEC discovered during performance of the survey will be flagged and the location recorded via global positioning system (GPS). UXO/MEC or suspected UXO/MEC shall not be excavated, relocated, removed, disposed, treated or detonated during PI activities. <br />The TTR is located approximately 235 miles (mi) northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada. The preliminary investigation sites are 2-3 square miles each and consist of Corrective Action Unit (CAU) 411 (Double Tracks), CAU 412 (Clean Slate I), CAU 413 (Clean Slate II), and CAU 414 (Clean Slate III), as well as some smaller outlying support areas. The Double Tracks and Clean Slate sites were utilized by the U.S. Department of Energy to perform plutonium (Pu) dispersion tests in the early 1960s. Each of the sites is presently posted as "Contamination Area" due to Pu-contaminated surface and subsurface soils. The sites are located on or near former and active U.S. Air Force bombing ranges.</p>
<p>1.0 Scope</p>
<p>The purpose of this statement of work is to perform visual and magnetometer surveys for suspect UXO/MEC under the direction of NI at the Tonopah Test Range in Nevada. <br />UXO personnel shall visually inspect each work area for surface UXO/MEC items in conjunction with performance of radiological surveys by NI Radiological Control Technicians (RCTs). UXO/MEC and suspect UXO/MEC items present within the survey area will be evaluated, identified, and flagged by UXO Technicians. UXO personnel shall identify and tag waypoint coordinates of each located UXO/MEC item using NI-provided GPS units, UXO personnel shall record location, type/identification of UXO/MEC item, quantity, and any other important information in the Subcontractor daily log. It is anticipated that most UXO/MEC will be flagged and the location recorded for future removal/demilitarization (by others), however, if the UXO/MEC is determined to be an imminent hazard, the item's location shall be recorded, and UXO personnel shall evacuate all site personnel to a safe distance. NI anticipates that one UXO/MEC Senior UXO Supervisor (SUXOS) and one UXO/MEC Technician II are required to support PI activities. <br />The UXO Subcontractor will utilize subcontractor -provided hand held analog magnetometers capable of detecting UXO/ MEC to a minimum depth of 1.0 ft bgs to assist in location and identification of buried/partially buried UXO/MEC. Preliminary investigation activities may include collection of soil samples by NI personnel. The UXO Subcontractor will ensure all sampling locations (surface and subsurface) areas are clear of MEC prior to allowing NI personnel to collect soil. <br /><br />UXO personnel shall investigate an existing known MEC item (previously identified as an Honest John rocket) located at the Clean Slate III site. UXO personnel shall develop a written recommendation/plan for future removal/demo in place of this MEC item.</p>
<p>The work will be performed under the direct supervision of NI personnel. The NI Site Supervisor will have responsibility and authority for daily operations, work authorization through Plan of the Day (POD) meetings, and will direct the operations of the UXO Subcontractor. All site activities on the TTR will be coordinated through the NI Site Supervisor with assistance of the Subcontractor Senior UXO Supervisor.</p>
<p>2.0 Safety<br />The scope of work includes access to areas known or suspected to contain UXO/MEC. The UXO Subcontractor must comply with DOE Manual 440.1-1A, DOE Explosives Safety Manual, along with NI established hazard analyses, work planning and control processes. <br /><br />The UXO Subcontractor will work within the established NI safety envelope based on the requirements contained in the NI Worker Safety and Health Program (10 CFR 851) and Integrated Safety Management System (ISMS) Program. The UXO Subcontractor will be required to work under the approved TTR Preliminary Investigations Site-Specific Health and Safety Plan (SSHASP). The NI SSHASP will describe general work hazards and controls including potential occupational safety and health hazards associated with UXO/MEC surface clearance and planned preliminary investigation activities.</p>
<p>3.0 Minimum Training and Qualifications</p>
<p>Prior to arrival onsite, the UXO Subcontractor shall be responsible for certifying that their employees meet the requirements of pre-assignment training, consistent with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.120 paragraph (e). Documentation certifying that each site worker has received 40 hours of HAZWOPER instruction, including current 8 hour refresher will be provided to NI. Field personnel will be required to comply with the medical, requirements specified in 29 CFR 1910.120(f). UXO field personnel may also be required to wear full face respiratory protection, and shall provide evidence of fitness for respirator use per 29 CFR 1910.134.</p>
<p>Entry into posted radiologically controlled Contamination Areas, and High Contamination Areas is anticipated. UXO personnel will be required to obtain a Radiological Worker II qualification (training provided by NI), and wear respiratory protection (full face respirator).</p>
<p>Approximately 40 hours of field On-The-Job-Training (OJT) will be provided to UXO field staff prior to mobilization to the TTR. Personnel will be mobilized to the National Nuclear Security Site (NNSS) or other location to be determined, for observation and practice of work skills (e.g., Radiation Worker II, site access, etc), prior to mobilization to the TTR.</p>
<p>4.0 Deliverables<br />The UXO Subcontractor shall provide a copy of their Corporate Health and Safety Program, and Quality Assurance/Quality Control Program Plan, including Training and Qualification Plans with proposal. <br />The UXO Subcontractor shall, on a daily basis, provide the NI Site Supervisor with the following:<br />&bull; A summary (log of activities) of that day's activities and results (e.g., UXO/ MEC identified including type and quantity, and GPS coordinates of UXO/MEC). <br />&bull; An electronic data file containing GPS coordinates for UXO/MEC and other items or features of concern identified during that day's activities.<br />Prior to project closeout, UXO subcontractor shall provide a written plan for removal/demilitarization of the existing Honest John rocket located at the Clean Slate III site. The plan shall include the Subcontractor recommendations and procedures for removal and demilitarization or demolition in place of the Honest John rocket, including personnel and equipment requirements, estimates for donor explosives, and costs. <br />5.0 Equipment</p>
<p>The UXO Subcontractor shall provide the necessary equipment, supplies, and material to safely execute the described activities with the exception of project vehicles, GPS units, and on-site communication devices.

<p>The Export-Import Bank of the United States (Ex-Im Bank) intends to make an award for rating information with Fitch's Global Sovereign, Global Banks, and Global Corporates subscription services.

The applicable NAICS code is 511199-All Other Publishers, with a small business size standard of 500 employees.

Fitch's reports are used in conjunction with other rating agency reports. Other sources of ratings reports used by Ex-Im Bank include Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's. Fitch provides not only complementary content, but also unique coverage and analysis unavailable anywhere else. Fitch is often the only source for certain bank and sovereign ratings materials.</p>

<p>&bull; Provide access to ratings and ratings reports for Global Banks, Sovereigns, &amp; Corporates<br />&bull; Provide the above types of research for banks and sovereigns that are not covered by other rating agencies<br />&bull; Provide credit ratings and opinions for banks and sovereigns that is unique and different from other rating agencies<br />&bull; Past performance.</p>
<p>Technical and past performance, when combined are significantly more important than price.</p>

<DESC><p>&nbsp;OMBUDSMAN-NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTEST
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contract the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

<p>The Request for Quotation number is HSCG79-12-Q-PCR085 and incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-57. This acquisition is unrestricted for offers' business size 1500 employees. The NAICS is 481212. The contract type will be a firm fixed price contract. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items, prepared in accordance with the format at FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation to be issued. Proposals are being requested as a written solicitation will not be issued. Purchase order to be awarded shall be under the authority of FAR part 12 "Acquisitions of Commercial Items". The Government proposes to solicit offers for the following services and quantities:</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE: The NDS Radio sites to be fueled are remote sites that are only accessible by helicopter. There is no road access to any of these sites and the weather conditions can vary considerably in any season. Fuel type is propane unless otherwise noted. Typical transportation of fuel to these sites will include the use of a barge and/or helicopter. Full 125 gallon "pickle barrels" are transported by barge to a location near the site and then slung to the remote site by a helicopter rated for that load. A fuel mechanic removes the barrels from the sling and transfers the propane from the pickle barrels to standard 500 gallon propane tanks. This process is repeated until all tanks are at maximum capacity. Offeror must have experience with this type of task due to high risks associated with it.</p>
<p>FUEL REQUIREMENT: Fuel Requirement: Contractor shall fuel remote site with propane quantities and delivery date per Attachment 1 requirement. All tanks are to be filled to maximum capacity. Government estimate for fuel amounts should be +/- 10 % for each site, due to the accuracy of the gauges. Contractor shall be prepared to account for this variation by carrying up to 10 % more fuel than fixed requirement calls for to handle this contingency. Contractor shall perform propane leak checks (soap spray or sniffer) on all propane tanks and fuel lines at NDS remote sites, up to the location where fuel line enters generator hut. Leaks found during these inspections shall be isolated and repaired. In the event of an irreparable leak requiring additional cost to repair, notify the Contracting Officer immediately for action to be taken. The Contractor shall record actual gallons of propane delivered to each site on the invoice and tank gauge level percentages before and after filling. All documentation will be delivered to Contracting Officer within one week of work completion.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred which reasonably could have been avoided. <br />(m) Termination for cause. The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon request, with adequate assurances of future performance.

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.</p>

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Past performance<br />The technical evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award. <br />Ratings: All technical factors will be rated using an adjectival approach uitilizing the following adjectival ratings: Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Marginal or Unsatisfactory. An Unsatisfactory proposal will not be considered for award. <br />2. PRICE <br />(a) Award, if made, will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best value to the Government, technical, performance risk, price and other factors considered. In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting</p>
<p>contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

<p><br /><strong>Proposal Submission Place:<br /></strong>Mr. Aniruddha Basu<br />Vice President<br />CESC Limited<br />CESC House, Chowringhee Square<br />Kolkata- 700 001<br />India<br />Phone: +91 33 2225 6040<br />Fax: +91 33 2236 5433<br />Email: <a href="mailto:aniruddha.basu@rp-sg.inhttp://www.cescltd.com/">aniruddha.basu@rp-sg.in<br />http://www.cescltd.com/</a></p>
<p>The CESC Limited (CESC) (the "Grantee") invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to complete a feasibility study that will develop requirements and specifications for a smart grid implementation roadmap for CESC as well as a smart grid pilot that will be designed as part of the study. The project is will provide for greater system integration with distributed generators as well as to help provide application models for other distribution networks in India.</p>
<p>India's ongoing economic expansion continues to face risks related to inadequate and irregular supply of electric power. India's energy demand is predicted to more than double by 2030, requiring significant investment in generation, transmission and distribution capacity, and potentially increasing the frequency of power outages even in urban areas. Indian utilities face unprecedented challenges from a growing demand for high-quality, reliable electricity, increasingly stringent regulation, environmental concerns, and rising customer expectations, which require utilities to transform traditional electricity generation, transmission and delivery systems. Smart grid technologies are seen to provide a solution to this set of challenges, providing the ability to improve the quality and reliability of service, reduce technical and commercial power losses, integrate consumer use with peak and off-peak demand periods, and take advantage of distributed generation potential.</p>
<p>The private sector utility CESC shares these challenges with other Indian power utility companies, and currently suffers from transmission and distribution losses of approximately 13 percent. Transmission and distribution losses range up to 40 percent for public sector utilities in India. Nevertheless, CESC hopes to achieve transmission and distribution loss levels of 6 percent or less, which is more in line with international utility standards. The feasibility study will provide a roadmap for the development of a comprehensive implementation plan for a smart grid rollout in its distribution system. The study includes a design of smart grid pilot activities as part of the study and would assess the technological, economic, regulatory and financial viability of implementing smart grid projects in the CESC network. It will also focus on a review and analysis of the requirements and recommend a pilot project and system-wide upgrades including distribution system automation, telecommunications upgrades, IT system plans, integrating smart meters, home area networks and other relevant smart grid interactive communication technologies and management systems into the CESC distribution and management system. CESC has already initiated certain small trials with Ring Monitoring Units (RMU) and several hundred automated meter reading (AMR) applications. CESC anticipates that the smart grid project and technology solutions would immediately help it in its ongoing quest to improve the quality and reliability of service while reducing technical and commercial power losses.</p>
<p>The objective of this FS is to provide recommendations for improving the efficiency and reliability of CESC's 2.5 million customer distribution system in Kolkata, India. The project will address a range of needed improvements and investments including the integration of smart meters and automated meter reading into CESC's distribution system. In addition, the study will develop requirements and specifications for a Smart Grid implementation roadmap as well as the design of a Smart Grid pilot project. This initiative is expected to provide for greater system integration with other power generators in India as well as to help provide application models for other electricity distribution networks throughout the country.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a US$618,860 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA). A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits. However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 12 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>The OTI program in Kyrgyzstan will support the objectives of the U.S. Embassy, the USAID Country Office in Kyrgyzstan (USAID/ Kyrgyzstan), and the USAID Regional Mission to the Central Asian Republics (USAID/CAR) of (1) economic growth, (2) investing in people through health care and education, and (3) governing democratically and justly by strengthening parliament and local governance as well as civil society and media. The goals of the OTI program in Kyrgyzstan are to promote stability, decrease the chances of unrest, and facilitate efforts to restore core government functions.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>To aid in the evaluation process, proposals shall be clearly and concisely written as well as neat, indexed and cross indexed, and logically assembled. Format requirements and page limitations are established to facilitate ease of evaluation and to assist in determining whether Offerors are able to concisely communicate a clear understanding of the requirement and their proposed approach and capabilities. Prospective Offerors are asked to bear in mind that all material submitted should be directly pertinent to the requirements of this solicitation and that extraneous promotional material or brochures shall not be submitted, nor will be evaluated. All pages of each volume shall be appropriately numbered (i.e., "Page 1 of 10," etc.), and identified with the name of the Offeror, the date, and the solicitation number.</p>
<p>Offerors shall furnish the proposal in two separate volumes as follows:</p>
<p>VOLUME 1 - TECHNICAL:</p>
<p>The Offeror's technical submission should demonstrate the firm's capability to perform the requirements outlined in the RFP. Offerors shall provide a technical proposal that addresses the following four (4) evaluation factors:</p>
<p>(1) Experience - The contractor must have;</p>
<p>&bull; at least 8 years of experience working in research and public policy with law enforcement communities;<br />&bull; direct and lead experience in researching and designing a case study and lessons learned report of a multi-jurisdictional, law enforcement investigation/incident;<br />&bull; demonstrated experience conducting studies and assessments of highly sensitive and confrontational law enforcement situations;<br />&bull; demonstrated experience in producing documents that have been used by law enforcement administrators to modify agency practices.<br />&bull; demonstrated experience facilitating meetings with law enforcement personnel and government, executive level (Senior Executive Service) personnel.<br />&bull; demonstrated experience conducting course design workshops with subject matter experts, resulting in the design of a course lesson plan consisting of case studies and interactive exercises.</p>
<p>(2) Past Performance - Past performance may cite federal, state, local government, commercial sources, or not for profit sources, and should highlight the company's key role in the past performance being documented. This information shall consist of a one (1) page introductory matrix listing the offerors' and its critical subcontractors' past performance references. The offeror shall provide a minimum of three (3) references. In addition, the offeror may submit a minimum of three (3) references for subcontractors who are expected to perform aspects of this effort that the offeror considers critical to overall successful performance. The offeror should include rationale supporting the assertion of relevance for each reference. These references should also be from different contracts. To be considered, past performance data may not be older than three (3) years (normally 3, but could vary based on the industry) from the date of the proposal, and may include active contracts; if over one year old. Further, offerors should include a list of all relevant ATF on-going contracts or contracts completed for the specified period.</p>
<p>Past performance references shall be as a prime contractor or first-tier subcontractor on previous or current projects/tasks that are similar in size, scope, and complexity to the work identified in the SOW. Past performance does not necessarily have to be Government-related; but it is important to demonstrate and provide evidence of past performance for work similar in size, scope and complexity to that described in the RFP. The offeror is required to clearly demonstrate management actions implemented to overcome problems and the effects of those actions, in terms of improvements achieved or problems solved.</p>
<p>Offerors shall forward the attached Past Performance Questionnaire (Attachment D), to offeror's references. The references shall forward their completed questionnaires to the Contracting Officer, NOT BACK TO THE OFFEROR. The questionnaires shall be delivered via email directly from the offeror's references to Frankie.Murphy@atf.gov or faxed to (202)648-9654.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to use publicly available reports and data from the Contractor Performance System (CPS), Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) found on the web at http://www.PPIRS. The Government may also use present and/or past performance data obtained from a variety of sources, not just those contracts identified by offerors. For each reference, provide:</p>
<p>a. Reference Name (Company or Entity)<br />b. Program Title<br />c. Contracting Agency/Private Company<br />d. Contract Number/Task Order Number (if applicable)<br />e. Brief description of the contract effort, including results and successes<br />f. Type of Contract<br />g. Period of Performance<br />h. Original contract dollar value and current or actual dollar value<br />i. Actual completion date<br />j. Contact names, addresses, telephone numbers, Fax numbers and e-mail addresses of current, or last (if contract completed) Program Director/Manager and/or Contract Manager.</p>
<p>(3) Technical/Management Approach - The Offeror must define a technical and management approach that demonstrates a clear understanding of the SOW and its requirements. The Offeror's technical/management approach should include the following: 1) discussion of the background, objectives, and work requirements of the SOW; 2) discussion of proposed methods and techniques for completing and managing each task in a timely manner; 3) discussion which supports how each task will be managed by the Offeror's perspective; 4) discussion of any anticipated major difficulties and problem areas, along with potential recommended approaches for their resolution; 5) discussion of major logistical considerations and; 6) The Offeror's labor mix required to conduct the tasks and produce any deliverables must be identified.</p>
<p>(4) Key Personnel (Project Manager, Researcher, Curriculum Developer &amp; Facilitator) - The Offeror must ensure the proposed personnel skill levels, area of expertise, education, capability, availability and experience are adequate to perform the work required by the SOW. Therefore, a resume is required.</p>
<p>- Resume shall be submitted with quotation for proposed Project Manager. Resume shall include a description of the experience and capability of proposed personnel. Descriptions shall address such items as the individual's background, education, work experience and accomplishments; showing the knowledge that the individual has gained through completed and ongoing efforts that are similar in nature to this effort. Resume should not be longer than two (2) pages.</p>
<p>Page Limitation: The technical proposal submission shall be limited to eight (8) one-sided pages, excluding the resume(s), past performance reference information and any cover letter/title pages. OFFERORS ARE CAUTIONED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL ONLY EVALUATE THE FIRST EIGHT (8) PAGES OF ANY TECHNICAL PROPOSAL THAT EXCEEDS THE PAGE LIMITATION. Please do not attach any additional information as an Appendix.</p>
<p>Proposal shall be prepared in Times New Roman font, 12-point font, single line spacing, 1-inch margins, and 8-1/2 x 11 inch paper. Tables, figures and graphs may use Arial, 10 point font, single-spaced.</p>
<p>In order for the technical proposal to be evaluated strictly on the merit of the material submitted, NO COST/PRICE INFORMATION IS TO BE INCLUDED IN VOLUME I. The evaluation and award procedures in FAR 15.305 will be applied to this acquisition. The information submitted as Volume I will be evaluated on the information presented; therefore, organization, clarity, accuracy of information, relevance, and completeness are of prime importance.</p>
<p>VOLUME II - COST/PRICE (non rated)</p>
<p>Volume II shall consist of complete breakdown of proposed price; with files formatted in Microsoft Office. In addition to completing and returning the attached price schedule, the offeror must also provide a complete price breakdown of the quotation, which explains the development of the proposed costs (including labor categories, number of hours, corresponding fully loaded labor rates and any other direct costs). The proposed labor skill mix associated with the proposed labor rates will be analyzed to determine if the prices proposed are reasonable, for the type of work proposed. There is no page limit on price volume.</p>
<p>Pricing spreadsheets that are submitted in a very small font size and are not reasonably legible may be considered as unacceptable and grounds for exclusion from further consideration.<br />(ix) 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a Firm Fixed Price/Cost Reimbursable (travel) contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors (listed in descending order or relative importance) shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>(1) Experience - The degree to which to Offeror's experience demonstrates a thorough<br />working knowledge of successfully providing the required course design, development, <br />instruction and assessment.<br /><br />(2) Past Performance - The offerors' proposal will be evaluated to determine the extent to which<br />their performance demonstrates the likelihood of successful performance in providing requirements <br />similar in size, scope and complexity of this solicitation. The Government may choose to evaluate<br />publicly available reports, and/or data from the PPIRS. The Government may use present and/or past <br />performance data obtained from a variety of sources, not just those contracts identified by offeror. The <br />information gathered for past performance may also be used in the responsibility determination.</p>
<p><br />(3) Technical/Management Approach - The degree to which the Offeror effectively demonstrates a <br />knowledge, understanding, technical ability to successfully perform and manage the requirements of the SOW in an efficient and timely manner; as the proposed period of performance contained in the offeror's proposal will be evaluated for realism and achievability. Additionally, the appropriateness, soundness and reasonableness of the Offeror's problem resolution, logistic considerations, corporate commitment to achieve the overall project objectives and methodology for providing resource support will be assessed.</p>
<p>(4) Key Personnel - The degree to which the Offeror's proposed key personnel's (Project Manager,<br />Researcher, Curriculum Developer and Facilitator) resume demonstrates the individual's ability to<br />execute SOW requirements on the basis of strength of relevant education and training, depth and <br />breadth of relevant experience.</p>
<p>(5) Price - (non-rated) - Price will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(b), Price analysis <br />commercial and non-commercial items.</p>
<p>Factors 1-4 are referred to as technical factors. Factors 1-4 are in descending order of relative importance (Factor 1 is more important than 2, Factor 2 is more important than 3 and Factor 3 is more important than 4). Factors 1-4 (when combined) are significantly more important than Factor 4, Price, which is not rated.</p>
<p>As the technical proposals approach equality, price will become more important in making the award determination. In the event that two or more proposals are determined not to have any substantial technical differences (i.e. are technically equivalent), the Government will make an assessment through a trade-off analysis and other analytic means that involve the evaluation of superior technical capability versus the added cost. Based on Best Value, award may be made to the lower priced quotation. It should be noted that award may be made to other than the lowest priced quotation if the Government determines that a price premium is warranted due to technical merit. The Government may also award to other than the highest technically rated quotation, if the Government determines that a price premium is not warranted.</p>
<p>Award may also be made on the basis of initial quotations without discussions (although the right to conduct discussions, if necessary, is reserved). Offerors are therefore cautioned that each initial quotation should contain the Offeror's best terms.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). NOT APPLICABLE TO THIS REQUIREMENT</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>(x) 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (Mar 2012). Offerors shall provide representations and certifications (FAR 52.212-3) electronically via the BPN website (www.bpn.gov/orca). A copy of the on-line representations and certifications submission shall be included in the offeror's response.</p>
<p>(xi) 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items (Mar 2012), applies to this acquisition.</p>
<p>(xii) 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items (Mar 2012), applies to this acquisition. In addition, the following clauses are also incorporated by reference to implement provisions of law or executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items:</p>

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(2) Examples. <br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect; 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect; 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect; 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(ii) The Offeror has o has not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. <br />(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). <br />This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. <br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. <br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. <br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. (End of provision)</p>
<p>52.217-8, Option to Extend Services (Nov 1999): The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within the current period of performance. (End of clause)</p>

<DESC>**This notice is now classified as a Solicitation as of 13 Apr 12**<br /><br /><br />Solicitation Notice: FA8601-12-R-0011 <br />The Sources Sought notice is published under Project 090001 posted on 20 December 2012.
<p>This notice is posted in accordance with FAR 5.2 and 36.213-2.</p>
<p>This RESTRICTED ACQUISITION is set aside - 100% for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business. In order to qualify for this program, an offeror must be a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business concern for the below-cited NAICS code.</p>
<p>The NAICS code is 238220 and the Size Standard is $14M.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 4.1102 and DFARS 252.204-7004 "Required Central Contractor Registration," Contractor must be registered in CCR prior to award. Registration may be accomplished at http://www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>SOLICITATION NUMBER: FA8601-12-R-0011<br />This effort is Project 090001, Repair/Replace Steam Lines Area B. The project scope includes the removal of underground steam and condensate return lines, and the installation of new steam lines in shallow trench from manhole S-229 to facilities 20028, 20248, 20198, 20197, 20196, and 20029. The contractor will need to hook up two Government furnished temporary boilers to provide summer steam to Facilities 20030 and 20033 during project construction. Existing steam &amp; condensate return lines are assumed to contain asbestos containing insulating materials.</p>
<p>Special Requirements/Concerns: Steam distribution systems require specialized construction skills and safety preparations. Standard facility construction experience is not sufficient. The contractor shall have very tight construction timelines since these repairs cannot be started until after the high temperature/hot water (HTHW) system is turned off, and this must be completed in time for activation in the fall for this critical utility system. Numerous facilities will not have heat until this project is completed. The work will need to be carefully coordinated with the mechanical shop to minimize impact to mission. This project also includes HVAC and asbestos work.</p>
<p>The Air Force intends to award a contract with a 300 day period of performance.</p>
<p>The estimated magnitude of the entire contract is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.</p>

<DESC><strong>*****<br />Please Note that the proposal due date is May 16th 2012.&nbsp; See solicitation for details.<br /><br />******<br /></strong><br />The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has a requirement for <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Ambulance Patient Compartment Testing.<br /></strong></span><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I. Background</strong></span>
<p>The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), in partnership with the National Truck Equipment Association's Ambulance Manufacturers Division (AMD), is engaged in an effort to improve worker safety in the patient compartment of U.S. based ambulances. This collaborative work builds on completed research performed by NIOSH under past NIOSH funded projects. The first outcome from this joint effort was the development of AMD Standard 025, "Measuring Guidelines: Occupant Head Clearance Zones". Additional interim outcomes include the publishing of SAE J2917 "Surface Vehicle Recommended Practice for Occupant Restraint and Equipment Mounting Integrity - Frontal Impact System-Level Ambulance Patient Compartment (2010)" and SAE J2956 "Surface Vehicle Recommended Practice for Occupant Restraint and Equipment Mounting Integrity - Side Impact System-Level Ambulance Patient Compartment (2011)". These two SAE Recommended Practices document the response measured in an ambulance patient compartment during front and side full vehicle crash testing, respectively. SAE J2917 and J2956 are now being used as input loading for continuing work targeting improvements in seating, cot, and equipment mount design. It should be noted that while crash testing a vehicle in a 30 mph frontal impact, as was done during the development of the SAE J2917, is a standard requirement for all passenger vehicles weighing less than 8,500 lbs. (in accordance with Federal Vehicle Motor Vehicle Safety Standards), virtually all U.S. ambulances operate above this weight and are, therefore, largely exempt from this requirement.</p>
<p>With work on seating, cots, and equipment mounts underway, NIOSH and the AMD are now prepared to expand their work to include improvements to the structural integrity of the patient compartment. In an effort to move forward, the AMD established a sub-committee charged with developing a series of tests designed to better understand the loading applied to the patient compartment structure during a frontal impact (front corner of the patient compartment box) and a rollover event. The hope is to then translate these measured "dynamic" loading events into a repeatable static test for the industry's use.</p>
<p>Under this contracting effort, the Contractor shall utilize the testing methodologies proposed by the AMD Body Integrity Subcommittee (attached), to conduct dynamic and static testing of the patient compartments of several ambulances. Testing shall be conducted to accomplish several tasks: (1) validate the testing methods proposed in each dynamic test, (2) to acquire the loading experienced by the patient compartment structure during each dynamic test, and (3) to validate the methods proposed in the static test to fully exercise the patient compartment's structural integrity.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>II. Project Objectives Related to this Contract</strong></span></p>
<p>This contract shall quantify the dynamic loading experienced by the patient compartment of a commercial ambulance through the use of four different testing methods. These test methods are draft documents proposed by an industry-government team of experts and borrow heavily from testing of civilian and commercial vehicles. As a part of this process, the testing methods themselves shall be evaluated and validated. At the completion of this testing program the Contractor will have created a dataset which will:</p>
<p>1. Qualify the logic and language described in each of the four proposed test methods.</p>
<p>2. Provide the data necessary for AMD and its partners to approve one to four of the proposed test methods as a new standard or standards to validate improvements in the structural integrity of patient compartment of the ambulance.</p>
<p>3. If funded as options to the effort, the pulse shapes described in SAE J2917 and SAE J2956 will be validated for use in the design of interiors for Type II (raised roof vans and Sprinters).</p>
<p>The Contractor will be expected to work to a fairly aggressive schedule as this data will be evaluated for possible inclusion in the second edition of the new National Fire Protection Association's NFPA 1917 Automotive Ambulance Standard. This is the first national consensus standard which has gained the support of most factions associated with the industry: manufacturers, end users, suppliers, and government purchasers. The first edition is expected to be published in June 2012. A comment period of 12 months will follow leading to the development of the 2nd edition. Given the goal of this research is to influence the 2nd Edition; we anticipate a need to be finished prior to June 2013.</p>
<p><strong>This requirement is being solicited on an unrestricted basis as full and open competition. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The CDC expects a single firm fixed price with a period of performance of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nine (9) months.</span></strong></p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) is seeking potential sources to support the Chief of Naval Aviation Trainings (CNATRA) T-44C (Navy configured Raytheon/Beechcraft King Air C-90 ProLine 21) pilot training program. 

The Chief of Naval Aviation Training (CNATRA) requires simulator support for the following individual pilot training course: Advanced Multi-Engine MPTS Flight Training (CNATRAINST 1542.147D) (https://www.cnatra.navy.mil/pubs/folder2/1542.147D.pdf).
The purpose of the Advanced Multi-Engine MPTS Flight Training is to develop multi-engine flight skills while emphasizing instrument flying and crew coordination.  At the successful completion of this training, the flight student will be designated a naval aviator or USAF pilot qualified in multi-engine aircraft, and will have earned a standard instrument rating.
 

This training will require a contractor provided T-44C ProLine 21(PL) Flight Training Device (FTD) and contractor maintenance support of the device(s).   Currently, T-44 (Beechcraft King Air C-90) pilot training is provided by CNATRA on an in-house basis through various sources, including a combination of Government provided and contractor provided personnel and equipment.  The Government is in the process of formulating requirements, based on one of the optional solutions listed below, for conducting the simulator portion of training for T-44C ProLine 21 (C-90 ProLine 21) pilots.  The T-44C PL 21 simulator training will require the use of a contractor provided T-44C (Beechcraft King Air C-90 ProLine 21) FAA equivalent Level 7 flight training device(s) (FAA certification is not required) with a freeze and reset capability and a FAA Level C (or higher) equivalent visual system capable of projecting a minimum 200-degree horizontal by a 45-degree vertical field of view (preferably up to 220 x 60 degree FOV) and the capability to simulate VMC, IMC, day, and night conditions.
 The optional solutions in order of preference include:

1.)	  Government would provide an appropriate facility at NAS Corpus Christi, TX for the contractor to set up, operate and maintain the contractor provided T-44C FTD(s) (minimally one (1) device with an option to provide up to four (4) T-44C FTDs), using Government provided instructors and T-44 curriculum (CNATRAINST 1542.147D).  An alternative option would be for the contractor to use their own contractor provided instructors, in lieu of Government instructors, using a Government provided T-44 curriculum. 

2.)	  Contractor owned/operated training devices would be located at a contractor provided facility in the Corpus Christi, TX area using Government provided instructors and the Government provided T-44 curriculum (i.e.
 leasing of contractor provided and maintained devices).  An alternative option would be for the contractor to provide the T-44C FTDs in the Corpus Christi, TX area using the contractor provided facility and instructors, using a Government provided T-44 curriculum. 

3.)	  Contractor would provide the training device(s), support personnel, and facilities for Government leasing at the contractors current training facility.  The Government would provide qualified T-44C instructors and curriculum, using the contractor provided T-44C FTDs and facilities.  An alternative option in this category would be for the contractor to provide the T-44C FTDs, facilities and contract instructors using the Government provided T-44 curriculum.
  

Contractor will be required to minimally provide one or more T-44C PL 21 (C-90 ProLine 21) Flight Training Device(s), support personnel required to operate and maintain the devices, and (if providing Academic/Simulator instructors) any additional labor required for supervising and administering classroom and simulator training; along with data rights for any contractor specific materials for this contracted training.  The Government will provide (as required, depending on option); facilities to support one or more (up to four (4)) T-44C PL 21 (C-90 ProLine 21) FTDs, all required course curriculum/syllabi, Government simulator/academic instructors (as required), and any additional Government specific courseware/materials needed for the training of T-44C pilots.
  These T-44C PL 21training courses require both classroom academic and practical training using one or more T-44C PL 21 FTDs.  The FTDs will be required to simulate the performance and functional operation of the T-44C PL 21 aircraft and will be required to minimally meet FAA Level 7 FTD certification requirements as defined under current FAA Advisory Circular 120-45A (FAA certification is not required).  The contractor will use either contractor provided facilities and instructors or the Government-furnished facilities and instructors.  Under all optional solutions, the Government provided course syllabi will be used in conducting all classroom and simulator training.  All instructors must:  1) have a minimum of 1,000 flight hours; 2) have knowledge of Department of Defense (DOD) rules and regulations governing aircraft operations; and 3) be either a prior military pilot or possess an FAA flight instructor certificate with an instrument rating.
 

Businesses having the capabilities and facilities, including existing simulators, are invited to submit the following: 1) description of capabilities as they relate to the above requirements; 2) describe ability to provide the required T-44C PL 21 FTD(s) (minimum of one (1) with an option to provide up to four (4) FTDs); 3) specify the contractors  preference of providing training at a contractor or Government provided facility and describe contractors ability to relocate and install a qualified device to a Government facility, as applicable; 4) business size/status (NAICS code for this requirement is 611512, size standard - $25.5M); and, 5) listing of contracts performing similar services (past or present), including references.
  Responses will serve as a basis for the government's decision to fulfill this requirement under a set-aside, full and open competition, or sole source acquisition.  Responses or questions are requested to be sent via email to alan.wright@navy.mil, but can be faxed to 407-380-4742, or mailed to: Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division; ATTN: A. Wright - 25341; 12350 Research Pkwy.; Orlando, FL  32826-3275.  This announcement is for planning purposes only and should not be construed as a commitment by the government to procure the requirements described.  There is no solicitation available at this time.

<DESC>				Questions and Answers

1.	The initial RFP, dated November 22, 2005 was a Cascade Set Aside, small business and HUB zone. The current one is unrestricted. Is there a reason for the change?

Market Research deemed this requirement as such


2.	Your current program is both piece priced and pound priced, as well as Rental linen and Customer Owned Goods. The RFP I am reviewing is all pound priced. The reason for the piece pricing and pound pricing in your current service is as follows:

a. Piece pricing: OR items, wrappers and towels must be individually inspected over a light table to make sure they meet OR standards. OR items are supplied by the Contractor. They are piece priced due to the required inspection. Can these remain piece priced?

b. Customer Owned Goods: Pajama tops and bottoms are purchased and owned by the VA. We process them at a reduced piece price, fold and return them. Will these continue to be COG items and piece priced?

Please price based on per clean pound. Reason being, we are contemplating awarding an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract as the poundage will vary greatly throughout the contract. We are focused more technical subfactors/approach than pricing and/or separate CLINs. In addition, the initial RFP was listed with a price schedule per pound as such as this is


3.	On page 24, reference is made to a Pre-Award Survey. Does this take place after the RFP due date of April 20th?

After the RFP due date, if necessary


4.	On page 29, #3 Technical Subfactor C- Physical Facility, will photographs be allowed to show the compliance of the different areas of our plant?

Photographs of the plant are not required at the RFP closing. Per technical subfactor C (pg. 28), offerors shall provide a detailed description of their physical facility. If necessary, the Government will inspect the offeror's facility. If conducted, only the most highly rated proposals will undergo a facility inspection.

<p>11th Contracting Squadron, Wing/Joint Partner Support Flight (CONS/LGCB)<br />1500 West Perimeter Road, Suite 2780<br />Joint Base Andrews MD 20762</p>
<p>Contracting Officer: Rhonda Y. Coles</p>
<p>This is a limited sources/sole source justification. The Purchase Request (PR) Number is:</p>
<p>II. NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING PROCESSED<br /><br />11 CONS/LGCB intends to award a sole source, six month firm-fixed price contract with Maryland Department of Education, Division of Rehabilitation Services, Business Enterprise Program for the Blind, 2301 Argonne Drive, Baltimore, MD 21218. Son's Quality Food Company, a State Licensing Agency is performing the services under the Randolph Sheppard Act through the Department of Education under contract FA4416-08-C-0010. <br /><br />III. DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES/SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEEDS</p>
<p>The estimated value of this proposed action is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) funding. The proposed acquisition is to provide all personnel, supervision and any items and services necessary to perform full food services at Joint Base Andrews, MD for the period of 1 April 2012 - 30 September 2012. Services shall include the following:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Category</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Monthly</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">6 Month Extended Price<br /><br /></span>Freedom Hall - Full Food Service <br />Flight Kitchen - Full Food Service <br />Dry Ice (9000lbs @ <br />Extended Services Hours (100hrs @ <br />Reimbursable/Replacement Parts (NTE 6 months) <br />Grounds Maintenance (Fall &amp; Winter) (1 mos @ <br />Grounds Maintenance (Spring &amp; Summer) (5 mos @ <br />Total <br /><br />IV. STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>10 USC 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.</p>
<p>V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)</p>
<p>ONLY ONE RESPONSIBLE SOURCE (FAR 6.302-1) - The subject requirement is to perform Full Food Services at Freedom Hall and the In-Flight kitchen at Joint Base Andrews without interruption. As the incumbent, Maryland Department of Education is currently providing the required services under competitively awarded contract FA4416-08-C-0010 (Period of Performance: 01 October 2010 to 31 March 2012 to include the 6-month extension. A 6-month bridge is required to guarantee there is not a break in service for the subject work/contract. FAR clause 52.217-8 will be incorporated as a precautionary measure to ensure uninterrupted service to full food services while the follow-on competition is completed. Therefore, this acquisition will be a follow-on contract for the continued operation and performance of a high visibility and mission essential service.</p>
<p>As the incumbent, the Maryland Department of Education is currently performing food services on Joint Base Andrews. The company has the infrastructure and the corporate knowledge to meet the Government's schedule. They are able to provide the supplies and services for the extension described in Section II above without the U.S. Air Force experiencing unacceptable delays in fulfilling its requirements. On an average 1500-2000 personnel utilize the facility daily and not having a contract in place on 1 April 2012 will require the Air Force to pay per diem rates to all the personnel who utilize it, causing a significant financial impact to the Air Force. <br /><br />The 11th Wing believes that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be covered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Air force's requirements. Without any transition time with the incumbent contractor, the Government estimates that it would take 4 to 6 months for a new contractor to be fully functional and capable to perform at a standard able to maintain full food service operations. This estimate includes the assumption of a separate contract being awarded to hire functional experts from the incumbent contractor to lead the new contract team, vetting new personnel, getting new personnel badged, externally employing subject matter experts getting the new contractor smart on roles and responsibilities and finally gaining general proficiency to satisfactorily perform tasks at the required standard.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the Maryland Department of Education is the only firm capable of providing the supplies and services described in Section III above without the U.S. Air Force experiencing unacceptable delays in fulfilling its requirements.</p>
<p>VI. DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS DEEMED PRACTICABLE</p>
<p>11 CONS posted a pre-solicitation notice on FedBizOpps on 7 July 2011. Several potential offerors showed interest in providing a proposal. 11 CONS is currently working a follow-on contract to this effort, the award of which will be a competitive award.</p>
<p>VII. DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer will determine that the anticipated cost to the Government is fair and reasonable using price analysis. In its analysis, the Contracting Officer may compare proposal prices to historical prices paid for the same or similar items, and compare proposal prices to the Independent Government Cost Estimates. As well, the Contractor may analyze market data, commercial catalog pricing, and request information from other Air Force bases to identify the Government's pre-negotiation position.</p>
<p>VIII. DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND THE RESULTS, OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASONS MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED</p>
<p>The Government received multiple responses to its presolicitation notice. Due to time constraints, the Government intends to award a 6 month contract to Maryland Department of Education; however the Government plans on awarding the follow-on contract as a competitive award.</p>
<p>IX. ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
