<SUBJECT>B--White Papers Sought for Proposed Research on Hurricane Ivan Impact in the Offshore Gulf of Mexico
<SOLNBR>0105RP39065
<RESPDATE>012705
<ARCHDATE>12092005
<CONTACT>Michael W. Hargrove Contract Specialist 7037871367     Michael.Hargrove@mms.gov;
<DESC>This announcement solicits White Papers of not more than five (5) pages in length, for specific areas of interest to the Minerals Management Service (MMS) Technology Assessment and Research (TA&R) Program on Hurricane Ivan.  The initiative is entitled "White Papers Sought for Proposed Research on Hurricane Ivan Impact in the Offshore Gulf of Mexico".  The MMS web site has descriptions of TA&R activities, the scope of MMS interests, and past hurricane projects. The web site address is http://www.mms.gov/tarp/safety.htm. We encourage interested parties to view the information presented on the site when considering submitting White Papers. BACKGROUND:  In September 2004, Hurricane Ivan, a full category-4 storm, moved through the U.S. Gulf of Mexico (GOM) with extreme winds and large waves exceeding or matching the 100-year design criteria of the facilities in its path. MMS plans to analyze and assess the consequential damage to structures and pipelines, determine the effectiveness of current design standards and pollution-prevention systems and develop recommendations for changes, if needed, to industry standards and MMS regulations. As a result of the White Papers submitted in accordance with the terms of this announcement, selected proposals shall be requested. Projects selected for eventual funding by MMS shall receive funding from FY 2005 (October 01, 2004 through September 30, 2005) funds. THE MMS ANTICIPATES THAT APPROXIMATELY $400,000 MAY BE AVAILABLE FOR THE INITIATION OF NEW RESEARCH PROPOSALS ADDRESSING HURRICANE IVAN TOPICS IN FY 2005 WITH PROJECTS BEING IDENTIFIED THROUGH THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  TYPICAL PROJECTS ENVISIONED TO ADDRESS THE TOPICS SET FORTH BELOW MAY REQUIRE ONE QUARTER TO ONE MAN-YEAR EFFORT and prospective offerors shall bear this in mind when responding to this request. NOTICE:  The MMS may share the White Papers with other organizations for review.  Potential contractors shall notify the MMS if they do not want their White Papers/proposals shared.  OBJECTIVES: The proposed topics for the FY 2005 Hurricane Ivan activities should be limited to the following 5 activities: 1. Examine and review Mobile Offshore Drilling Unit (MODU) loss of station keeping ability during Hurricane Ivan and assess current mooring standards and criteria to prevent similar failures. 2. Examine and review the platform rigs that experienced unintentional rig skidding as well as recommendations to prevent reoccurrence, to include a discussion on deck velocity changes.  3. Assess and evaluate pipeline damage caused by Hurricane Ivan.   4. Assess and evaluate platform damage caused by Hurricane Ivan and compare current damage with damage sustained during Hurricanes Lili and Andrew.  These results will then be used in validating the adequacy of current design methodology and standards.   5 Examine and review the mudflow/mudslide areas in the Gulf of Mexico caused by Hurricane Ivan.  Include a discussion on any changes in the mudflow/mudslide areas over the past 40 years.  This will help to design new pipelines and structures in these areas.  HOW TO RESPOND: White Papers, of not more than five (5) pages in length, an ORGINAL PLUS three (3) copies and one (1) electronic copy in .PDF format, on a CD, shall be submitted to the U.S. Department of Interior, Minerals Management Service, 381 Elden St., Herndon, VA 20170-4817, not later than January 27, 2005 at 04:00 PM, EDT. WHITE PAPERS SENT THROUGH EMAIL AND FAXES SHALL NOT BE ACCEPTED. White Papers shall define the proposed research scope and include the level of effort. NOTE THAT COST ESTIMATES ARE NOT TO BE INCLUDED. The White Papers shall be evaluated only on technical merits. IF YOUR WHITE PAPER IS SELECTED FOR FURTHER EVALUATION, A TECHNICAL AND COST/BUSINESS PROPOSAL SHALL BE REQUESTED FROM YOUR COMPANY.  Projects shall be selected from all or part of the technical issues listed depending on the interest and scope of White Papers received. The MMS shall evaluate the responses, and those deemed to have merit shall be furnished information to assist in the preparation of the technical and cost/business proposal. This announcement constitutes a Request for Proposal (RFP), but does not obligate the Government to consummate award. Respondents SHALL NOT be notified of the results of the evaluation on the information submitted. WHITE PAPERS SHALL BE EVALUATED USING THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA: (1) feasibility of the approach or solution; (2) the offerors understanding of the technical issues; (3) the offerors ability to implement the proposed approach; (4) innovative or creative approaches or solutions including the participation and/or funding by the oil and gas industry or other groups in the research industry interest exists, where appropriate; (5) past performance. QUESTIONS shall be E-mailed to Michael.Hargrove@mms.gov and Paula.Barksdale@mms.gov.  RFP number 39065 MUST be in the subject line of the E-mail. All questions shall include the RFP number, your full name and title, your organization, complete address, and telephone and fax numbers.  TELEPHONE INQUIRES SHALL NOT BE ACCEPTED. A separate White Paper shall be submitted for each study on which the offeror wishes to propose. The White Paper shall identify clearly the offeror's company/organization, point of contact, address, telephone and facsimile numbers. Responses shall be accepted ONLY until January 27, 2005, 04:00 p.m., EDT.  If offerors desire to hand deliver their White Papers, they are advised the MMS facility is a secure office complex and offerors MUST NOT enter the building beyond the lobby.

This model has four tiers, ranging from entry-level employees in Level I to senior executives in Level IV.  It focuses on eight core competencies, which are used to develop training, select new employees and serve as a basis for promotion decisions.  These competencies include:  Interpersonal Effectiveness, Customer Service, Systems Thinking, Flexibility/Adaptability, Creative Thinking, Organizational Stewardship, Personal Mastery, and Technical Skills.  HPDM facilitates career development through continuous learning, coaching/mentoring and continuous assessment throughout a career span.  Progression from one tier to another in the model is based on successfully competing for promotions using a performance-based interview system, which focuses on demonstrated success in core competencies.  The model increases access to training and development for a larger percentage of the workforce, allowing the entire VHA to move forward together rather than just developing a new breed of leaders at the top.  The model increases the pool of potential executive leaders who come to the pool with a broader level of experience in both line and staff positions.  ·	Leader:  A leader is a senior-level manager within the VA medical center.

Leads the planning team in the development of the implementation plan for the medical center. ·	Service Recovery:  A process in which Washington DC VA Medical Center employees listen carefully to veterans about how their service expectations could have been better met and sets into motion ways to affirm our commitment to exceed their satisfaction. ·	VA Survey of Healthcare Experiences of Patients (SHEP) Report:  Presidential Executive Order 12862 was issued in September 1993.  This Executive Order required agencies to publish customer service standards, survey their respective customers and use customer feedback information to manage the agency.  Veteran patient satisfaction surveying is designed to promote health care quality assessment and improvement strategies that address patients' needs and concerns as defined by patients.  In 1995, VHA began surveying its patients using a standardized instrument modeled from the Picker Institute, a non-profit health care surveying group -- Surveys of the Healthcare Experiences of Patients (SHEP).  SHEP Survey Reports are published electronically.  These reports give Network, facility, bed section and community-based outpatient clinic level data (where applicable) and comparisons, including statistical variance from the National mean and an external referent, where applicable.   The contractor shall provide five (5) copies of the package.  The training package should focus on the following evaluation factors:   (1).  Project Team (staff) qualifications and experience (30%) (2).  Past performance in contracts of a similar scope and nature (health related, length of project, changes, and cost) (30%)  (3).

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) intends to modify, on a sole source basis, Contract HQ0006-01-C-0001 with The Boeing Company, to develop a Sea-Based Test X-band Radar (XBR) capability in support of the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) Program. This action will provide for the Sea-Based Test XBR capability design, development, acquisition of a sea-based platform, and modification of the platform and existing XBR to meet design requirements, integration and operational check-out, and radar test operations.  Currently, Boeing is providing development of initial components of the GMD system (interceptor, XBR, and upgrades to the Early Warning Radars) under this contract.  A sea-based platform for the Test XBR is required to support the expanded test operations of the GMD component of the Ballistic Missile Defense System Test Bed.  The effort necessary to satisfy this Sea-Based Test XBR capability is highly specialized and tightly interwoven with the on-going GMD development efforts being provided by Boeing.  No other source can meet this requirement without the intimate knowledge of, and the ability to provide the currently planned XBR element for installation on the sea-based platform and integration into the GMD system under this contract.  See numbered note 22.

<CONTACT>David Newsom, Trade & Industry Analyst - NATO Company Certification, Phone 202-482-7417, Fax 202-482-5650, Email dnewsom@bis.doc.gov
<DESC>NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) plans to release a notification of intent to issue an invitation for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) concerning its plan to procure a Bi-Strategic Command (Bi-SC) Automated Information System (AIS) Core Geographic Services Capability as part of the overall project to provide a final Geographic Information System (GIS) throughout the NATO Command Structure, and in support of the Kosovo Force (KFOR) and the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan.

The need for spatial awareness amongst planners and decision makers has migrated from a total dependency on analogue products (maps and textual reports) to a high dependency on digital products supported by and within Information Systems (IS).  The current situation is characterized by heterogeneous stovepipe/isolated GIS solutions implemented throughout NATO C2 systems.  Nearly all of those solutions have different GIS implementations, using/maintaining a wide variety of proprietary file formats and data access mechanisms. As such, interoperability of data and functions is quasi non-existent and leads to manpower intensive, expensive data conversions and high software license and maintenance cost.  To rectify this situation, NATO has started to implement the following concept whereby the NATO Bi-SC AIS is now segmented into core services and functional services. Core services are those which have a common user requirement e.g. email, document management, messaging etc. Functional services are domain specific services providing capability to specific functional groups, e.g. Intel, logistics etc.  As such, Geographic Services are seen as core services.  The Bi-SC AIS Core Geographic Services project is aimed at providing NATO Strategic and Subordinate Commands with Geographic Services, implemented through the Bi-SC AIS.

This project will be funded under the NATO Security Investment Program (NSIP).  The successful contractor may be required to handle and store material at the level of NATO SECRET and therefore, prospective bidders must have (or be able to obtain) appropriate security clearance for storage and handling of such information.  Prospective bidders should also be aware that contractor personnel may be called upon to work at a NATO site in connection with the contract and such contractor personnel will be required to have security clearances to the level of NATO SECRET.  All such personnel clearances must be in place prior to contract award.

ALL FIRMS INTERESTED IN PARTICIPATING IN THIS PROCUREMENT MUST BE CERTIFIED AND NOMINATED BY THEIR NATIONAL DELEGATIONS WITH THE REQUIRED DECLARATION OF ELIGIBILITY.  REQUESTS FOR PARTICIPATION RECEIVED DIRECTLY FROM FIRMS CAN NOT BE CONSIDERED.  The deadline for interested and qualified firms to be certified and nominated to the bidder list is 13 January 2005.  YOUR FIRM MUST BE CERTIFIED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE IN ORDER TO RECEIVE BID MATERIALS FOR THIS PROCUREMENT.  THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE DOES NOT SERVE AS THE CONTRACTING AGENCY FOR NATO PROJECTS.  NC3A IS THE CONTRACTING ENTITY.  The Invitation For Bid (IFB) is planned to be issued in February 2005 with a bid closing date in June 2005 and contract award in September 2005.  Only firms the U.S. Department of Commerce has declared eligible and has nominated to the bidders list by the 13 January 2005 deadline will be allowed to bid.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT AN INVITATION FOR BID OR A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. 
Description of project:  Contractor will furnish all labor, material, supervision and equipment to construct the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center (NBACC) Facility at Fort Detrick, Frederick, Maryland.  The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has identified the need to establish modern secure biocontainment facilities and provide technologies, products and capabilities to support DHS in fulfilling its responsibilities with respect to terrorist attack and major disasters involving biological threat agents (BTA).  The NBACC facility will be located on the National Interagency Biodefense Campus (NIBC) at Fort Detrick and will serve to establish an enduring national capability to anticipate, prevent, respond to, and recover from bioterrorist attack.  The NBACC project will establish a facility comprised of biocontainment laboratories at the BSL (biosafety) 2, 3, & 4 levels with the capability to conduct testing of aerosolized high hazard threat agents against animals, bench research on threat agents, and bioforensics analysis.  The proposed 160,000 square foot building, which will be a stand-alone facility in terms of utilities, will provide a full-scale operational bioforensics capability and a smaller, but still significant, capability to perform threat characterization research of biothreat agents.    The Government intends to utilize the Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) concept for this procurement.  Under this contract the CMc will function as a collaborative member of the project team and shall be an active participant in pre-construction by providing expertise during the design process (e.g., checking estimates, performing constructability reviews, and design mockups).  The CMc is responsible for all construction, construction supervision, and inspection responsibilities.  The services requested of the CMc shall cover a wide range of design and construction activities which are often performed by both Construction Managers and general contractors.  The CMc must maintain a team with the expertise and capability to manage and coordinate the timely and orderly development and construction of the proposed project.  The CMC shall be required to assign, as needed, a team consisting of architectural, civil, structural, mechanical and electrical reviewers; cost estimators; CPM analysts; field engineers; field support staff; construction supervisors ; construction superintendents; testing engineers/technicians; and other disciplines.  The CMc shall provide the FLETC with sound management advice regarding the approach to the project, how to achieve the best value in the work being accomplished, schedule control, alternative ideas, problem prevention, and budgeting.  The CMc shall have a full understanding of the project, its contract documents, and the principles of Federal construction contracting and contract administration.  Most importantly, the CMc shall have complete responsibility for construction of the facility.  At a pre-determined point in the design phase, likely at about 70%, a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) will be negotiated and construction of the project will begin.  The CMc will be contractually bound to pay for costs that exceed the GMP unless the Government changes the scope.  The estimated construction cost is $100 million, to include the CMc’s Preconstruction and Construction Phase Services. This procurement will be negotiated on a best value basis in accordance with FAR 15.101, based primarily on a trade-off between technical qualifications, present/past performance, and price, with all evaluation factors other than price, when combined, considered significantly more important than price.  The best overall value to the Government includes demonstrating a commitment to construction excellence, providing and maintaining a viable team organization and adherence to the budgetary and time parameters for this project.   Offerors will be evaluated on relevant corporate experience, past performance on relevant contracts where the offeror acted as prime contractor or CMc, Key Personnel, to include experience and qualification of proposed staff, and price.  The price proposal will include pricing of the CMc’s cost of Pre-construction Services and a total fee for Construction Phase Services, including profit, General Conditions, and other overhead costs.  Interested firms should, as early as possible, but no later than December 30, 2004, indicate interest in this acquisition by letter (no more than 2 typewritten pages), referencing the solicitation number, with a brief summary of experience in relevant contracts (scope and magnitude) where the offeror acted as a prime contractor or CMc, particularly in the construction of level 2, 3, and 4 laboratories, or similar facilities.  The offeror should describe its performance of the pre-design and construction phase services provided.  The letter should clearly identify the business size, i.e., large business, small business, 8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB, etc.  Due to the estimated value of this project, the letter must also provide the offerors bonding capacity (single project and aggregate limit).  Letters should be sent to the attention of Bob Driggers, Contracting Officer, at the contracting office address listed above, preferably as an e-mail attachment.  More detailed present/past performance information will be required with proposals.  In response to the solicitation, offerors will be required to demonstrate their ability to perform projects of a similar scope and magnitude, perform quality work, complete projects on schedule, and at a reasonable price.  Award of the resulting contract will not necessarily be made to the lowest priced offeror.  It is the intent of the Government to negotiate and award a contract to a well qualified firm with extensive experience in performing projects of similar scope and magnitude.  The Government anticipates significant subcontracting activity under this contract.  The solicitation will be available about the end of February, 2005, with proposals due about mid-April, 2005.  The Government’s final procurement strategy will be based on the responses from qualified firms.  If you are interested in this solicitation, please provide the information required above, point of contact, company phone, fax number and e-mail address, to Bob Driggers, Contracting Officer, phone 912-261-3630, fax 912-280-5343, or email: Bob.Driggers@dhs.gov or Paulette Webster, Procurement Technician, phone 912-554-4613, email: Paulette.Webster@dhs.gov no later than December 30, 2004.

Attached:  Statement of Work:  Third Party Draft System The Contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, material, equipment, services and facilities (except as otherwise specified), to perform the Statement of Work and Specifications included herein: C.1    Definitions and Terms used in this SOW 	AOC (Accounting Operations Center): This is the central finance office of the National Park Service.  Located in Herndon, Virginia. 	Check 21 Technology:  New legislation that allows for the creation of a new negotiable instrument a "Substitute Check".  This instrument can be used in the same way the original could be used in the check clearing process. 	Cleared Draft:  A payment instrument becomes cleared on the day that it is honored by the Contractor.  Payment-stopped and dishonored drafts are not tallied in the number of cleared drafts. 	COTR  (Contracting Officer's Technical Representative): A Government employee designated by the agency to perform contract administrative activities on behalf of the Contracting Officer within the limits of delegated authority.  In general, the COTR has the day-to-day responsibilities for ensuring that the contractor performs in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract. Draft Site: Any National Park Service unit that has an authorized draft writer. The site may be located anywhere within the US and US territories. 	Draft Agent:  Any person who is authorized by the NPS and the Contactor to issue and sign third party drafts that are to be cashed by employees or vendors. 	FFS  (Federal Financial System): Mainframe computer based accounting system used by the National Park Service.  The program was originally developed by American Management Systems (AMS) and is written in COBOL.  It uses VSAM files to organize and store accounting data into tables.  Each type of transaction; e.g., receivables, payables, fixed assets, etc has its own subsystem designed to handle that type of transaction. 	Fiscal Year:  The fiscal year used by the National Park Service is from October 1 through September 30.  	HHS Payment Management System (PMS) SmartLink:  A payment system serviced by the Department of Health and Human Services. Reimbursement of funds can be electronically transferred to the Contractor within one day. 	MICR ( Magnetic Ink Character Recognition): The machine-readable method that enables drafts to be processed through the Automated Clearing House (ACH) check processing system.  The MICR characters are routing numbers and account numbers that are imprinted on the bottom of each draft. 	Payment Instrument:  A financial instrument that resembles a check.  The face amount is drawn against the Contractor's account and paid by the contractor. 	TPD  (Third Party Draft): Refers to the payment instrument provided by the Contractor. 	TPD Site Manager:  An individual authorized by the NPS at each draft site to administer and oversee the operation of the TPD system.  This person accepts delivery of payment instruments and reports that are sent from the Contractor. 	Workdays:  Monday through Friday exclusive of Federal holidays.  C.2 Background The National Park Service (NPS) has used a third-party draft (TPD) system since 1994.  This popular payment option is widely used throughout the NPS, which is comprised of 388 individual park units in every state except Delaware.  Additional park units are located in District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.  The TPD system gives NPS administrative staff the convenience of writing a check for small purchases and payments under $2,500.   The most common payments made using the TPD system are utility payments, miscellaneous transactions, and to vendors who do not accept credit cards. TPD System Description: The TPD system utilizes a payment instrument that resembles a paper multi-copy check.  The drafts are imprinted with Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) linking them to the issuing office.  As the draft is presented for payment, the face amount is cleared against an account maintained by the Contractor.  Once the draft reaches the Contractor all information on the face of each draft is input by the Contractor.  On a nightly basis, the Contractor presents the total of all cleared drafts for reimbursement through the PMS Smart Link System.  PMS Smart Link is an Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) system that is administered by Health and Human Services (HHS).  The next business day the contractor sends an electronic data file to the NPS Accounting Operations Center (AOC).  This data file contains the daily cleared and rejected draft information with the associated transaction information.  At this time the previous day's activity is then uploaded into the Federal Financial System (FFS) the NPS accounting system.  The Contractor is required to provide daily and monthly transaction reports to aid in reconciliation and management of the system. C.3 Scope of Work The NPS requires contracting services to implement and maintain a TPD payment system that allows the agency to make selected payments using payment instruments rather than cash.  The system requires a controlled, third party draft or it's equivalent, using 'Check 21' electronic technology.  The draft will be drawn on the Contractor's account and will be reimbursed on a daily basis as described in section C.8. The contractor must be able to service approximately 1,500 draft agents issuing about 100,000 drafts annually, with total payments estimated at 30 million dollars.  The TPD system is used throughout the NPS as a regular payment system. Utilization of the system between Draft sites varies widely with heavy use in some locations and just a few drafts issued a year for other sites.  Drafts must be negotiable in all fifty states and US territories. C.4 System Design The TPD system uses a third-party payment instrument or its equivalent using "Check 21" technology.  Section J, Attachments 1 and 2 describes the two draft types.  One format could be an 8 1/2 by 11 laser-jet printer compatible draft imprinted with MICR and at least two perforated distribution copies. The second type could be a multi-copy document, configured as an original draft with two copies; it will also be imprinted with MICR.  Draft copy distribution is as follows:  the original draft will go to the payee, one copy is included with the draft writer's files and one copy for the unit or units incurring the expense covered by the draft payment. The NPS has established procedures that require each draft site to designate both a TPD draft agent and a TPD site manager. The draft agent is authorized to issue and sign drafts; the site manager oversees operations, receives and controls all replacement drafts and receives the monthly reports. The Contractor is required to maintain a list and information on both of these types of individuals for each site. At the time of contract award, AOC will provide the Contractor with a list of authorized draft sites, site managers and draft agents.  The Contractor will provide and store signature cards or a signature verification system for all draft agents.  Any additions, deletions, and changes made to this list will be provided in writing to the Contractor by the park or office using the system.  Site managers will be responsible for submitting signatures of newly authorized employees. Draft agents will issue these payment instruments in lieu of cash.  Individual payment instruments shall be limited to $2,500.  This maximum amount will be reviewed annually and may be changed during the course of the contract.  Initially there will be no minimum dollar amount but one may be implemented.  The payee must negotiate the draft within 60 days or it will be stale dated. The payment instruments will be processed through the ACH banking system or Check 21 system and presented to the Contractor for acceptance.  The following system controls are required: "	Signature verification "	Dollar limit per draft  $2,500. "	Stop payment capability "	Date verification, drafts go stale after 60 days, and postdated checks are not honored "	Any alterations to the dollar amount indicating possible fraud C.5 Services to be Provided by the Contractor The Contractor will provide the following services and information deemed necessary to implement and operate the TPD system: Payment Instruments: Print and deliver numbered, pre-MICRed instruments with a sequence number that incorporates the draft site organization code (a 4 digit code used in FFS to ID the site where the draft originated). Initial delivery of drafts by the Contractor to the site manager will be within 45 calendar days after award of contract.  Telephone, written, Fax, or e-mail requests for replacement drafts will come directly to the Contractor from the site manager.  These subsequent deliveries shall be made to the site manager within 30 calendar days of the request. Liability: Assume liability against forged drafts, stop payment drafts, and against the required system controls described within this document.  See section C.4. Draft Storage and Retrieval: Copies of cleared payment instruments will be stored at the Contractors' site in industry standard format either electronically, CD-ROM, or similar system.  The Contractor will store copies of all drafts written during the fiscal year ending September 30th.  The NPS must be able to request and obtain front and back copies of any cleared or rejected drafts for a period of 3 years after the close of the fiscal year.  Retrieval of drafts using the Internet is encouraged. The Contractor will not charge any additional fees for this service. Signature Verification: Prepare and maintain an electronic list of authorized draft agents, sites and site managers.  Maintain signature cards or other type of signature verification for authorized draft agents and site managers.  Make timely additions and deletions to the list as requested by the park or office using the system. Validation & Reimbursement: Provide validation of all payment instruments each day as they clear and are presented to NPS for acceptance and payment.  On a daily basis all drafts that clear are totaled and presented to the PMS Smart Link system for acceptance and reimbursement. Draft Data Capture: Input all keyed data from the face of each draft of up to 26 characters, plus additional keystrokes for control purposes, in 80 character length records. Or the contractor will provide a method for Third Party Draft information (i.e. document number, cost account information, budget object code, dollar amount etc) to be captured from the face of the draft and transmitted back to the NPS accounting system (FFS) in an electronic file. List of Authorized Draft Agents and Site Managers: Prepare and maintain a list of authorized draft agents and site managers, and make changes to this list as prescribed by Parks or offices using system. Electronic Data Transmission File: Prepare electronic data files for transmission by noon each workday.  The transmission file needs to conform to NPS specifications. It should include all instruments that clear as well as all instruments that reject for any reason.  In addition, the file should include any captured transaction data from the face of the Draft. Reports: Reports shall be made available in printed format or electronic format as specified by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR).  Printed reports shall be produced and mailed to the AOC and to the individual draft sites at no cost the Government.   Reports that are on a monthly cycle are due 14 days after the end of the month.  The minimum reports are: 1.	A daily transaction summary report sheet that is faxed, e-mailed or made available over the internet each transaction day.   This report will be used in the daily reconciliation process and will provide a check of Contractor reimbursement through HHS.  This report needs to include: "	Total number of drafts presented for payment. "	Gross amount of all drafts presented for payment. "	The number of drafts presented but not paid (returns). A daily report of dishonored drafts (returns) for each workday.  This portion of the daily report will include: amount of each draft, draft number, document number, reject date and a copy of the front and back of each rejected draft. "	The net reimbursement amount requested from HHS. "	Any adjustments or corrections, with an explanation, that were credited or charged for the transaction day. 2.	The Contractor must be able to produce a report of currently authorized draft agents, site managers and draft sites. This report will be made available to the AOC or individual site managers.  This list must be updated as draft agents and site managers are added and deleted. 3.	A monthly transaction statement, including rejects, will be generated for each draft site and made available to the site manager through e-mail or contractors' website. 4.	A monthly transaction report, including rejects, will be generated for the entire TPD system.  This report will be made available to AOC only in either a paper statement, e-mailed, downloadable file or by FTP. 5.	The NPS reserves the right to revise any of these reports or create new reports throughout the life of the contract. Communication with the Contractor: Provide a way for TPD system users to directly contact the Contractor. Inquiries can be made through either a toll-free number that is staffed for at least 8 hours each workday, through FAX, e-mail or the Contractors' website.  The following questions will need to be addressed: "	Payment, error, and reconciliation problems. "	Reporting lost or stolen payment instruments. "	Requesting copies of drafts. "	Stop payment requests. C.6 Deliverables Deliverables: "	Numbered and MICR imprinted payment instruments, including either laser jet or multicopy type drafts as described in section C.5. "	Samples of drafts prior to production or changes. "	File format/layout of the daily activity file will be provided by the COTR. "	Documentation describing the Contractor's system functions, operations and procedures.  Five copies will be sent within 14 calendar days after award of contract. See address in section C.7.

C.7 Pricing the Service Cost of the service and its maintenance will be assessed on the basis of the number of drafts processed, without extra price consideration for reports, draft-printing charges, changes to keying instructions or other requirements or deliverables in this statement of work. Payments to the Contractor for this service will be subject to provisions of the Prompt Payment Act of 1982.   C.8  Reimbursable Practices NPS will reimburse the Contractor for payment instruments cleared on a daily basis by electronic transfer through the PMS Smart Pay System administered by the Department of Health and Human Services.  In the event of a discrepancy between the payment instrument cleared data and the payment instrument issued data, the NPS will adjust a subsequent payment to the Contractor upon mutual agreement. In the event that PMS Smart Pay become unavailable and same day reimbursement does not take place, the float charges take affect.  When the disbursement program is back on-line the float payment will be included with the reimbursement payments for the drafts that cleared on that date. Payments under the contract for cleared drafts are reimbursements for the use of the Contractor's funds and are governed by the specific terms of this contract.   They are not subject to the 30-day holding period of the Prompt Payment Act of 1982. Per draft cleared charges shall be invoiced to the NPS on a monthly basis.  These reimbursements are subject to the Prompt Payment Act of 1982. See government-wide numbered notes 22 and 26.

<CONTACT>Shelia Thompson, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-307-3070, Fax 202-307-2780, Email sthompson@bop.gov
<DESC>Response Date: (45 days from issuance of RFI)
This announcement is posted as a Request for Information (RFI) only.  The Bureau of Prisons is conducting Market Research that may result in a future solicitation being posted on the Federal Business Opportunity (www.fedbizopps.gov) website.  This RFI is issued to determine whether there are qualified sources that will be able to meet the requirements, as well as, allow industry an opportunity to provide comment concerning the requirement.  The requirement is for Re-Entry and Service Planning (RASP) for male and female Federal offenders held under the authority of the United States Statutes with special medical and/or mental health needs who are releasing or transferring to community-based programs from Bureau institutions. 

Sources are sought who can provide service plans, program referrals, and scheduling for community treatment and support services, (e.g., mental health, medical, Social Security Income (SSI), housing assistance, substance abuse treatment, etc.) for the time period immediately following the inmate’s release from custody or transfer to a community-based program.   Sources should provide comments concerning, or sources for; 1) the development of structured and comprehensive re-entry and service plans (RASP) ; and 2) the referral and scheduling of necessary treatment and services for specifically identified offenders in advance of their re-entry to the community. 
   
A previous sample of releasing federal offenders revealed that around 15 percent of releasees had a severe medical and/or mental health problems.  Of this group, approximately 60 percent were released directly to the community and the remainder were transferred to Community Corrections Centers (CCC), also known as halfway houses, or Home Confinement.   About 18 percent of this group were diagnosed with a severe mental health problem-only and 72 percent were diagnosed with a medical condition and/or a co-occurring mental health problem.  Such diagnoses require swift and certain follow-up during the inmate’s  re-entry to the community.  During fiscal year 2004, approximately 50,000 offenders were released from BOP institutions.  Estimates based on our previous sample, indicate that about 7,500 of these offenders would have benefitted from RASP type services.   Traditionally, Bureau staff coordinate release planning for offenders leaving Bureau custody or transferring to CCCs.   However, to provide additional re-entry services to higher need offenders, the Bureau is exploring various planning options.  Linking offenders in need of specialized treatment and program services is essential to ensuring a continuum of care during the re-entry period.  

RASP development would be done on a case-by-case basis.  This would be based on case specific documentation which would be supplied by Bureau staff.  Bureau staff would be available for clarifying information as needed.  Only in rare circumstances would actual interviews with offenders take place.  Based upon the RASP, referrals for identified services would be made and any necessary treatment and/or service appointments would be scheduled (contingent upon the inmate’s identified release date).  After the RASP is developed and all necessary scheduling completed, the RASP and referral information would be returned to Bureau staff. 

Sources should describe their ability to develop a transition treatment plan and the existing relationships which demonstrate their ability to link offenders with the services identified in the  treatment plan. These services will include, but are not limited to: 

•	medical and mental health assessments;
•	medical and mental health treatment; 
•	continuation/follow-up prescriptions for medication;
•	services for those with developmental disabilities;
•	employment services; 
•	housing assistance; 
•	substance abuse treatment and/or support services; 
•	educational/vocational referrals; 
•	parenting skills; 
•	family counseling and reintegration into the family;
•	SSI/Social Security Disability (SSD) applicant advocacy;
•	public assistance advocacy; and
•	child care referrals.   

The Bureau operates over 107 federal institutions across the country and offenders often release from institutions geographically distance from their proposed release residence, complicating service and treatment linkages.  Consequently, the responses must include the a description of the responder’s ability and/or approach to provide services on a State-wide, regional or national basis.  

Your response should be no more than ten pages, and should include a discussion of the viability of the re-entry and service planning approach. Responses shall be addressed to Sheila Thompson, Contracting Officer via email at sthompson@bop.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Draft  RFP Number: W9113M-05-R-0003. The US Army Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC) supports a Missile Defense Agency requirement for accomplishing lethality testing and assessments.  This effort will define kill modes, determine lethal damage requirements  (LDRs), and develop/validate lethality criteria for threat configurations designated as targets for the Ballistic Missile Defense System elements and components.  Near-term focus is on the Ground Based Midcourse Defense and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense systems.  This will be do ne through testing and analysis for current Kinetic Energy Weapons (KEW) systems and concepts but also may require the development of LDRs associated with targets for directed energy weapons or small yield nuclear weapons.  Determination of LDRs for the KE I, MKV, Aegis BMD and ABL systems are within the scope of this procurement.  The effort consists of designing, fabricating, instrumenting and testing models of threat payload targets and/or models of interceptors and kill enhancement devices such as rods a nd fragments.  First principle computational analyses consisting of hydrocodes, and/or structural codes are required to develop pre-test predictions, interpret test data and design threat payload and interceptor test models.  These analytical techniques wi ll also be utilized to extend the empirical database beyond current test capabilities and conduct parametric analyses.  Fast-running computer algorithms, which accurately model the critical parameters of the empirical database, are required in this effort for development of lethality criteria, evaluations of interceptor lethality, and other parametric analyses.  This acquisition will not be open to participation by foreign firms at either the prime or subcontract level.  The proposed acquisition may involve a potential conflict of interest as set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 9.5.  The resultant c ontract will be cost plus award fee, level of effort.  The procurement will be full and open competition and will result in one contract award.  It will consist of a one-year basic, four (4) one-year options and a surge option, as well as a material CLIN a nd a Travel CLIN.  The Government does not intend to limit either the number or types of teaming arrangements entered into by the potential offerors (i.e., any given contractor could propose as a prime contractor as well as participate a subcontractor on o ne or more other proposing teams).  Further, we do not intend to impose any restrictions on team membership after award. The purpose of this synopsis is to advise that the Draft Request for Proposal (RFP) is scheduled to be issued on about 10 Dec 2004.  The Final RFP is scheduled to be issued on or about 29 January 2005 with a closing date approximately forty-five (45) days after RFP issuance.  The Draft RFP and RFP, when released, will be available at the SMDC website, http://www.smdc.army.mil/Contracts/Contracts.html.  Any questions regarding the Draft RFP should be submitted to shirley.wilkes@smdc.army.mil (title email 'Le thality Testing and Criteria Development') by close of business 28 Dec 04.  NO PAPER COPIES OF THE DRAFT RFP OR THE RFP WILL BE PROVIDED, NOR IS A MAILING LIST BEING MAINTAINED FOR THIS ACQUISITION, AS BOTH THE DRAFT RFP AND THE RFP WILL BE POSTED ON THE A BOVE WEBSITE.

<DESC>The New England District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has been tasked by the Department of Homeland Security (former Immigration and Naturalization Service INS) to design and construct two new replacement Border Patrol Stations on the northern Maine  border, one each in Calais (Baileyville) and Jackman, Maine. These new Border Patrol Stations are required to accommodate future staff increases and are intended to replace existing stations.  Sites have been selected. In Calais, the new Border Patrol Sta tion will be constructed in the Baileyville Industrial Park on Route 1 and in Jackman, the new Border Patrol Station will be constructed on Route 6/15 in Jackman.  It is expected that construction for this project will begin during the early summer of 2004  with construction completion scheduled for one year later  early summer of 2005. Occupancy by the Border Patrol is required by mid march 2005. Because of this, a winter shutdown is not envisioned as this work must be accomplished on schedule. The Corps of  Engineers will be performing construction management services for this contract.  Work to be done hereunder includes furnishing of all labor, equipment and materials, to perform all work required for the construction of two new Border Patrol Stations as i ndicated in the plans and specifications. Each Border Patrol Station will be constructed on a minimum 10-acre site and will consist of an approximately minimum 10,000 sf commercial building with options that could potentially double the building size. The Border Patrol Stations will be constructed on wooded lots and will be slab on grade office buildings complete with systems furniture designed to operate 24 hours per day and will include enclosed dog kennels; backup generator; trash dumpster; security syst ems to include fencing; gasoline storage/dispensing; heating oil storage; and flag pole.

The extension of three phase electricity to the Jackman site will be required. It is avaialble at Calais. The remote locations of these proposed Border Patrol Stations, the extreme winter weather conditions, and the expedited construction completion requirements are of the utmost concern that must be accounted for by prospective contractors. Work will be required during the winter  in order to meet the schedule. The estimated issue date is on or about January 21, 2004.  The proposed action is unrestricted.  The NAICS code is 236220 with a size standard of $28.5 million.  No paper copies of the solicitation or amendments will be avai lable. The firms interested must register to receive the solicitation.

<DESC>The TSA's Security Technology Deployment Office (STDO) is responsible for procuring and deploying technology to support the safety and security of the movement of people and baggage throughout the nation’s airports. STDO is responsible for ensuring that Explosive Trace Detection (ETD) systems and technologies provide airport level security benefits. STDO is planning for the modernization of the current ETD system which will support both legacy and new functional capabilities.

This announcement is being conducted to select qualified technical sources that can compete for a contract to manufacture and deploy state of the art ETD systems.  This contract shall also have options for Training Tasks and Engineering Services on an as-ordered basis by the Government. Projected award of a contract is anticipated by June 2005, with a period of performance from the date of award for a minimum of one (1) year and a maximum of five (5) years inclusive of all options. The Government requires unlimited rights to all data and computer software produced under this contract in accordance with the acquisition method being used.  
In order to make a determination of qualified bidders, the TSA requires the following qualification information from interested sources:

1.  A one-page Notice of Interest delivered to Ms. Patricia Newton by 4:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) December 22, 2004.  The notice of interest shall identify the Offeror’s proposed ETD equipment for the forthcoming ETD manufacture and deployment RFP.  Offerors shall identify the make, model and country of manufacture for each ETD equipment proposed for TSA consideration. 

2.  Transportation Security Lab (TSL) Certification:  Offeror must submit, at no cost to the Government, a Production Sample Machine(s) to the TSL to be used as the test system for Certification.  During the Certification testing, the Offeror must provide testing support at no cost to the Government.  Offerors, who comply with the Notice of Interest submission requirements, will be notified of the certification testing schedule and Production Sample Machine delivery dates.  Failure to deliver the Production Sample Machine(s) by the delivery date may result in a non-responsive determination by the Contracting Officer and remove the Offeror from further consideration for this procurement.  It is anticipated that Certification testing will be conducted in January 2005.    

3.  Operational Utility Evaluation (OUE):  Offeror must provide, at no cost to the Government, five (5) production machines for an OUE upon successful completion of Certification testing.  Offerors will be notified as to their exact OUE testing schedule.  During the OUE, the offeror must provide testing support at no cost to the Government.  The OUE period of performance is anticipated to last 3 months.  Failure to provide equipment and/or support for OUE may result in a non-responsive determination by the Contracting Officer and remove the Offeror from further consideration for this procurement.

Only qualified sources will be permitted to submit an ETD proposal.  After all testing is completed, a Qualified Vendor’s List (QVL) will be established.  Only those Offerors who appear on the QVL will receive a Request for Proposal (RFP) providing the opportunity to compete for an ETD production, training and engineering services contract. The Government reserves the right to open up the QVL again, at the convenience of the Government.  Interested parties responding to this announcement letter should carefully consider if they have all the expertise required to meet the Government's expected tasking. The purpose of the evaluation is to identify those Offerors that have the expertise, interest, and capabilities to perform these tasks.  Cost information is not requested at this time.

This announcement is for informational purposes only and shall not be construed as a commitment or a promise of a contract by the Government. This announcement does not commit the Government to pay any costs incurred in the submission of responses.



3.2.2.3-6 Submittals in the English Language (April 1996)

Submittals in response to this Screening Information Request (SIR) shall be in the English language. Submittals received in other than English shall be rejected.

·	Support global strike missions
·	Address a variety of targets
·	Address targets deep within future high threat anti-access environments 
·	Reduce minimum and extend maximum range of current cruise missiles
·	Improve accuracy compared to current cruise missiles. 
·	Be carried on strategic bomber aircraft as well as alternative launchers (ground, sea, missile, etc.)
·	Exploit altitude and missile velocity regimes
	
	2.	The ECM study team encourages cruise missile system integrators and developers to become involved with this process by responding to this RFI.  The RFI response can consist of pre-existing product documentation, but should preferably be organized and presented in accordance with this RFI.

3.	This RFI seeks information to help the ECM study team make useful and efficient assessment of the ability of the aerospace industry to develop and produce a nuclear ECM that offers improvements over existing systems and meets Air Force requirements beyond 2020.  Please consider the purpose of this RFI when responding so your time is spent on addressing the issues in paragraph 1.  Respondents may consider areas not explicitly asked for if they feel the information provides useful guidance.  

4.	Organizations responding to this RFI shall:
·	Designate a single contact within that organization for receipt of all subsequent communications
·	Notify the government of intent to submit a white paper

5.	Responses to this RFI must be received at AFNWCA no later than 5:00 PM US Mountain Time January 7, 2005.  However, earlier responses are encouraged.  
 

6.	The following outline is offered to assist in the development of your response. You should include:

·	A cover letter – this letter should include a brief summary of your response and indicate if supporting documentation is included.
·	Your response must be in the form of an UNCLASSIFIED white paper, submitted in electronic and paper format, which addresses all the areas in paragraph 1.
·	Appropriate “proprietary” markings if applicable.  

7.	Although the ECM study team does not limit the size of responses, you are asked to consider that the team will rely upon resources with limited time availability to review these responses.  In order to assure that your response receives the attention it deserves, you are asked to consider limiting the size of your response (not counting any supporting documentation) to no more than 10 pages.  If you consider supporting documentation to be necessary, please indicate which portions of the supporting documentation are relevant to this RFI.

8.	This RFI does not obligate the government in any manner for any future acquisitions.  This is not a notice of intent to contract. The government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request for information or otherwise pay for information solicited.

9.	All communication regarding this RFI, including submissions, should be sent to the contact below.

Offerors will be required to provide double rates for domestic and overseas personnel to be eligible for award.  Personnel providing CAG and CST services both domestically and overseas, must successfully complete the Department's specialized security training prior to contract assignment.  The government anticipates awarding at least three Indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts with at least one award set-aside for small business.  Each contract shall consist of a one-year base period with four one-year option service periods.  The minimum for each contract is anticipated to be 250K in task orders over the life of a 5-year period.  All offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry to be eligible for award.  Offerors can contact the CCR by calling 1-888-227-2423.

Offerors already possessing the necessary facility clearance should submit their appropriate Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code with their proposal.  If a selected offeror does not possess the necessary facility clearance, the Department of State will sponsor the firm for a facility clearance.  Sponsorship does not guarantee that the firm will receive the clearance.  A period of up to 90 calendar days from the date of final selection of the final offeror(s) will be allowed for the selected firm(s) to obtain the necessary facility clearance.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) is interested in education institution/academic research submissions of capability statements to support efforts under an anticipated Marine Corps Research University (MCRU) type contract relationship environment.  MCSC desires to maintain a contractual relationship with academia to maintain a MCRU strategic relationship initiative.  The purpose of this initiative is to provide the Marine Corps with continued needed capability to respond effectively and rapidly, without reliance on other services’ contractual arrangements, to growing requirements in the areas of Engineering, Scientific Research and Business/Logistics.  The ability to obtain academia services of consistently high quality that builds upon past knowledge and research and to engage academia on a regular basis with minimum procurement lead-time is highly desired.  Key areas for possible tasks under Engineering include; but is not limited to; non-lethal technologies, alternative power sources, human factors, imaging technologies and sensor systems. Key areas for possible tasks under Scientific Research include; but is not limited to; modeling and simulation research, applied research, quantitative analysis, and independent evaluations.  Key areas for possible tasks under Business/Logistics include; but is not limited to; supply chain and logistics technologies, manpower analysis, and developmental technology investment analysis.  It is anticipated that this effort is needed for a period of 12 months with four (4), one (1) year option periods.  In order to allow the MCSC to efficiently task the contractor with minimal procurement lead-time, an indefinite delivery type contract incorporating individual delivery/task orders will most likely be utilized for this effort. Deliverables, period of performance, and work requirements will be defined by the Project Office and identified within each order. 

The MCSC requests that all interested parties submit a capability statement of not more than ten (10) pages submitted on 8.5 by 11 paper at 12 pitch or greater font size, that addresses the following areas:  (1) past Research and Development (R&D) performance, (2) past performance with USMC related R&D efforts, (3) past performance with USMC related academic studies and analysis, (4) in-house capability as it relates to research facilities, faculty, graduate students, etc., (5) existing strategic business partnerships (6) experience as a recognized center of excellence in a particular discipline, (7) capability to perform classified work, and (8) level of experience with Government contracting.  Additionally all respondents are requested to include the resumes of key personnel identified as principle investigators in areas that you are a recognized center of excellence.  Note that the resumes will not be counted as a part of the 10 pages.  The deadline for receipt of capability statements is COB, December 22, 2004.  All capability statements should electronically mailed to dwight.micheal@usmc.mil.  This RFI is not an authorization to incur cost in anticipation of a resultant contract.  Information provided herein is subject to amendment and in no way binds the Government to the award of a contract. Technical questions must be addressed in writing to Dr. Peter Denega, via fax at (703) 432-3322 or via e-mail at denegap@mcsc.usmc.mil.  Contractual questions may be addressed to Mr. Dwight Micheal, Sr., at (703) 432-3740.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities(FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line(NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by NSWC Crane. The Navy is seeking information on a replacement for a power supply to be used in the Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) system.  The Navy wants to find a potential solution and gather technical and cost information to plan and budget for future requirements.  The following are the preliminary requirements of the Power Supply: 1.	12 kilowatts of output power at 270 VDC (no more than 8 kW to be drawn at any time). 2.	Modularized construction so that one section of the power supply can fail and the power supply will still source 8 kilowatts of power. 3.	Output regulation +/- 5% from zero load to maximum load 4.	Ripple maximum +/- 2% 5.	Power supply input characteristics - Mil-STD-1399 section 300 type I power 440 VAC, nominal frequency 60 Hz, +/- 5.5% 6.	440 VAC nominal input 3-phase delta with safety ground 7.	Input power transient withstanding: a.	1 - 10 msec  +/- 1000 Volts peak b.	50 usec +/- 2500 Volts peak 8.	Voltage imbalance line to line or line to ground 3% 9.	Power factor 0.9 10.	Discharge power to less than 30 Volts within 2 seconds of power removal 11.	Isolation to main power of 10 Mohms 12.	Overload protected 13.	Short circuit protected 14.	Operate within +/- 20% under no load conditions 15.	Operate within output specifications with long term line transient of +/- 20% 16.	Component stress levels are not exceeded under input load of +35% 17.	Air cooled/conduction cooled to air heat exchanger The following are features that are desired but not required, with weight given to implementation options that include the desired features but not at a large cost, schedule or size impact.  We prefer that most of the power monitoring occur in the power supply, but not at a significant cost or schedule increase.  Extra circuitry could be added to the system (external to power supply) to address these issues (such as a capacitor bank for the power hold time).  Proposals should address what extra circuitry would be needed to meet these criteria external to the power supply, and how much the cost and delivery schedule of the power supply is affected by inclusion of the various features needed to implement these system requirements. 1.	Rise time from zero to stable power output is 125 milliseconds or less. 2.	Power must be able to switch from a load of 4 killowatts to 8 killowatts while staying within tolerance. 3.	A power hold time of at least 50 milliseconds is required after loss of primary power. 4.	System must detect when the power supply is operating out of voltage range high. 5.	System must detect when the power supply is operating out of voltage range low. 6.	System must detect when a phase of the 440 VAC primary power has been lost. 7.	System must detect when the power supply is operating out of current range high. 8.	System must detect when the power supply is operating out of temperature range high. 9.	A green light is needed for each module of the power supply to indicate that the module is functioning properly. 10.	A red light is needed for each module of the power supply to indicate that the module is not functioning properly. Respondents should include in submittal the following: proposed approach (including pictures, if available), advantages, disadvantages, the Government’s ability to maintain item, timeline for development and delivery, and Rough Order of Magnitude of cost per unit.  Interested companies should provide information along with technical questions regarding this announcement to Mr. Jan Owens, e-mail jan.owens@navy.mil.  Responses should be submitted no later than 10 January 2005.  Please include the RFI number (i.e., N00164-05-Q-0049) on all correspondence.  This notice does not constitute an Invitation for Bids or a Request for Proposal (RFP), and it is not a commitment by the Navy to procure products or services.  The Navy is only seeking information for future needs.  No RFP solicitation document exists at this time.  The Navy does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Request For Information, and will not reimburse any costs incurred by interested companies resp! onding to this announcement.  However, respondents to this Request for Information will not be excluded from consideration for contract participation in any potential follow-on hardware development activity.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT. Please read the entire synopsis.  The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Patuxent River, Maryland Material Management Support Department (AIR 3.5) is responsible for identifying an Automatic Identification Technology (AIT) solution to address the condition, location and accurate identification of aircraft engines, engine modules and the containers used to house these assets.  AIR 3.5 is seeking eligible small business firms capable of providing an AIT solution to accurately locate and continuously determine the status, location, and historical information of high value aircraft engine assets during handling, storage and transportation.  The AIT solution shall enable more effective inventory management, reduce losses due to inventory misplacement, enable condition monitoring to reduce damage to the engine assets during shipment and storage, and offers a positive readiness improvement and a reduction in operating and support costs.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this requirement is 334220 with a size standard of 750 employees.  The AIT solution shall be implemented in an open architecture.  A compact, low-power technology is desired with minimal infrastructure, low maintenance and easy to use programming and data entry.  Interoperability with other systems is also highly desirable. Proprietary solutions will be considered only if a government purpose license and design disclosure is made to enable the Navy to interface with other asset management systems.  The following KEY elements shall be included in the AIT solution and are listed in order of importance: 1) Total Asset Visibility – real-time locating capability for assets in-storage or in-transit is a key requirement to ensuring total asset visibility.  Position location is required to ascertain the rough geographic location of the container. The location of the container within the confines of a particular depot is highly desirable.  Proposed solutions that show that the container is within the depot but do not locate the container within the confines of a particular depot may be deemed unacceptable.  2) Item Identification – adequate memory storage for “license plate” data is key to ensuring the accuracy of visible items.  3) Condition – environmental sensors to monitor (at a minimum) humidity, temperature and pressure is required to ensure operational readiness of assets.  In addition to the key elements, the following characteristics are desired for the AIT solution:  1) Range – a minimum of 100 feet is required for any wireless transmission with a goal of 100 yards. 2) Operation – the beacon function should be capable of being user programmable (an emitting device cannot beacon with constant transmission and should have a capability to transmit only if queried). 3) Data Collection - user definable and at a minimum shall conform to DoD specified Unique Identification (UID) and/or Electronic Product Code (EPC) format. 4) Certifications – AIT devices shall be capable of being Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance (HERO) certified. 5) Frequency – use of Radio Frequency shall be Federal Communications Commission (FCC) compliant for CONUS and must meet equivalent international standards for overseas use. 6) Part Marking Readable – easy transfer of data and communication with existing DOD AIT media such as 2-D bar codes and Contact Memory Buttons (CMB) must be integrated for data accuracy and efficiency. 7) Read/Write Capability – through use of portable methods, AIT devices shall be read/write capable while the device is affixed to a container. 8) Battery Life – a 2-year minimum life shall be achieved.  Battery must be accessible from the outside of the container to eliminate the need to open a container in order to replace a battery.  Also, a low-voltage alarm must be transmitted to report low-battery power. 9) Sensor Expandable – additional ports shall be available for future requirements.  System as a whole shall be modular and upgradeable. 10) Portable Readers – shall be commercially available and interoperable. 11) Remote Monitoring Capability – asset visibility and monitoring shall be capable of accessing over the Internet. 12) Environmental Alarms – emails shall be generated to notify responsible personnel in the event that an environmental alarm is triggered. 13) Automatic Identification System (AIS) - must establish AIS to collect the data gathered from the AIT devices on the engines/containers.  At a minimum, it is required that data be furnished in an XML like transaction or be down loadable in a generic format (CSV, TXT, MS ACCESS etc).  It is the ultimate goal that data integrate directly with the current Aircraft Engine Management System (AEMS) or equivalent future Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. 14) Container Locating – capability to pinpoint a specific AIT device is required in the form of an audible or visible medium that can be triggered in close proximity to the container.  15) Operating Temperature – AIT devices must operate in the same environmental conditions experienced by engine/module containers ( -20°F to 120°F).  Requirements will include providing products to the following locations: NAVAIR, Patuxent River, MD and Naval Air Depot (NADEP), Jacksonville, FL.  The anticipated contract type will be firm-fixed price IDIQ with a period of performance of twelve (12) months.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI).  The U.S. Coast Guard is seeking sources that are capable of providing a customized Dive Trailer. The purpose of the Dive Trailer is to provide a single, transportable unit capable of fully supporting all aspects of the diving operations. The trailer must also serve as a self-contained Diving Locker for all operations. The following is a summary of the draft requirements:  The trailer should be designed to fit and be secured inside a C-130 aircraft and be towed by a Ford E-350 fifteen passenger van (maximum towing capacity of 9,000lbs; estimated cargo weight 4,000lbs). Maximum dimensions are 252 inches long by 104 inches wide by 96 inches high. All the equipment inside the trailer must be capable of being sufficiently stabilized and secured for air travel. Due to the inherently wet environment the trailer will be used in, all materials should be non-corrosive. Flooring should be durable and water resistant. The floor should have adequate anchor points to tie additional equipment down with standard cargo straps during transport.  Interior walls should be coated with vinyl or some other water resistant coating. The interior of the side door should be surfaced with a dry erase board as large as possible. A generator is needed to provide adequate interior and exterior lighting and a heating and air conditioning capability. The generator should be mounted externally to optimize internal capacity. Due to the wet environment the trailer will be used in, all electrical outlets must be protected by a ground-fault circuit interrupter (GFCI). Wherever possible (awning, stabilizer jacks, etc.) electric systems should be used instead of manual systems. An environmental control system is required to enable all weather operations and maintain a dry atmosphere in the trailer. The charging station requires sufficient electrical outlets to charge six devices. There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement. The request information does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of the submission of contractor’s information. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for proprietary information not properly identified. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations. Please submit information via email to Ms. Sabrina Severe at ssevere@comdt.uscg.mil and Ms. Jennifer Peterson at JPeterson@comdt.uscg.mil no later than 3:00 p.m. on December 17, 2004. Firms who wish to respond to this RIF should include their business size, CAGE code, Dun and Bradstreet number and GSA schedule should they hold one.

GEOGRAPHICAL AND PROGRAMMATIC CONTEXT

USAID/South Africa is one of the largest missions in sub-Saharan Africa.  Its 120 employees, organized into seven strategic objective teams and four support offices, manage a $600 million-plus portfolio of programs in democracy and governance, economic growth and employment, education and training, health, housing and urban environment, and a regional HIV/AIDS program.  South Africa, which plays a key political and economic role in Africa, is considered to be critical to U.S. foreign policy interests on the continent and attracts numerous VIP visits.  USAID programs are therefore subject to intense scrutiny by various elements of the U.S. government, by South African government ministries, and by diverse civil society constituencies.  Collocated with USAID/South Africa are the 15 employees of the Regional Inspector General Office/Pretoria and the Southern Africa Regional branches of the Offices of Foreign Disaster Assistance and Food for Peace.

For all PEPFAR-related activities, the incumbent takes the lead in directing the development, implementation, and close-out phases of USAID-financed contracts, grants and cooperative agreements, and in supporting, specifically, the bilateral and regional health strategic objective teams with developing/revising strategies, concept papers, and results packages.

    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of Public Law 107–296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

    (1)  The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held— 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107–296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships, which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled, as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. 
    (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296 of November 25, 2002.

    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of Public Law 107–296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

    (1)  The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity

    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.

    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled, as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. 
    (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296 of November 25, 2002.

Correctness of the Offer.  Caution--Offerors are hereby notified that all information provided in its oral presentation, written presentation documentation, including all resumes, must be accurate, truthful, and complete to the best of the Offeror's knowledge and belief.  The NRC will rely upon all representations made by the Offeror both in the evaluation process and for the performance of the work by the Offeror selected for award.  The NRC may require the offeror to substantiate the credentials, education, and employment history of its employees, subcontractor personnel, and consultants, through submission of copies of transcripts, diplomas, licenses, etc.  Part 1 - Written Presentation Documentation.  a.  The Offeror shall submit one (1) original and three (3) copies of its Written Presentation Documentation at the date and time specified for receipt of sealed offers.  The Offeror must address the topics listed in the section entitled, "TOPICS FOR ORAL PRESENTATIONS AND WRITTEN SUPPORTIVE DOCUMENTATION" in their Written Presentation Documentation.  The Written Presentation Documentation shall include printed copies of the overheads to be used during the Oral Presentation.

The Written Presentation Documentation is limited to 50 one-sided pages, including the resume’s, past performance surveys and oral presentation slides.  Offerors are cautioned that any documentation which exceeds the 50-page limitation will not be considered.  c.  The Written Presentation Documentation shall not discuss price or cost and fee. However, resource information, such as data concerning labor hours and categories, subcontracts, computer time, etc., must be included in the presentation material so that the Offeror's understanding of the scope of work may be evaluated.   Part 2 - Cost Proposal.  a.  The Offeror shall submit one (1) original and three (3) copies of the written Cost Proposal at the date and time specified for receipt of sealed offers.  The format and content of this documentation is described in the section entitled, COST PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS AND FORMAT.  II.  INSTRUCTIONS FOR ORAL PRESENTATIONS.  a.  The Offeror shall present solutions to fulfill the NRC's requirement via an Oral  Presentation which are to be documented in the Written Presentation Documentation.  The Oral Presentation shall highlight the main points of the Written Presentation Documentation.  Both the Oral Presentation and the Written Presentation Documentation combined shall present full and complete information to permit the NRC to make a thorough evaluation and a sound judgement that the proposed approach will have a reasonable likelihood of meeting the requirements and objectives of this procurement in accordance with the NRC's Statement of Work.  b. The Oral Presentation shall not discuss price or cost and fee. However, resource information, such as data concerning labor hours and categories, subcontracts, computer time, etc., must be included in the presentation material so that the Offeror's understanding of the scope of work may be evaluated.  c.  Immediately following the Oral Presentation, the Offeror must participate in an question and answer session conducted by NRC evaluation panel.  The purpose of the oral presentation and the question and answer session is to permit the NRC to evaluate the Offeror's knowledge and competence with regard to the NRC's requirements, objectives, challenges and risks.  d.   The Offeror's proposed Project team leaders (e.g., Program Manager) are requested to present the discussion on Corporate Experience and Past Performance.

The Offeror's oral presentation and answers provided during the question and answer session are not a part of its offer, may not include changes to its offer, and will not become a part of any resulting contract.  Neither the presentation nor the question and answer session constitute discussions within the meaning of FAR 15, and neither will it obligate the NRC to entertain revisions to the written presentation documentation.  The NRC intends to award without discussions.  Nevertheless, if the NRC determines that discussions and final proposal revisions will be necessary, the NRC will not discuss the oral presentation or the question and answer session and will not entertain revisions to the oral presentation or to the answers given to the source evaluation panel during the question and answer session.  f.

The NRC will award a contract to the offeror whose offer is technically acceptable and most advantageous to the Government, cost and other factors considered.  In other words, for an offeror to be selected for contract award, all requirements must be fully addressed to reflect whether an offeror has the ability to provide the services necessary in all areas identified in the Statement of Work and proposed costs must be realistic and reasonable.  The successful offer shall clearly demonstrate sufficient previous or current relevant work performed for other Federal agencies, the capability to deliver the services required and documented past performance information which clearly shows that the offeror has performed successfully on these previous or current relevant contracts.  In addition, the qualifications of all proposed key personnel, shall clearly demonstrate the necessary skills, knowledge, and experience in providing similar OD services to other Federal government agencies.

Waive informalities and minor irregularities in any offeror’s proposal. 4.  The NRC may award a contract on the basis of initial offer received, without discussions.  Therefore, each initial offer shall contain the offeror’s best terms relating to its costs and technical position.  The NRC will perform a separate cost analysis on each offeror’s cost proposal.  In order to provide a common base for evaluation of cost proposals, each offeror shall express the level of effort to provide the services as outlined in the statement of work in terms of staff hours and cost per staff hour for organizational development interventions.  In making the determination to award a contract to an offeror, the NRC will perform an analysis that takes into consideration the results of the technical evaluation and the cost analysis of each offeror.  EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD.  The NRC shall evaluate an offeror's proposal based on 1) Corporate Experience/Past Performance and 2) Key Personnel Qualifications and Experience.  The offeror must provide qualitative information addressing each evaluation criterion.  Failure to do so may result in an offeror's offer not being considered.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer the following technical question. Question: Section C.15 asked to design the air conditioner with temperature parameters, but does not give the heat load of the electronic equipment. Can you provide the BTU load. Response: The type, quantity, and usage of electronic equipment will vary with this requirement. Therefore, the BTU load cannot be determined. In addition to the requirements listed in the Statement of Work C.15.1, 3.5 to 4 ton units would meet our r equirements. This is the only technical question that was received prior to the deadline. The deadline for technical questions has passed. The response date remains no later than 3:00 PM MST, 16 December 2004.
