<DESC><p>NOTICE OF CONTRACT ACTION FOR NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT FOR Semiconductor-Tuned High Temperature Superconductor Filters for Ultrasensitive RF Receivers (SURF) Program. This is an announcement that the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) intends to award a Sole Source contract to Out of the Fog Research, LLC (OFR) to develop the required technology and build a prototype very-low-noise, ultra-fast tunable filter subsystem. OFR will fabricate a filter based on the use of decoupled cryogenic varactors and/or switches. The key element is the development of tunable filters that can be put in front of signals intelligence (SIGINT) or communication receivers, and even in the active elements of active electronically steerable arrays, with tuning speeds well below one millisecond. There is currently NO technology that is capable of the ultra-fast, yet low-loss notch or bandpass filter capability that is necessary to solve this operational problem. OFR LLC has prototyped novel RF circuit design in conjucntion with cryogenic technology to solve this multi-agency and military need. These technologies have been under development through DARPA's TASS program, the Navy's SPAWAR TST program, and SBIRs for the purpose maintaining a Continental United States (CONUS) High Temperature Superconductor (HTS) thin film capability (military critical technology) specifically to support government projects. Vendors who are capable of providing the services stated above shall fully identify their interest and submit, in writing, information documenting their qualifications and capabilities to meet the requirements stated above within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Responses must be submitted to Dawn M Ross, Contracting Officer, via email at dawn.ross@wpafb.af.mil. Responses received after 15 days or without the required information will be considered non-responsive to the synopsis, and will not be considered. Other business opportunities for the Air Force Research Laboratory are available at www.fedbizopps.gov. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Direct questions to the Contracting point of contact identified in the announcement.</p>

<DESC><p>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Pittsburgh, PA, hereby announces its intent to issue a purchase order to Lawrence Behr Associates for professional consulting services.
<p>The project consists of professional consulting services to identify and recommend for selection a commercial prefabricated structure to meet shielding requirements as determined.</p>
<p>The work consists of consulting services as requested to enable fabrication, delivery and installation of a prefabricated radio frequency shielded enclosure of approxiamately 250 sq. ft., with an 8 ft. ceiling and with radio frequency suppression of 100 dB @ 10 kHz - 10 GHz.</p>
<p>NIOSH has been assigned the task of researching underground mine communications under the Miner Act of 2006. In order to conduct this research, the Pittsburgh Research Laboratory requires a radio signal shielded laboratory in which they can design, calibrate, quantify, and document, receiver and transmitter characteristics under varying conditions. The frequencies of the devices under test will include everything from a few Hz up to many GHz. The shielded laboratory will isolate very sensitive receivers from the influence of all man made and environmentally generated electrical noise sources. Additionally, the shielded laboratory will contain any generated signals within the laboratory and hence minimize influence or disruption of radio based systems external to the laboratory. Not only is the design of the laboratory important but also the selection and evaluation of the area in which the laboratory is placed is extremely important. All facets of the design and placement of the laboratory must be done under the careful supervision of people skilled in the art. LBA (Lawrence Behr Associates) have the proper skills. They have the unique capability of supplying prefabricated and even custom designed shielded enclosures and also adapting space to be retrofitted with shielding.</p>
<p>This project is supported by justification for other than full and open competition to Lawrence Behr associates under authority of 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1). Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written capabilities statement and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward the capability statement and pricing information to Margaret L. Mooney, Reference 2009-Q-11036, CDC NIOSH, 626 Cochrans Mill Road, Pittsburgh, PA 15236-0070 or email to Mmooney@cdc.gov or FAX to (412)386-6843. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>The Government will review any/all capabilities statements and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response to this announcement will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with Lawrence Behr Associates, 3400 Tupper Drive, Greenville, NC 27834 as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this Pre-Solicitation Notice is to notify industry about an upcoming solicitation for The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Services (USCIS) Verification Division.  The USCIS Verification Division requires contractor assistance to plan and implement a national Marketing and Advertising Campaign (MAC).  The E-Verify Program was created by USCIS in response to the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-208) and the Basic Pilot Program Extension and Expansion Act of 2003 (P.L. 108-156).  E-Verify, a program of the US Department of Homeland Security and the Social Security Administration, provides US employers with a free automated system that verifies the work authorization status of new hires. In FY 2008, E-Verify received more than 6 million queries.  

The current primary objectives of MAC are to increase voluntary and responsible participation by all sectors of US employers, to educate employers and employees about the proper use of E-Verify and employee rights, and to promote the brand identity of E-Verify to the public.

The implementation approach will include the use of USCIS messaging, information and visuals, as well as new media developed by the contractor, to prepare for a multi-channel, multi-lingual media campaign that is capable of adapting as necessary to meet legislative and programmatic demands.  

Additional information about E-Verify may be obtained by visiting the USCIS website at:

http://www.DHS.GOV/E-VERIFY

Offerors may also call USCIS at 1(888) 464-4218 for general information on the program.

This procurement will be a 100% set a side for a competitive 8a acquisition in accordance with FAR 19.805.  This will be a time-and-materials contract for a base year, plus two one-year option periods. USCIS anticipates a national level marketing/advertising campaign budget estimated at $30,000,000.00.  Interested offerors must have demonstrated experience in managing campaigns of this size/scope.   Procedures in FAR Part 12 Commercial Items (Services), FAR Part 15 Contracting by Negotiation, and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) policies will be followed in selection of the successful offeror from the pool of eligible 8a firms that submit responsive proposals.  

USCIS anticipates having offerors use oral presentations (see FAR 15.102) in the metropolitan Washington, DC area to make their technical proposals.  The solicitation will be posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps.gov) website not sooner than 10 days after publication of this synopsis. 

This notice in not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract.

All questions concerning this competition must be directed in writing via email to the designated point of contact or by facsimile to 802-951-6455.  No questions or inquiries will be accepted by telephone.  The distribution of the resulting solicitation will be accomplished solely through the FedBizOpps website http://www.fbo.gov/.  Hard copies of the solicitation documents will not be available, therefore no written, telephone, or facsimile requests for the documents will be accepted.  The FedBizOpps site provides downloading instructions.  All future information about this acquisition, including the solicitation and any amendments, will be distributed solely through the FedBizOpps site.

<DESC>The US Department of Education anticipates the release of the 2009 Small Business Innovative Research Fast-Track Program solicitation on or about December 8, 2008.  A Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Fast-Track proposal is a single proposal that contains both Phase I and Phase II activities. Through the Fast-Track (Phase I & II) option, the Department of Education intends to fund proposals that have high potential for the commercialization of technologically innovative products that contribute to improved student learning and academic achievement in the field of education.  Participation is encouraged from firms with strong research or research and development (R/R&D) capabilities in the following priority areas:

Priority 1: Education Technology Products for Students
Priority 2: Education Technology Products for Teachers
Priority 3: Education Technology Products for School Administrators

By providing the opportunity to concurrently submit and review a proposal that contains both Phase I and Phase II activities, the Fast-Track option has the potential to minimize any funding gap between the Phase I and Phase II periods.  In order to apply for Fast-Track funding, offerors must submit a full Fast-Track proposal. A Fast-Track Technical Evaluation Review Panel will evaluate all eligible Fast-Track proposals. The Fast-Track proposal will receive a single rating for the proposed Phase I and Phase II project.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement to conduct a series of wind tunnel tests in a PolysonicWind Tunnel (PSWT) supporting the Ares 1 project.  The Ares I vehicle is part of NASA'smission to develop a cost-effective, next-generation space transportation system. TheAres I launch vehicle will be the manned portion of a series of vehicles that NASA isdesigning and developing as part of the Constellation program.	It will allow access tolow earth orbit in support of International Space Station functions as well as provideopportunities to explore beyond low earth orbit and explore deep space.  The launchsystem will, in keeping with the U.S. Space Exploration Policy, safely and reliably takehuman explorers to the Moon, Mars and on into the solar system.  The Ares I project ispreparing an aerodynamic database that characterizes the vehicle throughout the speedregime of ascent flight where aerodynamic effects are important. To support theassessment of the Ares I configuration, the Ares I project is responsible for developingaerodynamic databases over the ascent Mach range as well as for the descent phase of thefirst stage re-entry.  The project is currently designing and fabricating two 0.01-scale(~  38 long) wind tunnel models of Ares I DAC-3 (Design Analysis Cycle) configuration totest at NASA LaRCs Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel, for the Mach range 1.5-4.6 as well as a.015-scale first stage model.  In order to develop the databases for aboveconfigurations, the project requires integrated force and moment as well as distributedpressure data at the lower speeds for the initial phase of ascent, specifically in Machrange 0.5 to 1.6 for integrated forces and moments for ascent configuration, 0.5 to 5.0for descent first stage configuration, and 0.5 to 4.5 for distributed pressure data.  Theaerodynamic database will be used to determine the ARES I performance, stability &control effectiveness, and structural stability. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase theservices required to obtain this data from Boeing, Inc. who is the only known responsiblesource.  The Boeing Polysonic Wind Tunnel (PSWT) is the only blow-down wind tunnelfacility that simultaneously meets the Mach number range (0.5 to 5.0), Reynolds number(3.1 per ft. at a dynamic pressure of 2.36 psi), and physical characteristics (length ofthe tunnel test section) required to satisfy the Ares wind tunnel testing requirements The wind tunnel parameters identified are salient requirements that are necessary toobtain the integrated force, moment, and pressure data required to generate the Ares Iaerodynamic database and maintain acceptable dynamic pressures and loads on the models. In addition, the Ares 1 previous configurations were tested in the LaRC UPWT and theBoeing Polysonic Wind Tunnel to obtain the data to be used in developing the aerodynamicdatabases. Conducting the proposed tests in the same tunnel will eliminate data biasesspecific to a tunnel. Testing in another facility will compromise the validity andusefulness of the previous test data and increase risk to the program to an unacceptablelevel to maintain strict performance margins. Therefore only the Boeing PWST is capableof meeting the salient technical requirements and providing data that is compatible withthe previously obtained results.  The authority for this action is provided by FAR6-302-1, Only one responsible source, and FAR 13.5 Test Program for Certain CommercialItems (PL 104-106, Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 as amended by PL109-163, Section 1443 of the FY 2006 National Defense Authorization Act).  The Governmentintends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12 and Part 13.5, Test Program forCertain Commercial Items. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities andqualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact notlater than 4:30 p.m. local time on December 5, 2008. Such capabilities/qualificationswill be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct thisprocurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete thisproposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to thisnotice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are notacceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer whichshall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City (NSWC PCD) intends to award a sole source contract to Professional Solutions of Panama City Beach, FL.32407-4804 for the Safety Support Requirements for the Assault Breaching System Countermine System Program. This weapon system safety support requires the following expertise and experience from the Contractor:  (a) past experience supporting the ABS CMS safety program, including in depth knowledge and technical experience of existing ABS CMS weapon system safety analyses and documentation as well as unique system safety issues associated with the CMS weapon system, (b) familiarity and experience providing system safety support and developing weapon system safety documentation for the ABS CMS and similar US Navy weapons systems, and (c) significant experience developing successful data packages and presentations for the US Navy Weapon System Explosives Safety Review Board (WSESRB), Software System Safety Technical Review Pa! nel (SSSTRP), and US Air Force Non Nuclear Munitions Safety Review Board (NNMSBB), in support of US Navy weapon systems programs, (d) significant experience in developing US Navy mine weapon system assembly, training, and technical manuals. This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. IPS has the unique capabilities and knowledge required to support this effort.  No other vendor holds or maintains the technical expertise in the explosive safety program required to support this high priority safety program. Innovative Professional Solutions is a small business that has supported this effort the last two years. IPS has provided high quality weapon system safety support to the ABS CMS program previously on contracts N61331-07-P-3025 and N61331-06-P-2129. It is estimated that getting another source trained and up to speed on this tasking would increase the cost to the Navy by as much as 100%. Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activ! ity Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City Beach, FL 32407-7018. A firm-fixed-price order is anticipated.

<DESC>WebMethods Production and Staging Environment

The Air Force intends to award a brand name contract to World Wide Technology.  The purpose of this Sources Sought is to determine if there are any businesses available who are capable of performing the effort described herein.  Defense Automatic Addressing Systems Center (DAASC) at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is seeking sources to provide:
     Support in the continuing process to expand services for our customers, DAASC is operating a full-service EDI Telecommunications Hub and is maintaining and refining a Translation Engine for the any-to-any conversion of ANSI X12, MILS, and User-Defined Format (UDF) documents in any combination/direction.  With this capability, DAASC acts as an Electronic Business (EB) Gateway for the DoD and other Federal Civil Agencies, performing translation to/from formats specified by each of these customers.  Essentially, the DAASC is the facilitator that enables disparate systems to function homogenously.  This project focuses on the eventual replacement of the Global Exchange (GEX) GOTS software with the webMethods, highly available, secure hardware solution.   This will provide greater support to the warfighter by ensuring that critical applications are kept current with technology, available 24x7, 365 days per year and provides the best value to the government through transaction monitoring/processing technologies  Due to the essential mission that DAASC provides, the Department of Defense has defined the operation as Mission Assurance Category (MAC) I which identifies the DAASC processing as vital to the operational readiness or mission effectiveness of deployed and contingency forces in terms of both content and timeliness.  The consequences of loss of integrity or availability of a MAC I system are unacceptable and could include the immediate and sustained loss of mission effectiveness.

<DESC>Description: This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE; there is no solicitation available at this time.  No response will be provided to requests for a solicitation.  THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE IS PUBLISHED FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.

Background:  The mission of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency is to safeguard the United States and its allies from Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) (Chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and high-yield explosive, or CBRNE) by providing capabilities to reduce, eliminate and counter the threat and mitigate its effects.  This mission dictates a diverse set of customers and unique mission requirements.  The Nuclear Survivability Division (RD-NTS) would like to identify interested sources that will be capable of supporting the Veterans Advisory Board on Dose Reconstruction (VBDR) to perform its legislative mandate and ensure that requirements set forth in the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) and the Privacy Act of 1974 are fulfilled. The latest legislation was enacted on December 16, 2003, as the Veterans' Benefits Act of 2003 (Public Law 108-183, referred to below as the Act).  Following the recommendation of a National Academy of Sciences report published in 2003 on the Dose Reconstruction Program of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, this Act required the establishment of an independent Advisory Board to provide oversight of the dose reconstruction and claims settlement programs for veterans. 

The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) seeks potential sources for Veterans Advisory Board on Dose Reconstruction (VBDR) Support in the following capacities:
	(a) support the VBDR in conducting periodic, random audits of dose reconstruct-ions and decisions on claims for radiogenic diseases (specifically employ auditors who can complete this function in support of the VBDR),

	(c) provide all logistical support required for approximately one annual VBDR plenary meeting, and eight annual subcommittee meetings, to include preparation of any applicable Federal Register issued documents; arranging locations and accommodations for meetings; making travel reservations per Government Joint Travel Regulations; providing/arranging for clerical, audio-visual, and transcription services
	(d) travel to meetings and conferences in support of the VBDR
	(e) complete all required federal training (e.g. Privacy Act, Information Assurance, and FACA) to fully support VBDR, and
	(f) support the VBDR in carrying out such other activities with respect to the review and oversight of the Dose Reconstruction Program as the Secretaries of Defense and Veterans Affairs shall jointly specify.
	(g) prepare and submit quarterly reports, 
	(h) maintain the VBDR website:  http://www.vbdr.org/
	(i) maintain and secure all VBDR records - approximately 16.4 linear feet of hardcopy records (or 15.3 ft3) and 2.1 GB of electronic records,
	(j) establish contact with key organizations, individuals, and national scientific committees representing veteran, public, and governmental interests and advocacies to identify potential candidates to serve on an external review and oversight group. Conduct the necessary interviews and collect resumes of potential candidates for review by DTRA and/or VA, including independent recommendations for consideration, and
	(k) maintain VBDR records and conduct VBDR business in accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act , Privacy Act of 1974, and as directed by the Contracting Officers technical representative (COR).
	(l) Contractor facility shall be located within the Washington, DC area,
	(m) office space for use by the VBDR chairperson, during normal working hours, with access to restrooms and parking within reasonable distances.  This office will include a desk, chairs, shelves, telephone, and one computer system with email, internet access, and Microsoft office software,

STATMENT OF WORK: 

The Contractor shall furnish all managerial, supervisory, direct and overhead personnel; equipment, supplies; and other items or services; except specified herein as Government-furnished, to provide Wireless Management Services.

The FDA provides staff members various wireless means of communication (i.e. BlackBerrys, Cell Phones, Air Cards, etc).  There is no centralized management of these devices as currently these are managed by centers, various offices and other decentralized means.  The Office of Information Management (OIM) would like to centralize all the functions to manage these wireless services into one functional area, and managed by one primary office.  Estimate amount of devices to manage is 4,500 each and at approximate 8 different locations in the continental United States.
The primary objectives are to: (1) Establish a centrally managed procurement vehicle through which FDA may procure wireless services; (2) Lower the total costs associated with wireless services while maintaining industry standard service levels; and (3) Utilize business intelligence to better support overall decision making and performance management related to the use and support of wireless telecommunication services and devices.
FDA assigns an intentionally broad definition to the term total cost.  Included in that cost definition are not only the direct costs of the wireless device (e.g. cell phone, Smartphone, blackberry, cellular air card etc) and the ongoing telecommunications service charges, but also an agencys internal costs to order and purchase, distribute, initialize for use (e.g. initialize and load application or security software), provide user support, manage invoices, make payments, and eventually arrange for final disposition and disposal of the device.
An additional objective of this procurement is to ensure well-qualified wireless service providers that have the expertise and demonstrated capability to provide services to FDA and to strategically leverage that pool of wireless service providers in ways that lower the total cost of ownership for wireless service and devices.   

The contractor shall provide the FDA a full range of wireless services that will assist in not only the management of the wireless services and devices, but reduce the total wireless costs.  
Program/Project Management Services
The Contractor shall provide program and project management services for this  contract.  For the purposes of this contract, Program management includes those services and activities required to coordinate resources and provide management and performance reporting across one or more task orders.  Project management includes management services necessary to coordinate resources and ensure performance and service delivery for a particular task order.  Both program and project management services are assumed by the Government to be integral and inherent in the performance of all service tasks of this contract.  
Program Management provider is expected to:  
	Manage, track, and coordinate the activity of all of its resources, partners and subcontractors needed to fulfill the requirements of this contract and to ensure successful and on-time delivery of all task order services and deliverables.
	Meet with Project Officer (PO)/Contracting Officers Representative (COR) or designated Government representative at contract and program initiation to jointly review program management tasks, roles, responsibilities, and the program management reporting requirements.
	Develop a Program Management Plan outlining their approach to performing program and cross-project coordination tasks required to meet the requirements of this contract.  The Program Management Plan should also include a description for how and when common performance measures from individual task orders will be collected and reported as well as how any performance problem trends and disputes involving multiple task orders or projects are to be addressed for resolution. 
	The Program Management Plan shall be delivered no later than fifteen (15) days after contract award.  Updates to the plan shall be delivered as requested. 
	Support quarterly management meetings with the Project Officers, CORs, COTRs or designated government representative to address and deal with service contract related issues and to discuss progress on key Program-level performance measures.
	Provide quarterly Program Performance Status Reports (PSR) in accordance with deliverable table summarizing progress and towards achieving key program management goals and performance against the Program-level performance measures. The PSR should include and report the following information compiled at the program level:

1. Number of wireless service lines managed under this contract
2.  Number of dollars spent on wireless management services
3. Number of minutes and kilobytes (KB) used (as it relates to flat rate usage)
4. Savings generated or attributable to services

Each of the 4 above items should include a total as well as a detailed breakout of the total by month, by agency, by service type, and by service carrier.    


Project Management provider is expected to:  
Manage, track, and coordinate the activity of all internal provider resources as well as those of any partners and subcontractors used to successfully fulfill the requirements of the individual task order.

	Meet with the Project Officers, CORs, COTRs or designated government representative at task order and project initiation to jointly review project management tasks, work assignments, roles, responsibilities, and the contactors schedule for startup and/or any project transition activities.
	Develop a Project Management Plan (PMP) outlining the approach to be used to coordinate and control the performance of all service tasks required by the contract task order.  The PMP should also include an overall project schedule plan.  A PMP shall be delivered to the ordering agency no later than fifteen (15) days after task order award.  Updates to the PMP shall be delivered by the contractor to the Project Officers, CORs, COTRs or designated government representative as requested.

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice

This is a sources sought notice published for market research purposes only.  Anticipated NAICS code is 237990.  The Forest Service is conducting market research on a possible requirement for stream restoration work on Daves Creek located on the Kenai Peninsula, in Alaska.  The schedule of items and statement of work provide a listing of the type of equipment that may be needed for this project along with a brief description of the project.  The magnitude of construction is estimated to be between $500,000 and $1,000,000.  Funds are not currently available or obligated for this project but are expected in fiscal year 2009 and 2010.  If you are interested in this project, please provide the following information concerning the status of your company:

Company Name and Address:
DUNS Number:  ___________________________
Company Size status:  Large or Small business. NAICS code: 237990. Annual receipts:  $33.5 million.
SBA 8(a) contractor?  Yes or No
Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business? Yes or  No
Eligible and registered in CCR as a Hub Zone Contractor? Yes or No.  Information pertaining to HubZone qualifications can be obtained at:  http://www/sba.gov/hubzone.  Eligible HubZone contractors who are not registered in CCR can register at http://www.ccr.gov/. 
Provide a brief summary of companys experience with projects of a similar nature.

This project will address the first -mile of Daves Creek downstream of the Tern Lake outlet.  Over the course of the two (2) year project, the following tasks will be accomplished:

Restore the stream channel, floodplain, and streamside vegetation within a 2,000-foot long segment of Daves Creek downstream of the Tern Lake outlet to improve fish and wildlife habitat, stream channel condition, and water quality.  
Construct approximately 400 feet of accessible trail in the immediate vicinity of the Tern Lake Day Use Area.
Project details:  A 2,000-foot long impaired section of Daves Creek, just downstream of the Tern Lake outlet, will be restored over a two (2) year period.  The aquatic habitat and riparian conditions in Daves Creek are poor as a result of historic road construction and other past activities that have manipulated the stream channel.  This project will move a portion of the existing channel away from the Sterling Highway to create a new, more sinuous channel designed to mimic natural conditions.  Other portions of the existing channel within the project area would be modified or enhanced in place.  

Stream restoration work will modify/construct the stream channel to include pool-riffle sequences, engineered logjams, side channels, and instream log/rock structures where applicable.  New segments of the channel will be constructed in the dry wherever possible to minimize water quality disturbances, and water will be routed into these new channels after they are constructed to specifications and grade.  Because the existing channel is severely entrenched, a new floodplain will have to be created adjacent to the restored channel, requiring considerable earth moving.  Portions of the old channel will be filled in to create additional floodplain.  The restoration contract will include final grading, but not re-vegetation.  Re-vegetation of the riparian areas and floodplains will be conducted by the Forest Service in following years.

Equipment will likely include 1 or 2 excavators, 1 or 2 D-5 to D-8 bulldozers, 1 rock truck, and 1 tree skidder.  Stream restoration materials, including whole trees, boulders, and gravel, will be taken from the project area, adjacent areas, and off-site sources within 10 miles of the project area.  Approximately 0.4 miles of temporary access roads will be created and reclaimed after project completion.  The restored stream channel, floodplain, and riparian area will cover up to 9 acres.  

Approximately 400 feet of trails will be constructed within the project area to replace existing user trails along the banks of Tern Lake and Daves Creek.  These trails will be constructed to meet accessibility standards and will be constructed further from the banks than the existing trails in order to protect the banks and riparian vegetation.

The State of Alaska requires that all in-stream restoration work is conducted between May 15 and July 15 to protect anadromous fish.  It is anticipated that completion of all of the stream restoration work for this project will require between two (2) and four (4) months of heavy equipment construction work.  It is anticipated that at least half of the stream restoration work will be completed between May 15, 2009 and July 15, 2009, with the remainder completed between May 15, 2010 and July 15, 2010.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration, Office of Acquisition and Grants (OAG, in conjunction with its customer, the Office of Telecommunications and Systems Operations (OTSO), is currently performing market research to determine the availability of printers capable of printing Social Security Number (SSN) cards to replace its two IBM 6262 impact printers.  SSA is seeking information from interested sources regarding the availability of printer technologies or printers capable of printing SSN cards utilizing its current card mailer substrate with minimal or no programmatic changes required as workarounds for the printer band-controls.  In addition to information regarding the printer, SSA requests details regarding availability, security, maintainability, stability, and the capacity to accommodate two percent growth annually.  

Synopsis Terms and Conditions: 

 This is a sources sought announcement, a market survey for written information only.  
 This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and the Government will not award a contract from this announcement. 
 The Government will not reimburse for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests. 
 The Government will not accept any telephone calls requesting a bid package or solicitation.  There is no bid package or solicitation. 
 In order to protect the procurement integrity of any future procurement, if any, that may arise from this announcement; the Government will not give information regarding the technical point of contact.
 The Government will not make appointments for presentations.  This synopsis is for planning purposes only, not a commitment by the Government.  
 The Government will use responses to this sources sought/market research notice to make appropriate acquisition decisions.  

As part of a past procurement, SSA tested a printer using Flash Fusion technology that was unsuccessful in maintaining the security of the printed character.  SSA conducted a secure printer replacement study to develop alternative solutions to the current SSN card print environment.  Potential options for replacements identified in the study are UV Cured Inkjet print technologies or technologies that involve physical absorption of the ink by the paper fibers.  

SSA currently prints an average of 80,000 SSN cards per day.  The size of the SSN card is 4 inches by 8 inches, and SSA prints in the 1-up format on 90-pound paper.  When printing two SSN cards, SSA uses 8 inches by 9 inches.  The 9-inch dimension currently contains tractor feeds that SSA removes during the insertion process.  In the future SSA will change this fan fold to roll stock.  The solution must be field modifiable from fan fold to roll paper stock.

Due to the security of the Social Security Card, SSA cannot provide SSN Card samples to the Vendor.  

The printing requirements of SSA are:  

 SSA is not looking for a multiple printer solution.  However, SSA is considering the potential for a backup printer.
 Each printer must be capable of printing up to 120,000 SSN cards per 8 hour shift.  
 The print operator needs to be able to start, stop, and restart print jobs as well as control priorities and print order.   
 The solution must be capable of printing on pin-fed stock and be adaptable to accept roll feed with two-up or three-up stock. 
 The solution must be capable of printing on the current stock (pre-printed, 90 pound banknote stock).  
 Due to a proprietary character set, the printing solution must be compatible of receiving an AFP IPDS data stream.
 If the print solution is not native IPDS, then SSA would prefer internal protocol conversion as compared to an external device.
 The printed character on the SSN card substrate must be recognizable by OCR readers within the current SSA Track and Trace system.
 The printed character must pass distinctive performance testing in additional to the standard industry tests.  Testing will include at a minimum extensive scratch and lift testing, as-well-as chemical spot testing.
 Printers must cease printing upon error and must indicate the problem by displaying a visible malfunction indicator or message upon the printer.  
 The recommended solution should consider hardware redundancy. 
 Printers must have a visual display showing error messages and/or error codes.
 Power requirement: SSA anticipates implementation of printers in the National Computer Center (NCC) located in Baltimore, MD.  The electrical distribution infrastructure of the NCC is 480V:208V/120V. These are delta/wye configuration transformers. All three voltages are available in UPS or house power supplies. However, SSA prefers to avoid 120V configurations for this solution unless it is for peripheral support equipment.  3-phase power is available and recommended for solutions exceeding 30A.
 The solution must include all hookups necessary to interface with the SSA IPv4 10/100 Ethernet network via an RJ45 connector.
 The solution must be IPv6 compliant or a planned implementation of IPv6 must be established.
 Only new equipment is acceptable.
 Must provide one year of consumables (i.e., Ink, cleaning materials, and any miscellaneous items required by the solution)
 Installation services will be included with the delivery of the printers and shall include unpacking and initial set-up (configuration services).  
 The solution must include an Output Stacker tray.
 The contractor shall provide on-call, on-site maintenance for all hardware supplied for a period of 90 days following the delivery of each printer (warranty period). 
 Optional:  a soundproof cabinet or encasement.

<DESC><p>15th Contracting Squadron, Hickam AFB, Hawaii is seeking interest of potential and eligible contractors for an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Design/Build Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) at Hickam AFB, Hawaii and other Air Force Installations throughout the Hawaiian Islands. Sources Sought responses are due no later than 8 December 2008. The MACC is a contract for execution of a broad range of maintenance, repair and minor construction and may include design. Work to be performed under the MACC will be within the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes as follows: Sector 23, Construction, Subsection 233, Building Development and General Contracting, size standard $33.5 million (except dredging and surface cleanup activities; Subsector 234, Heavy Construction, size standard $33.5 million and Subsector 235, Special Trade Contractors, size standard $14 million. Contractors will be expected to accomplish a wide variety of individual construction tasks, including design/build, renovation, and additions/upgrades, along with specific work in heating/ventilation / Air Conditioning, electrical, mechanical and other major trades.<br />Description of work will be identified in each individual task order. Anticipated individual task orders may range from $2,500 - $5,000,000. The program value is still under consideration, but at this time, the program is expected not-to-exceed $60,000,000 over the five-year period. Each contract awarded will contain a basic 12-month period with four 12-month option periods. The number of awards the government will award is still under consideration, however at this point the government anticipates awarding four (4)or five (5) contracts. The government will evaluate offers and select the awardees utilizing the best value source selection procedures descried in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR Part 15.3) and the Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS 5315.3). In using this best value approach, the government seeks to award to those offerors who give the Air Force the greatest confidence they will best meet our requirements. While government source selection evaluation team and the source selection authority will strive for maximum objectivity, the source selection process, by its nature, is subjective. This may result in an award being made to higher rated, higher priced offerors where the decision is consistent with the evaluation factors in the RFP and the selection authority reasonably determines that the technical superiority, and/or overall business approach, and/or superior past performance, of higher priced offerors outweighs the cost difference. THE RFP may identify a seed project, which will be awarded to the highest rated offeror for the first award. All other successful awardees are guaranteed a minimum of $2,500. The Government will compete future individual requirements among the awardees.<br />This acquisition is being considered for Section 8(a) set-aside, HUBZone set-aside, unrestricted competition, or a combination of these.<br />In responding to this sources sought synopsis, please indicate your (a) interest as a prime contractor, teaming partner, joint venture, primary subcontractor and indicate (b) if your business is 8(a) and/or HUBZone certified, large, or small, (c) provide evidence of recent (within three (3) years), relevant (multiple trade, multiple task order) experience in work similar in type and scope to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, and points of contact with telephone numbers and a statement as to why the project is relevant, and (d) availability of bonding of a least $10,000,000 (minimum anticipated for each performance period) for this contract. Please provide your responses to SSgt Daniel Chang, Contract Specialist at 448-2925 or Daniel.Chang@hickam.af.mil. An actual solicitation is expected to be issued March 2009.<br />The closing date and time for submission of offers will be contained in the solicitation package. The entire solicitation, including the specifications and drawings, will be made available only on the Electronic Posting System (EPS) Web site at http://www.eps.gov at that time. Potential offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation package and any other pertinent information and for downloading their own copy of the solicitation package. Potential offerors MUST register at www.eps.gov in order to receive notification and/or changes to the solicitation. All contractors MUST register in the Central Contractor Registration database or their proposal will not be considered. Contractors can obtain further information on the Central Contractor registration (CCR) at web site http://www/ccr/gov. Prospective offerors who would like their company name included on the Bidder's Mailing List (plan holder's list) may do so on the FEDBIZOPPS website under IVL (Interested Vendor's List). This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or multiple contracts nor does it obligate the Government to pay for any bid/proposal preparation costs. For further opportunities, you may review AF needs at http://www.selltoairforce.org. For other opportunities and information go to the small business administration web site at http://www.sba.gov or contact our Small Business Specialist, James Watanabe@hickam.af.mil.

<DESC>This is strictly a special notice that is being published so as to reach a wider audience. It is not a federal procurement action. NO SOLICITATION IS OR WILL BE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS NOTICE.

Announcement of Scheduled Tests

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is pleased to announce a series of tests for evaluating the effectiveness of extended feature sets in latent fingerprint searches.  By extended features is meant fingerprint image characteristics beyond those traditionally used by human experts and/or AFIS systems. The goals are to quantify the performance achievable by supplementing traditional features with extended features" and thereby guide future standardization thereof.

The plan envisions a kickoff workshop, an open challenge problem, a second workshop, and a formal test of participant-provided latent identification implementations (submitted as SDKs). The first workshop, planned for the February 2009 timeframe, will consist of two parts: 1) a discussion of the NIST's results of their (now concluding) Evaluation of Latent Fingerprint Technology (ELFT) Phase II testing; and 2) a discussion of extended feature sets, including presentations and discussions of the goals of this project, as well as the subsequent open book challenge to evaluate the features specified in the CDEFFS (Committee to Define an Extended Fingerprint Feature Set)  document.  

The extended feature evaluation is sponsored by the FBI. NIST will coordinate this project closely with the FBI. Staff from NIST and Noblis, Inc. will administer the tests. The CDEFFS document is available at: http://fingerprint.nist.gov/standard/cdeffs   

Who Should Participate?

Participants in ELFT -EFS should plan to attend the workshop.  Vendors of AFIS systems and academic institutions with a latent fingerprint search capability are strongly encouraged to participate in ELFT-EFS. Comments are welcomed from all sectors of the latent community.  

How to Participate

Detailed information may be obtained from the following websites:

http://fingerprint.nist.gov/latent/ELFT-EFS

NIST welcomes all comments. We are particularly interested in timely feedback on participation in the workshop.

To register as an interested party, please send name, affiliation, email, and telephone. Communications should be addressed to: latent-efs@nist.gov

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate a sole source contract for contractor programming, database, and scientific support services to Alexander Kramida, 18723 Purple Martin Lane, Gaithersburg, MD 20879-1749, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1).  The NIST Data Center on Atomic Spectroscopy requires contractor programming, database, and scientific support services for the unification of the HTML bibliographic references of both the NIST Atomic Spectra Database (ASD) v.3 and the NIST Atomic Energy Levels and Transition Probabilities Bibliography Databases (BDs) and for the critical compilation of Atomic Energy Levels and Spectral Lines for the period 1990 through 2003. NIST is aware of no other vendor besides Alexander Kramida that can unify these systems, which is used continually by NIST staff and researchers worldwide.  

The sole source determination is based on the need that the existing database and programming code is proprietary and can only be obtained from Alexander Kramida.  This order is a follow on to NIST purchase order SB1341-08-SE-0352, which was competed and awarded to Alexander Kramida for contractor programming and database support services for the unification of the NIST Atomic Spectra Database (ASD) v.3 and the NIST Atomic Energy Levels and Transition Probabilities Bibliography Databases (BDs).  Alexander Kramida was the only offeror to respond to the original solicitation.

Alexander Kramida appears to be uniquely qualified to fulfill this requirement for he has unique scientific knowledge and experience in performing the tasks required.  In addition, Alexander Kramida is the proprietary owner of the Level Optimization (LOPT) Code and the database software code that will be utilized to augment the NIST Bibliography Database on Energy Levels and Spectra as required. NIST intends to award a firm-fixed-price purchase order for a period of one year.  Interested parties may identify their capability; however, they must clearly and unambiguously demonstrate their ability to perform the requirement in writing, no later than the response date in order to be considered. This notice of intent is not a solicitation. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether competitive procedures may be used by the Government.  Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing via email to Janine Kerns, Contract Specialist, at janine.kerns@nist.gov.  No telephone requests will be honored.

1.0 DESCRIPTION

The Time Recorded Ubiquitous Sensor Technologies (TRUST) project was initiated by the Department of Homeland Securitys (DHS) Science & Technology (S&T) Directorate to solicit innovative solutions to detect and provide alert to the presence of dangerous cargo (Note 1) in maritime shipping containers (Note 2) during their transit to U.S. ports.

The TRUST project is seeking GAME-CHANGING technologies that offer break-through potential and that may be disruptive to the traditional manner in which technology development occurs (Note 3). Accordingly, DHS S&T is willing to accept moderate to high technology development risk if a research effort promises a high payoff (Note 4). 

The TRUST project is distinct from the Safe Container (SAFECON) project initiated by the Department of Homeland Securitys (DHS) Science & Technology (S&T) Directorate in February 2007 with the issuance of Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) and a subsequent Request for Information (RFI).  Although both projects seek to detect dangerous cargo, the technical breakthrough sought through the SAFECON project focuses on the short dwell-time goal whereas TRUST project goals are to detect the presence of dangerous cargo while the container transits from the port of origin to its U.S. port of destination, assumed to be a minimum of 5 days.  TRUST also allows system components to be mounted on or internal to the container.  

Specifically, the TRUST projects goals are to identify and demonstrate innovative technologies that have the following attributes: 

*	detect and identify dangerous cargo (Note 1) contained within a maritime shipping container without opening the container;
*	system components mount on or internal to the container without requiring physical interferences with lifting/loading operations;
*	capable of alerting a positive detection during transit (between the time the container is closed and sealed and before entering a U.S. port (assumed to be a minimum of 5 days);
*	operate without impacting the normal flow of legitimate commerce;
*	capable of properly operating in the maritime shipboard environment 
*	capable of communicating through a physical interface such as the Marine Asset Tag Tracking System (MATTS);
*	comply with all labor, health, safety, and other applicable regulations.

Note 1: For the purpose of the TRUST project, dangerous cargo is defined as chemical and biological agents, radiological and nuclear materials, explosives, and living human (people) cargo (CBRNE & P). 

Note 2: The term maritime shipping container implies the 20 and 40 ISO 668 (1995) dry box container, which is used in intermodal transport. The terms shipping container and container are used interchangeably.

Note 3: The term disruptive technology refers to technology that is ripe for immediate and dramatic capability development. This type of leap ahead capability development typically does not follow an evolutionary or spiral development path. Rather, progress usually depends on an ability to think out-of-the-box, i.e. create a technology solution or apply an existing one in a new and innovative way.  

Note 4: The TRUST project is designated by DHS S&T as a Homeland Innovative Prototypical Solutions (HIPS). HIPS are disruptive technologies because of high risk or radical departure from established requirements and concepts of operation. HIPS projects invest in S&T projects intended to achieve a level of maturity suitable for transition to an acquisition program within four to eight years. HIPS make significant investment in projects with high technological risks but that offer the prospect, if successful, of being revolutionary game changers in DHS component capabilities.

2.0 PURPOSE OF THIS RFI 

Through this RFI, DHS S&T is seeking responses to determine the capability of the market to provide innovative technologies that may meet TRUST project goals. 
A workshop will be held December 11, 2008 at a location to be announced for both government and industry representatives interested in cargo container security research and product development to discuss:
	The challenges associated with detecting and alerting CBRNE & P from inside cargo shipping containers  needs and requirements.
	DHS program activities to develop and test detection and alert system architectures and sensors within cargo shipping containers.
	DHS International partners perspective.
	Results and lessons learned from a first-generation systems and architectures currently employed.
	Anticipated performance, cost, installation, operation, and maintenance of new sensor(s) and concepts will be explored.
	System integration concepts.
	How to participate in this DHS S&T prototype development, test, and evaluation activity.

The workshop will be structured to encourage dialogue between the government and industry.  Participants will have the opportunity to provide input to DHS on CBRNE & P detection and alert architectures, systems, and integrated concepts that would alert authorities to the presence of threat materials and humans inside containers while in transit.  Participants will also have an opportunity to schedule individual meetings with DHS representatives on the day of and the day following the workshop to discuss specific concepts. 

Specifics regarding the workshop and scheduling individual meetings will be posted to the www.fbo.gov website as an amendment to this RFI.

<a href="mailto:karen.mckevitt@us.army.mil">US Army C-E LCMC Acquisition Center - DAAB07</a>
<DESC>DRAFT STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES (SOO) FOR SERVICES IN SUPPORT OF THE NETWORK SERVICE CENTER (NSC)<BR><BR>25 Nov 2008<BR><BR>1.0  INTRODUCTION<BR><BR>1.1	PURPOSE - The Government is in the process of preparing a competitive solicitation for the acquisition of Area Processing Center (APC) services in support of the Armys Network Service Center (NSC).   This acquisition will include: Non-Secure Internet Protocol Router (NIPR) Services as well as Secure Internet Protocol Router (SIPR) services, Installation Processing Node (IPN) implementation, and upgrades to Theater Network Operations and Security Centers (TNOSCs).  This acquisition will not include Regional Hub Nodes (RHNs).  This Draft SOO is the first step by the Government in an iterative process to provide information to industry.  The objective of this interim release is to provide advance notice to Industry of Armys intent to release a Draft RFP.  The resultant draft RFP will competitively solicit and award a contract for NSC services and will be released on or about 05 Jan 2009.  Requirements will include:<BR><BR>	Product descriptions and a Performance Work Statement (PWS) will allow companies to offer their services in consonance with commercial practices <BR>	Options for implementation may include (but are not limited to):<BR>"	Government Owned Contractor Operated (GOCO)<BR>"	Contractor Owned Contractor Operated (COCO)<BR>"	Contractor Owned Government Operated (COGO)<BR>"	Contractor Partnership with Defense Information Services Agency (DISA)<BR><BR>1.2	BACKGROUND -- The NSC construct is an evolving integrated services capability that is comprised of connectivity through various communications capabilities (ie commercial and government networks), Operational Management (NETOPS) and Data Processing Services (i.e., storage on demand, computational server support and Application hosting and delivery).  The NSC will enable the war-fighting functions by providing a seamless, responsive, integrated, user-focused Army enterprise network that delivers mission critical information capabilities to the Operational Army and the Generating Force through all phases of joint operations. These will be Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) technology information and communications systems.  Service Level Agreements (SLA) will be specified in the future for defining Threshold and Objective requirements. <BR><BR>1.2.1  Area Processing Center (APC) -- The APC is a new construct under which area, regional, and enterprise services are delivered by a limited number of centrally managed facilities in a standardized manner. An APC is a concentration point for installation interconnectivity, a location for common servers and enterprise services, and an entry point into the Army enterprise through an enhanced security gateway. APCs provide security management to permit network interfaces to a variety of networks and to permit connections to public, inter-agency, coalition, and joint organizations. APCs also host functional applications for use by Operational Army and ARFORGEN.<BR><BR>1.2.2    Required Services and SLAs: SLAs are being developed for all services defined in sub-paragraphs 1.2.2.1-1.2.2.9.<BR><BR>1.2.2.1  Application Hosting and Computer Process Services --Application Hosting provides the capability to provide a standard environment for applications. The environment can be provided at the enterprise level at an Area Processing Center (APC), or at an installation or a tactical sanctuary location at an Installation Processing Node (IPN). <BR><BR>1.2.2.2  Application, Data, and User Migration Strategies -- Services will be required to migrate users accounts, applications, files from a post/camp/ station to a centralized location in accordance with a seamless and secure strategy.  The contractor will be prepared to place emphasis on migrating user accounts, services and applications involved with Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC).<BR><BR>1.2.2.3  Secured Server Infrastructure -- Provides the processing infrastructure required by applications and functional application enclaves at the APCs and IPNs in addition to the equipment  to connect and secure the core network at each location which provides the means to ensure and control access to applications and application enclaves.  This includes the means to support an out-of-band management service for the infrastructure, thin-client access to ensure secured and controlled access to applications from unsecured locations and platforms.  It also includes a means to create enclaves for various security contexts including the means to give access to specified enclaves to support joint, coalition, inter-agency and Non-Government Organization (NGO) access.<BR><BR>1.2.2.4	 Server and Applications Management -- Provides the processes and technologies to install and recover applications at APCs, functional application enclaves, and IPNs, as required to support the mission commanders operational concept; the means to secure processing assets in accordance with evolving Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) requirements; and the means to maintain a secure and standard configuration for each asset. This capability will use a standard organization construct, standard technical processes, and standard management tools across  locations.<BR><BR>1.2.2.5  Enterprise Directory Services and Identity Management- provides the means to authenticate the identity of users, access to enterprise identity sources such as DoD<BR>Global Directory Service, Army Enterprise Directory Service, and Army Active Directory implementations. The application owners will provide the means to determine the authorization to access and allow roles based on the enterprise data defining the identity and relative information concerning the individual or system accessing the application.<BR><BR>1.2.2.6  Network Management and Operations  A single global enterprise service support capability will assign and track actions taken to provision Information Technology (IT) services to the supported organizations and missions; report and track resolution of the incidents and problems related to availability and performance of the IT services provided; and serve as the authoritative source of the assets and status of the IT assets provided to support mission. The Army enterprise will use this capability to direct and monitor their efforts to provide proactive support to the operating and generating forces. The ability to do this will derive from the capability to access and integrate the information concerning resources globally and the processes to provide support across theater boundaries. Each organizational element of the enterprise LandWarNet(LWN) Theater will operate identically and provide consistent service agreement choices. Enterprise Service Support provides the means to align operational process within and across NSCs globally. This capability allows each theater based NSC to operate using the same NetOps processes to provision services to Operating Forces and Generating Forces throughout all phases. By collecting, storing, and relating data regarding services, assets, contact information, incidents, problems, etc. (i.e., all interactions), the user will be viewed in the same manner from within or across NSCs. The use of a global enterprise service support system is a key capability to addressing these issues. A global enterprise service support capability provides several facilities to align NSC operations to include:<BR>" Embedded best business practices (from a common incident and problem resolution database)<BR>" Single enterprise repository (maintaining global IT asset information).<BR>" Enterprise service desk (providing a common set of work flows and standards of performance to execute service actions)<BR><BR>1.2.2.7 Storage Services - Protected Storage Management provides common enterprise storage services at APCs, functional application enclaves, and IPNs, using Storage Fabric services, data-encryption services, storage switching, data replication, and data archiving capabilities. This service shall be separate from the processing infrastructure to ensure the means to enable, secure, and control access to data. <BR><BR>1.2.2.8 Continuity of Operations - The capability to replicate data, restore data and restore applications, all on alternative IT resources, as required, to provide the applications and information necessary to support prioritized mission requirements under a variety of threat scenarios. The ability to allocate resources from the NetOps capacity management capability to affect Continuity Of Operations Plan (COOP) capabilities consistent with a mission commanders concept of operation.<BR><BR>1.2.2.9	Information Assurance (IA) Services- These services ensure information availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and non-repudiation. This includes providing for restoration of information systems by incorporating protection, detection, prevention, and reaction capabilities. These services should be interoperable with current and future LWN systems.<BR><BR>2.0	SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES<BR><BR>2.1	SCOPE  - The Governments objective is to award a contract to provide services as identified in section 1.2.2 above, for applications hosting, storage on demand, servers on demand and other enterprise services.  The contractor will perform all necessary engineering, production, test, fielding, training, and support.  The NSC contract will have a basic award effort and yearly options.  Options may include: E-mail/ Blackberry, Connectivity, Active Directory, Collaboration, Storage, Archiving, Unified Communications, User Migration, Identity Management, Installation Interfaces/Perimeter Security and Enterprise Fly-Away Support Teams to migrate users.<BR><BR>2.2	PROGRAM MANAGEMENT - The Governments primary management objectives are three-fold.  First, allow the contractor maximum flexibility to utilize strategies that leverage industry best practices, and as appropriate, Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Service products and/or available Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), technologies, and enterprise services to accomplish the Armys three enterprise IT goals: to improve the delivery of IT enterprise services; increase the security of its information and networks; and reduce the total cost of ownership of its IT Enterprise. Second, ensure that the contractor applies sound system engineering principles to manage program cost, schedule, performance, risks, warranties, vendors, and data required to deliver an effective and affordable service that meets the stated performance requirements.  Finally, exercise program insight versus oversight by ensuring that the contractor provides the Government with clear and continuous insight into program schedule, technical performance, and risk.  <BR><BR>2.2.1	Integrated Product Teams (IPTs) - The contractor shall participate in IPTs that may include several Government agencies and contractors.  Working level IPTs will be established as necessary.<BR><BR>2.2.2	Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) -  GFE has not yet been determined.  The governments objective is not to invest in, or purchase, any additional capital equipment. Industry partners shall allow for the use of Government-owned equipment and facilities, to include the APCs, and TNOSCs at various global locations. The contractor is free to propose reutilization of current GFE, use of contractor provided equipment, and a combination of both. The contractor shall ensure requirements are articulated that allow the enterprise services to be provisioned across the full spectrum of available means ranging from Application as a Service (AaaS) and/or Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) to Government Owned and Government Operated to ensure the best overall value to the Government.<BR><BR>2.3	AFFORDABILITY <BR><BR>2.3.1	Best Value principles will be applied to ensure that the services are affordable.  The Government desires to partner with industry in order to achieve a best value environment and solicit innovations that will optimize operations and supportability processes. <BR><BR>2.3.2	The Government will provide a sample task to allow industry to demonstrate how their services would be delivered.  This will allow the Government to identify/mitigate risks.  <BR><BR>2.4	PROGRAM SCHEDULE:<BR><BR>Interim Release #1		25 NOV 08<BR>Interim Release #2		18 DEC 08<BR>Draft RFP Release		5 JAN 09<BR>RFP Release			TBD<BR>Contract Award		TBD<BR>Initial Services		TBD<BR><BR><BR>2.5	SUMMARY - This Draft SOO is provided to inform vendors of Governments intent to release an RFP in the future for a 5-year IDIQ contract with 5 ea 1-year options for services in support of the NSC construct.

<a href="mailto:charlene.duncan@va.gov">Notice of Intent to SS -- VA-260-09-RP-0057</a>
<DESC>CathPCI Registry Program, American College of Cardiology, Membership SubscriptionThe Puget Sound Healthcare System intends to establish a sole source contract with the American College of Cardiology Foundation for a membership subscription to the CathPCI Registery.  The contract will be a fixed price contract and will be for a base and 4 option periods.  Each period will be for 1 calendar year.  The proposed action will be solicited and negotiated with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all written responses received by 11:00 pm Pacific Time on 12/10/2008 will be considered by the Government.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  SCOPE:  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has an ongoing requirement to monitor the quality of the cardiac care that it provides to veteran patients and to compare the results of this care to the care provided to patients that are treated outside of VA.  BACKGROUND:  In 2003, the results of a two-year study conducted by Price, Waterhouse, Coopers and Harvard University indicated that the cardiac care provided to veterans by VA was not up to the standards provided to patients that were treated outside VA.  VA established a Blue Ribbon Commission on Cardiac Care that reviewed this study and set forth a number of recommendations that VA has incorporated in the effort to improve cardiac care to veterans.  The American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF) has developed the National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR). The NCDR is the only recognized national registry/database that collects and reports on standardized national clinical cardiovascular data.   Use of the NCDR permits confidential comparisons of a participant's data with national or regional summary data in order to monitor cardiac care performance in an effort to improve patient care.  To ensure consistency of data collection, comparison, and analysis, VA intends to collect and submit cardiovascular data to the NCDR in an effort to monitor and improve the cardiac care it provides to veterans. The VA plans to begin by participating in the NCDR's CathPCI Registry which captures data on patients who have diagnostic cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention. The VA may in the future consider participation in the ICD Registry capturing data on implantable cardiac defibrillators, the CARE Registry collecting data on carotid stenting and carotid endarterectomy procedures, and the ACTION-GWTG Registry collecting data on acute coronary syndrome patients.  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:  Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has over 75 facilities that have cardiac catheterization capabilities, including 54 that perform percutaneous coronary intervention procedures.  VHA has developed a VISTA compatible program, the Cardiovascular Assessment, Reporting and Tracking System (CART), which allows facilitation of the reporting of cath laboratory procedures.   This program consists of three modules; pre-cath assessment, diagnostic cath report, and interventional procedure report.  Additional modules are in development and will be added at later dates.  The CART data reside on servers at the Denver VA which is the clinical and technical coordinating center for CART.  Administrative functions are located at VA Puget Sound Health Care System and are managed by the Ischemic Heart Disease QuERI located with in the HSR&D NW Center of Excellence.  The CART application collects data and stores that data in the CART database located on VA servers at Denver.  CART will transmit, in aggregate, data to the ACCF/NCDR.  Data for all VA cath labs will be transmitted to NCDR with facilities de-identified (a confidential site id will be used).  Data transmissions will be composed of multiple batches, and each batch will contain data from a single VA facility. All data quality reports and site level reports from NCDR will be sent back to Denver VA.  NCDR will provide CART center at Denver VA with VA to VA benchmarks as well as VA to NCDR benchmarks.  Denver VA will maintain a crosswalk to the confidential site ids to enable them to distribute facility-level reports that come back from NCDR.  SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:  VA will submit a data record on all veteran patients who receive medical care in a Cath Lab or similar facility and who are eligible for inclusion in the CathPCI Registry This data will be submitted on a quarterly basis and in accordance with the data elements, definitions, and transmission format required by the NCDR (www.accncdr.com).  VA will submit its data within 90 days of the completion of each calendar quarter.  The ACCF will accept and analyze that data which meets the process and standards established by the NCDR and will generate Data Quality Reports within 30 days of each data submission.  NCDR software upgrades / technical refreshers will be included without additional charges.

OPM SPECIFIC CLAUSES

1752.205-70	Announcement of Contract Award

	OPM complies with FAR 5.3, Synopses of Contract Awards, in terms of synopsizing and publicly announcing contract awards. These actions take place at the time of, and not before, the contract is awarded. Contract award, in this case, means signature of the contractual document by the Contracting Officer and forwarding of the contractual document to the contract awardee. If the contract awardee wishes to make a separate public announcement, the awardee must obtain the approval of the Contracting Officer prior to releasing the announcement, and must plan to make announcement only after the contract has been awarded.

1752.209-74	Organizational Conflicts of Interest 

	(a)	The Contractor warrants that, to the best of the Contractors knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which could give rise to an organizational conflict of interest (OCI), as defined in FAR 9.5, Organizational and Consultants Conflicts of Interest, or that the Contractor has disclosed all such relevant information.

	(b)	The Contractor agrees that if an actual or potential OCI is discovered after award, the Contractor shall make a full disclosure in writing to the Contracting Officer. This disclosure must include a description of actions, which the Contractor has taken or proposes to take, after consultation with the Contracting Officer, to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the actual or potential conflict.

	(c)	The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary to avoid an OCI. If the Contractor was aware of a potential OCI prior to award or discovered an actual or potential conflict after award and did not disclose or misrepresented relevant information to the Contacting Office, the Government may terminate the contract for default, debar the Contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.

	(d)	The Contractor must include this clause in all subcontracts and in lower tier subcontracts unless a waiver is requested from, and granted by, the Contracting Officer.

	(e)	In the event that a requirement changes in such a way as to create a potential conflict of interest for the Contractor, the Contractor must: 
	(1)	Notify the Contracting Officer of a potential conflict, and;
	(2)	Recommend to the Government an alternate approach which would avoid the potential conflict, or
		(3)	Present for approval a conflict of interest mitigation plan that will:
			(i)	Describe in detail the changed requirement that creates the potential conflict of interest; and
			(ii)	Outline in detail the actions to be taken by the Contractor or the Government in the performance of the task to mitigate the conflict, division of subcontractor effort, and limited access to information, or other acceptable means.
	(4)	The Contractor must not commence work on a changed requirement related to a potential conflict of interest until specifically notified by the Contracting Officer to proceed.
	(5)	If the Contracting Officer determines that it is in the best interest of the Government to proceed with work, notwithstanding a conflict of interest, a request for waiver must be submitted in accordance with FAR 9.503.

1752.222-70	Notice of Requirement for Certification of Nonsegregated Facilities 

	By signing this offer or contract, the contractor will be deemed to have signed and agreed to the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Clause 52.222-21, Certification of Nonsegregated Facilities, incorporated by reference in this solicitation/contract. The certification provides that the bidder or offeror does not maintain or provide for its employees, facilities which are segregated on a basis of race, color, religion, or national origin, whether such facilities are segregated by directive or on a de facto basis. The certification also provides that the bidder/offeror does not and will not permit its employees to perform their services at any location under its control where segregated facilities are maintained.

<DESC>COMMERCIAL COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  

The solicitation number is AG-0120-S-09-0001 and this solicitation is issued as a request for proposal (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-27.  This is a small business set-aside with an associated NAICS code of 541990 and small business size standard of $7 million.

The following are this solicitations list of contract line item number(s) and items, quantities and units of measure:  
1. Organize and facilitate meetings to be held in Anchorage and in all the communities of Prince William Sound (see approximate meeting schedule in item C); 
2.  Collect, evaluate, and synthesize information gathered during meetings.  
Price each line item as a lump sum to include all necessary travel expenses, materials, supplies, incidentals and supervision.

Description of requirement:  Performance Work Statement, Prince William Sound Regional MapGuide
A. General
The contractor shall provide project management, community engagement, and facilitation expertise for a project that brings together a broad range of stakeholders  citizens, landowners, scientists - in Prince William Sound to create a social and biophysical mapguide of the Sound, its communities, and critical resources (particularly those still recovering from the Exxon Valdez oil spill, EVOS).  Please visit National Geographics geotourism mapping products and process as one potential model to draw from.
The final product shall provide the public with a visual representation of the Sound and its recovery after 20 years, including the intersection of injured resources and services and the economic, cultural, and subsistence value of these resources and services to the communities.  The mapguide will create a visual and narrative record of the resources, services, and stories that define the Sound, and communicate a vision for how they should be shared and protected in the face of increasing human use.  It will serve as an educational tool for guiding human users in the Sound in such a manner that increasing use does not result in confounding the recovery of resources and services injured by the spill.  The mapguide will be a high-quality, widely distributed, interpretive product produced by Alaska Geographic.  It will be available as both a hard document and a web-accessible internet graphic.  Alaska Geographic staff will serve as part of the project team.
The contractor shall help organize and lead the map development process by, among other things, facilitating the collection and integration of information (e.g. broad themes and specific stories) about the Sound, while also assisting the communities in developing a vision for place that takes into consideration critical human uses, such as recreation/tourism.  In this role, the contractor shall work with Forest Service staff to coordinate the mapguide citizen engagement schedule with the public outreach work of the Prince William Sound Marine Trail Steering Committee, currently coordinated by the National Wildlife Federation.  The Forest Service recently signed a Memorandum of Understanind with Alaska State Parks, National Wildlife Federation, National Park Service and the Prince William Sound Economic Development District to develop a cooperative framework for the planning, development, and maintenance of a Prince William Sound marine trail.  The marine trail and mapguide projects share many of the same goals, including the desire to educate and guide human uses to aid the recovery of resources and services injured by the oil spill.  In order to ensure maximum public participation in both projects, close coordination is critical.
The heart of the community engagement work will, ideally, occur between January and April of 2009, although follow-up meetings may be necessary in late Summer, early Fall.  Workshops and meetings will be necessary in Anchorage, Whittier, Cordova, Valdez, Tatitlek and Chenega.  Due to winter weather in the Sound, there may be opportunities to host workshops with crucial stakeholders from Tatitlek and Chenega in Anchorage, as well.  We hope, when possible, to build workshops around existing activities and events, such as the annual Alaska Wilderness Recreation & Tourism Association (AWRTA) meeting.  
Forest Service personnel will be available to assist with coordination, outreach and other duties (see below for more details). It is expected that techniques used to solicit information and stories for the map will be highly interactive and creative and reach a wide-range of participants, including youth. Sessions should not follow traditional public meeting/testimony formats.  The public will have the opportunity to work closely with EVOS researchers and other local and regional experts during these sessions to see how proposed stories overlap with ecological, cultural and human hotspots and a variety of other critical data returned from years of studying the Sound.
Key EVOS-related objectives, include:
 Guiding and managing human use and behavior to aid recovery of injured resources, critical habitat and human services (notably recreation/tourism); protecting against further impacts, and mitigating user conflicts
 Addressing passive use values  a category of recovery that has received less attention  in the most comprehensive approach to date.  This includes educating residents and visitors alike on the story of recovery, resources, and human services/uses.  
 Increasing the involvement of spill area communities in the restoration effort and improve the communication of findings and results of restoration efforts to spill area inhabitants.
 Improving the communication of traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) from local residents to scientists, which can significantly enhance the value of restoration efforts.
 Contributing to the recovery of the subsistence service by mapping and communicating the intersection of resources and services, and incorporating stories that communicate the importance of gathering and hunting traditional resources to community identity and survival.  
 Highlighting the history of commercial fishing in the Sound, its meaning to the local economy and sense of place, and locations of critical import to fishing families.
 Educating the public about, and thus continuing to contribute to the protection of, the Wilderness Study Area and archaeological resources, now considered recovered but continually exposed to the threat of injury as a result of increasing human use in the Sound.

B. Location
Work and meetings shall be held in Anchorage and in all communities of Prince William Sound  Whittier, Chenega, Valdez, Tatitlek, Cordova.

I. Introduction
The Boise, Payette and Sawtooth National Forests (NFs), referred to as the Southwest Idaho Ecogroup (SWIE), will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to disclose the environmental effects of proposed non-significant amendments to three SWIE Land and Resources Management Plans (Forest Plans). Amendments to the 2003 Forest Plans for the Boise, Payette and Sawtooth NFs will add and/or modify existing management direction, as needed, to implement a comprehensive, Forest Plan-level Wildlife Conservation Strategy (WCS). This WCS will identify both short- and long-term management strategies and priorities for maintaining and restoring habitats associated with terrestrial wildlife species. The proposed non-significant amendments will provide management direction and guidance that focuses on those habitats, and their associated species, identified in the WCS as being of greatest conservation concern during the current planning period (i.e., next 10 to 15 years).
The SWIE is composed of an estimated 6.6 million acres of National Forest System lands in southwest Idaho. The SWIE administrative boundaries stretch west to the Oregon border, east to the Salmon-Challis NF, north to the Nez Perce NF, and south to Box Elder County, Utah.
Because the WCS and related amendments have the potential to address a myriad of species and associated habitats, the amendment process has been divided between four phases, each with its individual EIS:
This Solicitation
Phase 1: Forested Biological Community (EIS and decision to be developed 2008 - 2009)
Phase 2: Rangeland Biological Community (2009  2010)
Later Solicitations
Phase 3: Unique Combinations of Forested and Rangeland Communities (2010  2011)
Phase 4: Riverine and Non-Riverine Riparian and Wetland Communities (2011  2012)
This Statement of Work has been developed to reflect a base item, namely, preparation of a draft EIS for Phase 1. Appendix A reflects two options for potential future work: Option 1 covers preparation of a final EIS for Phase 1; Option 2 reflects development of a draft EIS for Phase 2.
Terminology
The writing/editing entity will be referred to in this document as Contractor. The SWIE will be referred to as Forest Service. Case Manager is the Forest Service principal contact listed on the cover sheet. Project Manager is the Contractor as identified following contract award.
II. Documenting Environmental Analysis Under NEPA
The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) has two requirements for compliance:
A. Agencies must make informed decisions. Informed means a candid and factual presentation of environmental impacts. Reasonable alternatives must be available and considered by the decision maker before making a commitment of resources.
B. Agencies must make diligent efforts to involve the public in their NEPA procedures. The definition of diligent varies by agency depending on the severity of impact and other factors. Each project requires an individual approach to involving the public.
NEPA does not regulate agency choices. But it does demand a good faith, hard look at the potential environmental impacts and a full and honest disclosure of impacts to the public.
Ultimately, completion of the NEPA process is the responsibility of the agency official making the decision. When the environmental analysis is documented through use of a Contractor, the process must comply not only with the NEPA and CEQ regulations (40 CFR parts 1500-1508), but also agency requirements. The primary source of NEPA policy and procedures for the Forest Service is Forest Service Handbook (FSH) 1909.15, Environmental Policy and Procedures Handbook, as amended in 2008. The Forest Service is ultimately and legally responsible for the accuracy of the environmental analysis and documentation, and is responsible for issuing a final decision that is defensible under the law.
III. Scope of Work
The Scope of Work involves writing, editing, formatting and illustrating a draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for Phase 1 of the WCS (Forested Biological Community), using technical reports, maps and information provided by the Forest Service. The Scope of Work also includes editing, formatting and illustrating identified technical reports (species reports). Contractor shall furnish all materials, supplies, tools, equipment, personnel, travel except those specified to be furnished by the Government, as noted below.
IV. Summary of Tasks and Technical Specifications
Contractor shall be responsible for completing the following tasks and meeting the technical specifications herein:
A. Orientation: Attend at least one meeting at the Boise NF Supervisors Office with one or more members of the Forest staff to gain familiarity with the project area, environmental conditions and proposed action.
B. Work Plan and Timeline: Develop and manage a detailed project work plan, including specific tasks, when they will be completed and by whom.
C. Coordination with Case Manager: Contractor will coordinate regularly with the Forest Service project Case Manager regarding the document development and reviews. Contractor will communicate at least weekly with the Case Manager to coordinate activities and provide updates of progress and significant developments, using phone, e-mail or visits.
Contractor will communicate directly with the Case Manager to request specific information required from the Forest Service. Requests for information shall be made in writing, and shall include specifications regarding format and content and a not-to-exceed due date for receiving that information. The Case Manager will clarify information needs with Contractor as needed.
Contractor must follow the Case Managers advice regarding the Forests preferred NEPA procedures and document specifications.
D. Technical Reports: The Forest Service shall provide to the Contractor draft Technical Reports for editing and formatting. These Technical Reports will consist of a total of 44 individual reports (36 individual species reports and 8 family reports for the Boise and Payette National Forests). The purpose of these Technical Reports is to provide supporting data, information, and analysis for the EIS. As appropriate, contractor shall incorporate the important conclusions from the Technical Reports into the EIS, along with summary rationale for the conclusions.
E. Organize and Develop the Draft EIS with cover letters, and distribute to Case Manager for Forest Service review. Edit the documents to incorporate reviewers comments, and defer to the Case
Managers judgment if editing questions or conflicts should arise. The Case Manager will be the liaison between Contractor and the Responsible Official to ensure that expectations are being met.
F. Prepare the EIS and Distribute for Notice and Comment Process: The completed draft EIS, public mailing, and publication of the Notice of Availability (NOA) in the Federal Register will initiate a formal comment period. The length of this formal comment period has yet to be determined, but will likely be either 45 or 90 days. Contractor shall send copies to a mailing list provided by the Forest Service (approximately 600-800 names). The EIS will also be provided to the Forest Service in an electronic .pdf format for placement on our external web site to be available electronically to the general public. The Forest Service will prepare and submit the NOA to the Federal Register.
G. Duplication and Mail Services: Contractor is required to provide any duplication or publication services, except for those documents that must be published by the Government Printing Office (GPO). GPO publication requirements will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Contractor is responsible for copying, collating and mailing documents to the public. The Case Manager is responsible for getting the required signature of the Responsible Official.
V. Materials Provided by the Forest Service
The Forest Service shall provide the following materials, both in electronic and hard copy:
A. Draft Technical Reports for editing and formatting
B. Analysis materials needed to prepare the EIS, including specialist reports, a description of alternatives to be considered in detail and those eliminated from detailed study, a description of issues (including associated indicators)
C. Maps, including vicinity maps and those needed to illustrate key points
D. Envelopes and mailing labels.
VI. Documentation
A. Working documents produced by Contractor shall be submitted to the Forest Service in Microsoft Word format. To expedite Forest Service reviews, Contractor is encouraged to e-mail, or post to an external FTP site identified by the Forest Service, draft and final documents. Track changes will be used to note stylistic and substantive edits. (Track changes will not be used to identify corrections to spelling and grammar.)
B. The EIS and Technical Reports (the documents) must be written in a manner that facilitates public review and understanding.
The EIS and Technical Reports will be professionally written and edited:
 The documents will be accurate in spelling and punctuation, and free of typographical errors.
 Sentences will be integrated as components within a paragraph, such that the order of the sentences is logical and anticipates readers questions and processing of information.
 Paragraphs will be integrated as components within a section, such that the order of the paragraphs is logical and anticipates readers questions and processing of information. Paragraphs have effective transitions to guide the reader.
 Each resource-specific effects discussion in Chapter III of the EIS will be presented such that the conclusion is well-supported and logical. In addition, the effects discussions within Chapter III will
be internally consistent, such that the conclusions in one section do not contradict those in another section.
The EIS shall be a concise public document. Rather than the document consisting entirely of long narratives, use bulleted or numbered statements where appropriate, and display quantitative data in tables or charts, where they may aid in public review and understanding.
Use a simple and consistent outline format throughout the documents, with clear headings and sub-headings.
Tables and figures will be formatted consistently within the documents, and the formatting will conform to relevant style guides. Tables and figures will be formatted such that they are legible in second- and third-generation copies.
Avoid using agency or bureaucratic jargon or acronyms. Where a technical term is needed, include a brief, simple translation of the term within the context where it is used, to avoid the reader having to rely entirely on the glossary.
Translate technical or jargon-filled language into plain, easy to understand language.
Technical Reports will be organized and formatted in a consistent manner, using a Contractor-developed template.
If supporting record documents contain repetitive or poorly organized effects analysis discussions, translate them in the EIS into clear, concise, well-organized statements.
Ensure that the effects analysis in the EIS includes:
 Rationale, professional judgments and references to scientific studies that support the conclusions and help shed light on the degree of uncertainty or reliability of effects predictions.
 Explanations of the action or cause for each effect.
 Descriptions of location, magnitude/intensity, and general duration of effects.
 Direct, indirect and cumulative effects to the resources discussed.
 Avoid repetition, focusing on differences in effects between alternatives, so readers may easily contrast and compare alternatives, based on the effects described.
 Incorporation of scientific material by reference, by summarizing and citing appropriate literature. References will be included as an EIS chapter.
C. The EIS must be site-specific to the areas of National Forest identified for analysis, action-specific (to the proposed activities) and effect-specific (resulting from the proposed activities).
D. The description of the Affected Environment is required in an EIS. However, the Affected Environment can be combined with Environmental Consequences into one chapter, as a preface to the consequences described for each specific resource topic.
E. The EIS format should closely follow this main-topic outline, unless changes are approved by the Case Manager:

Hard copy record documents shall be single-side copies with no staples. Contractor shall prepare copies for mailing; quantity will be dependant on number of scoping respondents.
Appendix A
Potential Options for Future Work
Option 1 - Preparing a Final EIS & Final Technical Reports  The decision to exercise this option will be made by April 1, 2009.
Under Option 1, the Scope of Work involves writing, editing, formatting and illustrating a final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for Phase 1 of the WCS, using technical reports, maps and information provided by the Forest Service. The Scope of Work also includes editing, formatting and illustrating final Technical Reports (species reports). Option 1 would be undertaken following the formal comment period on the draft EIS. Essentially, Option 1 reflects the revision of the draft documents into final form, reflecting both public comment and new information gained following publication of the draft documents.
The basis for both items (i.e., the final EIS and Technical Reports) will be the draft EIS and Technical Reports described in the base item. All tasks, specifications, responsibility for materials, and work products described in sections IV, V and VI in the base item would apply to Option 1, with one addition: development of a chapter in the final EIS that displays public comments on the draft EIS and the Forest Service response to those comments. The Forest Service would provide public comments and responses for Contractor editing and formatting of this chapter, both in electronic and hard copy. In addition, the Forest Service will provide comments on the draft Technical Reports.
Option 2 - Preparing a Draft EIS & Technical Reports  The decision to exercise this option will be made by April 1, 2010.
Under Option 2, the Scope of Work involves writing, editing, formatting and illustrating a draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for Phase 2 of the WCS (Rangeland Biological Community), using technical reports, maps and information provided by the Forest Service. The Scope of Work also includes editing, formatting and illustrating identified Technical Reports (species reports). The number of Technical Reports is unknown at this time, although the total number is anticipated to be less than under the base item. All tasks, specifications, responsibility for materials, and work products described under the base item would apply to Option 2. In addition, Contractor would be strongly encouraged to model the format and style of Option 2 to mirror that of the base item, such that the two products are consistent, and readily-identifiable as integrated components of a larger effort (i.e., the WCS).

(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;
(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In
the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
(ii) Examples.
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

(2) o Outside the United States.
(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies
(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.

(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
(2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offerors relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

I. Introduction
The Boise, Payette and Sawtooth National Forests (NFs), referred to as the Southwest Idaho Ecogroup (SWIE), will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to disclose the environmental effects of proposed non-significant amendments to three SWIE Land and Resources Management Plans (Forest Plans). Amendments to the 2003 Forest Plans for the Boise, Payette and Sawtooth NFs will add and/or modify existing management direction, as needed, to implement a comprehensive, Forest Plan-level Wildlife Conservation Strategy (WCS). This WCS will identify both short- and long-term management strategies and priorities for maintaining and restoring habitats associated with terrestrial wildlife species. The proposed non-significant amendments will provide management direction and guidance that focuses on those habitats, and their associated species, identified in the WCS as being of greatest conservation concern during the current planning period (i.e., next 10 to 15 years).
The SWIE is composed of an estimated 6.6 million acres of National Forest System lands in southwest Idaho. The SWIE administrative boundaries stretch west to the Oregon border, east to the Salmon-Challis NF, north to the Nez Perce NF, and south to Box Elder County, Utah.
Because the WCS and related amendments have the potential to address a myriad of species and associated habitats, the amendment process has been divided between four phases, each with its individual EIS:
This Solicitation
Phase 1: Forested Biological Community (EIS and decision to be developed 2008 - 2009)
Phase 2: Rangeland Biological Community (2009  2010)
Later Solicitations
Phase 3: Unique Combinations of Forested and Rangeland Communities (2010  2011)
Phase 4: Riverine and Non-Riverine Riparian and Wetland Communities (2011  2012)
This Statement of Work has been developed to reflect a base item, namely, preparation of a draft EIS for Phase 1. Appendix A reflects two options for potential future work: Option 1 covers preparation of a final EIS for Phase 1; Option 2 reflects development of a draft EIS for Phase 2.
Terminology
The writing/editing entity will be referred to in this document as Contractor. The SWIE will be referred to as Forest Service. Case Manager is the Forest Service principal contact listed on the cover sheet. Project Manager is the Contractor as identified following contract award.
II. Documenting Environmental Analysis Under NEPA
The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) has two requirements for compliance:
A. Agencies must make informed decisions. Informed means a candid and factual presentation of environmental impacts. Reasonable alternatives must be available and considered by the decision maker before making a commitment of resources.
B. Agencies must make diligent efforts to involve the public in their NEPA procedures. The definition of diligent varies by agency depending on the severity of impact and other factors. Each project requires an individual approach to involving the public.
NEPA does not regulate agency choices. But it does demand a good faith, hard look at the potential environmental impacts and a full and honest disclosure of impacts to the public.
Ultimately, completion of the NEPA process is the responsibility of the agency official making the decision. When the environmental analysis is documented through use of a Contractor, the process must comply not only with the NEPA and CEQ regulations (40 CFR parts 1500-1508), but also agency requirements. The primary source of NEPA policy and procedures for the Forest Service is Forest Service Handbook (FSH) 1909.15, Environmental Policy and Procedures Handbook, as amended in 2008. The Forest Service is ultimately and legally responsible for the accuracy of the environmental analysis and documentation, and is responsible for issuing a final decision that is defensible under the law.
III. Scope of Work
The Scope of Work involves writing, editing, formatting and illustrating a draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for Phase 1 of the WCS (Forested Biological Community), using technical reports, maps and information provided by the Forest Service. The Scope of Work also includes editing, formatting and illustrating identified technical reports (species reports). Contractor shall furnish all materials, supplies, tools, equipment, personnel, travel except those specified to be furnished by the Government, as noted below.
IV. Summary of Tasks and Technical Specifications
Contractor shall be responsible for completing the following tasks and meeting the technical specifications herein:
A. Orientation: Attend at least one meeting at the Boise NF Supervisors Office with one or more members of the Forest staff to gain familiarity with the project area, environmental conditions and proposed action.
B. Work Plan and Timeline: Develop and manage a detailed project work plan, including specific tasks, when they will be completed and by whom.
C. Coordination with Case Manager: Contractor will coordinate regularly with the Forest Service project Case Manager regarding the document development and reviews. Contractor will communicate at least weekly with the Case Manager to coordinate activities and provide updates of progress and significant developments, using phone, e-mail or visits.
Contractor will communicate directly with the Case Manager to request specific information required from the Forest Service. Requests for information shall be made in writing, and shall include specifications regarding format and content and a not-to-exceed due date for receiving that information. The Case Manager will clarify information needs with Contractor as needed.
Contractor must follow the Case Managers advice regarding the Forests preferred NEPA procedures and document specifications.
D. Technical Reports: The Forest Service shall provide to the Contractor draft Technical Reports for editing and formatting. These Technical Reports will consist of a total of 44 individual reports (36 individual species reports and 8 family reports for the Boise and Payette National Forests). The purpose of these Technical Reports is to provide supporting data, information, and analysis for the EIS. As appropriate, contractor shall incorporate the important conclusions from the Technical Reports into the EIS, along with summary rationale for the conclusions.
E. Organize and Develop the Draft EIS with cover letters, and distribute to Case Manager for Forest Service review. Edit the documents to incorporate reviewers comments, and defer to the Case
Managers judgment if editing questions or conflicts should arise. The Case Manager will be the liaison between Contractor and the Responsible Official to ensure that expectations are being met.
F. Prepare the EIS and Distribute for Notice and Comment Process: The completed draft EIS, public mailing, and publication of the Notice of Availability (NOA) in the Federal Register will initiate a formal comment period. The length of this formal comment period has yet to be determined, but will likely be either 45 or 90 days. Contractor shall send copies to a mailing list provided by the Forest Service (approximately 600-800 names). The EIS will also be provided to the Forest Service in an electronic .pdf format for placement on our external web site to be available electronically to the general public. The Forest Service will prepare and submit the NOA to the Federal Register.
G. Duplication and Mail Services: Contractor is required to provide any duplication or publication services, except for those documents that must be published by the Government Printing Office (GPO). GPO publication requirements will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Contractor is responsible for copying, collating and mailing documents to the public. The Case Manager is responsible for getting the required signature of the Responsible Official.
V. Materials Provided by the Forest Service
The Forest Service shall provide the following materials, both in electronic and hard copy:
A. Draft Technical Reports for editing and formatting
B. Analysis materials needed to prepare the EIS, including specialist reports, a description of alternatives to be considered in detail and those eliminated from detailed study, a description of issues (including associated indicators)
C. Maps, including vicinity maps and those needed to illustrate key points
D. Envelopes and mailing labels.
VI. Documentation
A. Working documents produced by Contractor shall be submitted to the Forest Service in Microsoft Word format. To expedite Forest Service reviews, Contractor is encouraged to e-mail, or post to an external FTP site identified by the Forest Service, draft and final documents. Track changes will be used to note stylistic and substantive edits. (Track changes will not be used to identify corrections to spelling and grammar.)
B. The EIS and Technical Reports (the documents) must be written in a manner that facilitates public review and understanding.
The EIS and Technical Reports will be professionally written and edited:
 The documents will be accurate in spelling and punctuation, and free of typographical errors.
 Sentences will be integrated as components within a paragraph, such that the order of the sentences is logical and anticipates readers questions and processing of information.
 Paragraphs will be integrated as components within a section, such that the order of the paragraphs is logical and anticipates readers questions and processing of information. Paragraphs have effective transitions to guide the reader.
 Each resource-specific effects discussion in Chapter III of the EIS will be presented such that the conclusion is well-supported and logical. In addition, the effects discussions within Chapter III will
be internally consistent, such that the conclusions in one section do not contradict those in another section.
The EIS shall be a concise public document. Rather than the document consisting entirely of long narratives, use bulleted or numbered statements where appropriate, and display quantitative data in tables or charts, where they may aid in public review and understanding.
Use a simple and consistent outline format throughout the documents, with clear headings and sub-headings.
.
Tables and figures will be formatted consistently within the documents, and the formatting will conform to relevant style guides. Tables and figures will be formatted such that they are legible in second- and third-generation copies.
Avoid using agency or bureaucratic jargon or acronyms. Where a technical term is needed, include a brief, simple translation of the term within the context where it is used, to avoid the reader having to rely entirely on the glossary.
Translate technical or jargon-filled language into plain, easy to understand language.
Technical Reports will be organized and formatted in a consistent manner, using a Contractor-developed template.
If supporting record documents contain repetitive or poorly organized effects analysis discussions, translate them in the EIS into clear, concise, well-organized statements.
Ensure that the effects analysis in the EIS includes:
 Rationale, professional judgments and references to scientific studies that support the conclusions and help shed light on the degree of uncertainty or reliability of effects predictions.
 Explanations of the action or cause for each effect.
 Descriptions of location, magnitude/intensity, and general duration of effects.
 Direct, indirect and cumulative effects to the resources discussed.
 Avoid repetition, focusing on differences in effects between alternatives, so readers may easily contrast and compare alternatives, based on the effects described.
 Incorporation of scientific material by reference, by summarizing and citing appropriate literature. References will be included as an EIS chapter.
C. The EIS must be site-specific to the areas of National Forest identified for analysis, action-specific (to the proposed activities) and effect-specific (resulting from the proposed activities).
D. The description of the Affected Environment is required in an EIS. However, the Affected Environment can be combined with Environmental Consequences into one chapter, as a preface to the consequences described for each specific resource topic.
E. The EIS format should closely follow this main-topic outline, unless changes are approved by the Case Manager:

VII. Work Products
Work products shall be addressed to the Forest Service Case Manager:
Deliverables shall be paper copies, facsimiles, and/or electronic copies as specified. Electronic word processing documents shall be Microsoft Word. Final documents shall be delivered on a compact disk in Microsoft Word and .pdf formats. Where multiple copies are indicated, it will be understood these are to be paper copies. Elsewhere where copy media is unspecified, it will be the option of Contractor to provide the materials by either paper copy or electronic copy.
The Forest Service will review all draft materials. Generally, one review and correction cycle will be sufficient prior to printing final materials. However, based upon the amount or complexity of the Forest Services revision comments, the Forest Service shall have the option of reviewing drafts until they are revised to the Forest Services satisfaction.
All documents shall be published to Forest Service standards. Contractor, under the direction and guidance of the Forest Service, shall be responsible for printing and distributing all documents, except for those that must be published by the GPO. GPO publication requirements will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Contractor shall provide all graphics, layout services and printing to established Forest Service standards. Foldout sheets and large maps shall be provided where applicable. Mailings shall be first class.
A. Work Plan: Within 30 days of contract award, Contractor shall submit a work plan. The work plan shall be a comprehensive plan and schedule for completion of all aspects of the task order, following the schedule prepared in cooperation with the Forest Service. The work plan shall account for all the tasks within the scope of this task order, deliverables listed below, preparation time, and review time for each draft by the Forest Service.
B. Technical Reports: Technical Reports provided by the Forest Service are to be edited and formatted in conformance with Forest Service standards and guidelines. Preliminary Technical Reports (two copies of each) shall be submitted prior to, or concurrent with, a preliminary draft EIS.
C. Draft EIS (Final): Contractor shall provide a final draft EIS in camera-ready format. This format must facilitate web posting and browsing, as well as a format from which hard copies can be made. Hard copy record documents shall be single-side copies with no staples. Contractor shall prepare copies for mailing; quantity will be dependant on number of scoping respondents.
Appendix A
Potential Options for Future Work
Option 1 - Preparing a Final EIS & Final Technical Reports  The decision to exercise this option will be made by April 1, 2009.
Under Option 1, the Scope of Work involves writing, editing, formatting and illustrating a final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for Phase 1 of the WCS, using technical reports, maps and information provided by the Forest Service. The Scope of Work also includes editing, formatting and illustrating final Technical Reports (species reports). Option 1 would be undertaken following the formal comment period on the draft EIS. Essentially, Option 1 reflects the revision of the draft documents into final form, reflecting both public comment and new information gained following publication of the draft documents.
The basis for both items (i.e., the final EIS and Technical Reports) will be the draft EIS and Technical Reports described in the base item. All tasks, specifications, responsibility for materials, and work products described in sections IV, V and VI in the base item would apply to Option 1, with one addition: development of a chapter in the final EIS that displays public comments on the draft EIS and the Forest Service response to those comments. The Forest Service would provide public comments and responses for Contractor editing and formatting of this chapter, both in electronic and hard copy. In addition, the Forest Service will provide comments on the draft Technical Reports.
Option 2 - Preparing a Draft EIS & Technical Reports  The decision to exercise this option will be made by April 1, 2010.
Under Option 2, the Scope of Work involves writing, editing, formatting and illustrating a draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for Phase 2 of the WCS (Rangeland Biological Community), using technical reports, maps and information provided by the Forest Service. The Scope of Work also includes editing, formatting and illustrating identified Technical Reports (species reports). The number of Technical Reports is unknown at this time, although the total number is anticipated to be less than under the base item. All tasks, specifications, responsibility for materials, and work products described under the base item would apply to Option 2. In addition, Contractor would be strongly encouraged to model the format and style of Option 2 to mirror that of the base item, such that the two products are consistent, and readily-identifiable as integrated components of a larger effort (i.e., the WCS).

SOLICITATION PROVISIONS
FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation  Commercial Items (JAN 1999)
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
1. Experience in writing Environmental Impact Statements consistent with the purposes of and format specified by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)
2. Experience in synthesizing scientific concepts related to natural resource management, including wildlife biology, and translating into clear, concise language to aid in public review and understanding
3. Technical capability to design, edit and format lengthy documents, including correlation of photos and illustrations with text, to meet the Government requirement
4. Ability to adhere to strict timelines as set forth in solicitation
These factors are more important than price.
(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals
(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;

(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In
the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
(ii) Examples.
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ?more than 50 percent? for ?at least 80 percent? each place it appears.

    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.

    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights.

<DESC><p>The following question was asked by a vendor.&nbsp; I am posting the question and corresponding response so that the award process can be as fair as possible.&nbsp; <br />
<p>Question:</p>
<p>Greetings Brady:&nbsp; Our company&nbsp;is interested in submitting a proposal for your Cisco phone support FA8224-08-R-5105 do Nov. 5. You have listed the request as an unbundled SmartNet support product and Cisco does have the product as a bundled Item. Our question is regarding the term of the support. You have requested three one year support packages. There is a greater discount available from Cisco when you order the three years up front. Would the three year or even a two year with a one year renewal be considered or is annual budget the overriding concern?</p>
</p>
<p>Response:</p>
<p>In the past when we have bought these services we have received the bundled price. However regulations restrict us from paying for all three years upfront. We intend to write the contract for a basic year and two option years. I hope this helps answer your question. Thanks!
<p>&nbsp;</p>

The Machines are identical.Question:. I understand you want a 60 mo, $1.00 purchase option capital lease.	Typicallythe monthly payments are made monthly, not annually.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14, NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS, is attached. 

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC>This is a solicitation for worldwide laboratory testing and sampling at a central laboratory. As part of a coordinated Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), United States Navy (USN), and United States Coast Guard (USCG) effort to monitor commercial distillate fuel quality, approximately 49 USCG vessels have been equipped with in line fuel sampling flanges and several Navy ships are in the process of being equipped.  The sampling flanges, supplied as Government furnished equipment (GFE), have been installed in the vessel bunker manifold at the custody transfer point.  A continuous drip sample will be collected by ships personnel from the custody transfer point into a 10-liter disposable sample container.  The sample will be decanted into a 1-gallon shipping container for transport to the in-line sampling laboratory for analysis.  In-line bunkering samples will be obtained for every commercial fuel product taken onboard participating USCG vessels and in select ports for USN vessels.  This will include both DESC Bunker Contracts and Open Market purchases worldwide.  The in-line sampling shipping materials supplied by the Contractor shall include a set of domestic and international shipping labels so that the routine in-line bunker sample may be shipped from the vessel to the Contractor for analysis.  Therefore, the Contractor shall be responsible for a turn-key operation, which includes as a minimum assembling the in-line fuel sampling collection kit, shipping the kits to USCG and USN vessels worldwide, maintaining and updating the in-line fuel sampling instruction manual, the ability to ship fuel samples domestically and/or internationally to the designated analysis laboratory, conducting the required fuel sample analyses, and reporting of the results to DESC, USCG, and USN.

Base period of performance is April 1, 2009 through March 31, 2010 with three (3) successive one-year option periods.  This is an unrestricted procurement with full and open competition.  This will be a fixed price contract.

Due date for offers is December 30, 2008 at 2:00 PM United States Eastern Standard Time (Fort Belvoir Local Time).  Offers must be mailed to the address in the attached solicitation document by the above date and time; no faxed or emailed offers will be accepted.  All responsible sources are invited to submit offers. DESC anticipates conducting negotiations with offerors submitting proposals under the subject solicitation listed above but reserves the right to make contract award based on initial offers submitted.

<DESC><p>Sources Sought Notice/ RFI Questions &amp; Answers
<p>Question (1): Request for clarification of these two areas:</p>
<p>(a) The Rough Order of Magnitude Range section on the survey I understand it as an estimate of the budget that it would take us to provide our service and sustain our duties for a year, but I'm not entirely confident that is what is meant by the ROM range.</p>
<p>Answer: If you are more comfortable giving a single estimated number instead of a range, please do so.</p>
<p>(b) On the Estimated Escalation Basis I'm uncertain what is meant by that as well.</p>
<p>Answer: How much will the option year costs increase over the base year cost?</p>
<p>Question (2): Will ongoing operations, such as Formaldehyde Testing, Unit Repairs, etc, be managed by the contractor, managed by FEMA or included in the scope of work for this mission?</p>
<p>Answer: Formaldehyde testing will be managed under a different contract vehicle; however FEMA intends for the contractor to provide logistics services as described in the RFI (Page 4) to support those THU programs.</p>
<p>Question (3): Will one task order be issued for all 16 sites? Will each site have its own CLIN (budget)?</p>
<p>Answer: At this time, the detailed breakdown of the CLIN table has not been determined.</p>
<p>Question (4): Are T&amp;M rates intended to be site-specific?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes.</p>
<p>Question (5): The description indicates that the government will supply, "... Government Furnished Property and Equipment to perform the tasks requested.</p>
<p>(a) It is anticipated that all equipment and vehicles needed to perform the tasks will be provided as Government Furnished Property at contract award." (page 6).</p>
<p>Answer: Not A Question</p>
<p><br />(b) However, it also says that overtime and surge work will be done on a T&amp;M basis, implying the contractor will also supply materials.</p>
<p>Answer: It is anticipated that all equipment and vehicles needed to perform the tasks will be provided as Government Furnished Property at contract award. However, it is possible that the contractor may be required to provide materials above and beyond what has already been furnished. Those costs will be handled on a T&amp;M basis.</p>
<p>(b) Are procurements to be on FEMA or contractor paper?</p>
<p>Answer: Any resulting contract award will be executed and managed in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), The Department of Homeland Security Acquisition Regulations (HSAR), and Department of Homeland Security Acquisition Manual (HSAM).</p>
<p>(c) If contractor, is cost of material and procurement labor outside of FFP contract?</p>
<p>Answer: It is anticipated that the structure of any resulting contract to be awarded will distinguish FFP services from disaster specific mission support needs. Disaster specific related work activities will be funded with disaster specific funds.</p>
<p><br />(d) Is there an estimate of how much and what types of materials are required?</p>
<p>Answer: See answer to question 5b.</p>
<p>Question (6): Page 4, the Table, under Grounds and Maintenance Support, what is the purpose of "Clean and Make Ready" under THSA Care Taker service (Disposal only), since the units will not be reused?</p>
<p>Answer: All units in the care taker sites are not necessarily scrap, therefore we may require clean and make ready for sale or deployment.</p>
<p>Question (7): Will the Preventative Maintenance program (page 4, the table) and other maintenance programs and duties be specified by FEMA, so that the bidding process on a FFP will be on a level playing field?</p>
<p>Answer: It is anticipated that the structure of any resulting contract will make clear the performance and work activities to be priced as a FFP requirement.</p>
<p>(a) Or is this just a level of effort - number of personnel by labor type for a specified amount of time a day - type of arrangement?</p>
<p>Answer: It is anticipated that any resulting request for proposal and contract award will provide the pricing structure and contract type for the requirement.</p>
<p>Question (8): Page 5, Contract Performance &amp; Execution,</p>
<p>(a) What is the nature of the "non-disaster support services" anticipated at FEMA-HQ?</p>
<p>(b) Is this 8 hrs/day 5 days/wk? Will need to know how many FTEs (full time equivalents), the needed skills sets, and related expenses to plan and estimate.</p>
<p>Answer: FEMA anticipates that all non-disaster support will be 8 hours a day/5 days a week. Additional hours, will be handled by exception. At this point there is no additional information on the magnitude, skill sets or related expenses.</p>
<p>Question (9): Page 8, what is the intent of the FFP performance based ID/IQ contract?</p>
<p>(a) For ID/IQ contracts, isn't CPFF or Cost Plus Award Fee more desirable?</p>
<p>(b) Will the contract include incentives?</p>
<p>Answer: The final determination of an appropriate contract type has not been decided; however, it is anticipated that any resulting contract from this notice will be a performance based acquisition. FEMA is considering the use of incentives and disincentives.</p>
<p>Question (10): What is the anticipated time frame for disposal of the 118,000 units?</p>
<p>Answer: We cannot provide a specific timeframe or velocity; however our best estimate at this point is 3 years.</p>
<p>Question (11): What is the final condition for the units slated for disposal? Are they to be reused by some other entity or destroyed as part of the disposal?</p>
<p>Answer: The final determination for disposal of units will be on a per unit basis. No additional Information is available at this time.</p>
<p>Question (12): For the three THSSs with an eventual inventory of 4,000 - is there an anticipated breakdown for the inventory between the three locations (numbers or percentages)?</p>
<p>Answer: It has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>Question (13): In the Market Research Survey - <br />(a) Question #3 under Contract Performance and Execution - could you restate or clarify this question?</p>
<p>Answer: The intent of Question #3 is to seek industry input on customary industry business practices and processes for performing services in a non-disaster and disaster specific situation.</p>
<p>(b) Is the industry standard question in relation to the type of contract anticipated?</p>
<p>Answer: Contractors are encouraged to recommend a contract type and provide rationale to support the recommendation and to site examples <br />(Disaster &amp; Non Disaster) consistent with demonstrated industry business practices.</p>
<p>Question (14): Will the government continue to pay the leases and utility charges on the staging areas or will that burden shift to the contractor?</p>
<p>Answer: Within this offering, that burden will not shift to the contractor.</p>
<p>Question (15): Will the refurbishments be done in multiple locations or one central location?<br /><br />Answer: At this point it has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>Question (16): Will there be manufacturer support in the refurbishing efforts?</p>
<p>Answer: Not at this time.<br /><br />Question (17): What specifically is required when referring to warehousing support/material handling?</p>
<p>Answer: Duties and skills such as receipt, storage, movement, distribution and disposal of trailers, trailer components and general inventory items.<br /><br />Question (18): APO support services - Will they have FEMA support people on the ground or will they give the contractors access to the LIMS system?</p>
<p>Answer: Any contractor APO support will be executed under the direct supervision of a Government certified APO.</p>
<p>Question (19): Will we need to give FEMA personnel access to our proprietary software platform?</p>
<p>Answer: It is not anticipated that FEMA personnel will require access to the contractor's proprietary system.<br /><br />Question (20): Is data self contained or required to interface with other systems?<br /><br />Answer: At this point, FEMA has not made that determination.</p>
<p>Question (21): How / what data currently exists on units and would we be provided access to that information or do we have to independently acquire data?</p>
<p>Answer: Additional information (breakdown) of existing units will be provided at the Industry Day.<br /><br />Question (22): They specify reports. Do we create them or will the frequency and data be dictated?</p>
<p>Answer: FEMA has not determined reporting requirements; however we will require no less than monthly activity reports.<br /><br />Question (23): What are the data availability requirements to FEMA?</p>
<p>Answer: FEMA has not determined reporting requirements; however we will require no less than monthly activity reports.</p>
<p>Question (24): Is there an expected loss rate of the units, income rates for new systems, rate percentage of incoming units to be refurbished?</p>
<p>Answer: FEMA will retain operational management at each site. We do not understand why this information is necessary for an RFI response.<br /><br />Question (25): Regarding data retention, how long is the data to be maintained?</p>
<p>Answer: We cannot respond to this question until the type of data is clarified.</p>
<p>Question (26): Ordering support - Will there be FEMA support?</p>
<p>Answer: All ordering functions will be under the direct supervision and support of FEMA.<br /><br />Question (27): Will we need to adhere to the Davis Bacon U.S. Dept of Labor pay scale with benefits?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, the Department of Labor Wage Rate Determination will be applicable to any resulting contract. This is not a construction requirement.<br /><br />Question (28): In the event of a disaster, is the contractor responsible to sending a support unit to the forward staging yard, and if so, would that be at cost plus?</p>
<p>Answer: This type of support would be in the scope of the contract, however surge related activities will be handled as Time and Materials.<br /><br />Question (29): Where does the responsibility of this contract end in the event of a disaster?</p>
<p>Answer: The construct of this contract is to complement FEMA disaster response. The responsibility of the contractor will be detailed in the contract.<br /><br />Question (30): What will the transition be from the staging facility to the IA-TAC?<br /><br />Answer: At this juncture, the FEMA logistics responsibility ends with the delivery of units to the disaster. This process is under review and may change.</p>
<p>Question (31): Will we be responsible for the transportation of the THU's to the disaster sites? Or will that be a function of the IA-TAC's?</p>
<p>Answer: This action will not be considered until a contract award decision is made by FEMA. <br /><br />Question (32): Can we review the current FEMA personnel who are providing support at the staging areas and select those we wish to integrate into the on-site team?<br /><br />Answer: This is an ethics/conflict of interest related question. (Contracting)</p>
<p>Question (33): Over what period would we be expected to transition all sites into our system?</p>
<p>Answer: At this point we estimate 15-30 Days.<br /><br />Question (34): Can we have direct communications with the manufacturers from the staging areas or do we have to go through the COTR?</p>
<p>Answer: This is a post-award operational issue that will need to be coordinated through the COTR and Program office.<br /><br />Question (35): Will all manufacturers provide a PDI support team at each staging area as the units arrive?<br /><br />Answer: Pre-Delivery Inspection processes have not been determined at this point.</p>
<p>Question (36): Can our custom Inventory management software integrate into FEMA's LIMS program?<br /><br />Answer: There is no custom inventory management requirement to this offering.</p>
<p>Question (37): Can contractor acquire and/or lease the storage sites from land owners?<br /><br />Answer: For the duration of this contract, it is not anticipated that the contractor will need to do this.</p>
<p>Question (38): Can contractor also provide THU's in addition to managing sites in order to completely privatize the industry?<br /><br />Answer: Privatization of the THU program is not an outcome sought from this offering.</p>

<DESC>Modification: The original synopsis dated 10/22/2008 is modified to reflect a change from intent to award sole source to Bio-Rad Laboratories to a combined synopsis/solicitation for purchase of a Bio-Rad CFX384 Real-Time PCR Detection System.  The Request for Quotation - DL836393 - is issued as Small Business Set-Aside/Brand Name Only.  Brand name only for  Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA 94547.  The Brand Name only justification is based on the following system features/requirements:  The system will be used for PCR assays for measuring telomere lenghts.  The assays use Tm-shifted primers that allow NIEHS to quantify telomere DNA relative to a single copy gene in a single tube SYBER assay at two temperatures.  The specific design parameters of the system are as follows: 1) thermal gradient option of 24 degrees, 2) thermal block accuracy of 0.2 degrees with uniformity of 0.4 degrees within 10 seconds of reaching 90 degrees, 3) optical system for excitation and detection of up to 5 fluorescent types in a single well, 4) independent illumination and detection from each well using filtered LEDs for 9and 6 filtered photodiodes for detection, 5) dedicated channel for FRET experiments, 6) 96 channel reads in 12 seconds, 7) linear dynamic range of 10 orders of magnitude, 8) detects single copy target sequence of genomic DNA, 9) detection of <+ 10 fmol of fluorescein, and 10) can be upgraded to 384 well format.  See attached RFQ # DL836393.  For any questions regarding this announcement, please contact Dee Lunney via email lunney@niehs.nih.gov.*****

2.	INTRODUCTION TO PIH AND PASS

The Department of Housing and Urban (HUD), Office of Public and Indian Housing (PIH), is seeking a contractor to provide development, maintenance and operational support services for its Physical Assessment Sub-System (PASS).

The Department of Housing and Urban (HUD), Office of Public and Indian Housing (PIH), oversees the Real Estate Assessment Center (REAC), which is responsible for capturing, standardizing, improving and evaluating data arising from the portfolio of properties for which HUD has a financial interest or statutory obligation to monitor.  PIH-REAC assesses the physical and financial condition, resident satisfaction, management operations, quality assurance, and other information originating from the following major components of HUDs program participant base:

	Public Housing Agencies (PHAs)
	Multi-Family (MF) Housing properties

The PIH-REAC is responsible for capturing, standardizing, improving, and evaluating data from the portfolio of properties for which HUD has a financial interest or statutory obligation to monitor.  The REAC assesses the following areas: 1) physical condition, 2) financial condition, 3) management capability, and 4) tenant satisfaction surveys Public Housing and Housing Multifamily properties.  The Physical Assessment Sub-system provides the means to assess the physical condition of properties in the HUD portfolio.  PASS is the cornerstone of the PIH-REAC suite of products and is the largest most complex subsystem in the inventory.

The key business functions supported by PASS include: (1) the collection of profile data for all public housing and multifamily properties for which HUD has a statutory obligation or a financial interest, and (2) the inspection of these properties which provides the capability to assess their physical condition.  The need for these business functions surfaced to assist in improving the quality of property conditions and achieve HUDs mandate

The Physical Assessment Subsystem (PASS) collects data and reports the actual state of repair and habitability of the real property.  The inspection observations are recorded on a hand-held computer using HUD developed and HUD owned software and sent electronically to PIH-REAC for scoring, analysis, and processing.

4.	DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS

4.1	Established Development Workload

PASS is currently being re-engineered from the current Cold Fusion environment to leverage Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE).  J2EE defines the standard for developing multi-tier enterprise applications. The J2EE platform makes enterprise applications development easier by establishing them on standardized, modular components, by providing a complete set of services to those components, and by handling many details of application activities automatically. 

The J2EE platform leverages many features of the Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition (J2SE), such as "Write Once, Run Anywhere" portability, JDBC API for database access, technology for interaction with existing enterprise resources, and a security model that protects data even in internet applications. Building on this base, the Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition adds full support for Enterprise JavaBeans components, Java Servlets API, JavaServer Pages and XML technology.

The Physical Assessment Sub-System does not currently have a dynamic interface with other Major Application systems, but is reliant on batch data transfers from other systems such as NASS, REMS and other REAC systems, as well as furnishing batch data to other HUD systems.

End users can access the PASS Information Center through the Internet or by using HUDs Intranet.  Access to The Physical Assessment Sub-System is secured and requires a user ID and password, which are granted on an as needed basis by the security administrator.  If permission is granted, security administrators will provide the end users with very specific access only to relevant sub-modules within the system.

4.2	Future Development Workload

For future development work the offeror must experience providing design and development services for complex and large-scale information technology systems in a Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE) supporting Enterprise JavaBeans components, Java Servlets API, Java Server Pages and XML technology on a Oracle environment. Future work will include but is not limited to the following PASS business modules.

6.	CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS 
The Contractor shall perform all development and maintenance activities in accordance with PIH-REACs Configuration Management Plan.  The plan, which may be found at http://hudatwork.hud.gov/po/reac/products/DCG/docs_guide.cfm, addresses several topics including the following:
Configuration Management:  Configuration management is a set of processes to identify configuration items, baseline configuration items and control changes to that configuration baseline.  
Change Management:  Change management identifies and defines steps for initiating a Software Change Request (SCR) that may alter the existing Software Configuration Items (SCI).  
Change Requests (CR) and Problem Reports (PR): Primary mechanism to initiate a change to the existing requirements or report a problem occurring in the system.
Release Management:  Release management consists of specific processes that manage the risks associated with each of the four PIH release categories:  major releases, feature releases, defect releases and emergency releases.  
Problem Tracking:  SCRs, CRs and PRs are submitted to the CCB for evaluation and approval.  Upon CCB approval, the subsystem that submitted the SCR, CR or PR provides an assessment package for the appropriate release.   
7.	REPORTING OR OTHER PROGRESS/COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS

The project has various reporting requirements including weekly status reports, monthly status reports, and the reporting of all problems, flaws and deficiencies.

The contractor is responsible for submitting various plans including a Project Management Plan (PMP), Transition Plan, Risk Management Plan, Quality Assurance/Quality Control Plan, and System Security Plan.  The contractor is also required to comply with the Earned Value Management processes.

The PMP consists of 4 parts:
	Project Plan;
	Transition Plan;
	Risk Management Plan; and
	Quality Assurance/Quality Control Plan.

The Project Plan shall include a narrative that:
a.	Describes the staffing resources allocated to each task; and
b.	Provides the rationale for the project organization, staff utilization and other resources allocated to each task or activity.

Contractor shall use Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) categories that breakdown work packages into activities of 80 to 100 hours of effort.  Each activity will result in a milestone associated with a particular deliverable.  

The Risk Management Plan shall:
a.	Describe each individual risk to include the source of the risk and the trigger (or symptom) of the risk;
b.	Determine the impact of the risk in terms of cost and schedule;
c.	Document procedures to manage the risk; and
d.	Assign responsibility for risk monitoring and contingency plan implementation to those identified at the PMR or Risk Management planning session.

The Quality Control Plan shall:
a.	Identify the Contractors standards that are applicable to this effort;
b.	Include procedures for complying with those standards;
c.	Identify techniques and metrics for measuring compliance; and
d.	Include an approach for eliminating the causes of unsatisfactory/unacceptable performance.

With each major release, the system security plan (SSP) should be enhanced and updated to reflect security issues arising out of the new release or that have been identified since the plan was last updated.  The purpose of the SSP is to document all of the security controls that are in place, whether built into the system or managed by personnel who operate the system or use its output.  The SSP must meet the standards set by NIST Special Security Publication 800-18.  

Contractor is required to adhere to the Earned Value Analysis management and reporting procedures as stated in the ANSI 748 Standard.

Box 12211, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709-2211<BR>Description<BR>The use of biometrics as an enabling technology has grown recently due to its success in various military applications.  Biometrics has an important role as an enabling technology in Department of Defense (DoD) mission areas such as intelligence (e.g., tagging, tracking, locating), access control (both physical and logical), and forensics (e.g., latent matching).  In addition, biometrics can be leveraged to support various other missions within DoD to include Identity Management.<BR><BR>The U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL), on behalf of the DoD Biometrics Task Force, is currently seeking proposals through its Broad Agency Announcement W911NF-07-R-0001, Topic 2.63, added via Amendment 02, found at http://www.arl.army.mil/www/DownloadedInternetPages/CurrentPages/DoingBusinesswithARL/research/07-r-0001-02_amendment2.pdf<BR>to develop and transition new methodologies, tools, technologies and techniques that advance the state-of-the-art across the spectrum of the biometrics infrastructure to provide users with new and enhanced capabilities.  ARL solicits proposals focusing on the development and demonstration of functional models and the assessment of biometric functionality across either of the two (2) Focus Areas described below.  Demonstrations and assessments will be performed in coordination with the DoD Biometrics Task Force.  Results should include technical performance measurements and analysis from actual testbeds and laboratory environments.<BR><BR>Research Concentration Areas:  In order to address these challenges, the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL), on behalf of the DoD Biometrics Task Force, is soliciting proposals in the following two (2) areas.

<a href="mailto:barry.sayer@amedd.army.mil">US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity</a>
<DESC>The following questions and answers are provided for Sources Sought Request for Information, W81XWH9R12497.  Submission instructions for responses to this RFI are provided below.  The Submission date is changed to 05 December 2008.  The orginal RFI was posted in the FedBizOpps on 05 November 2008.<BR><BR>1.	We did receive a document titled IRD Process Decision Points and Process Steps from Initiation to Investment Decision.   Does this refer to the Independent Research & Development process, or does it refer to the Integrated Requirements Design framework? Is this RFI W81XWH9R12497 linked to an IRD process? If so, how?<BR>	The   IRD Process Decision Points and Process Steps from Initiation to Investment Decision   describes the Integrated Requirements Design framework.  The document was provided to show how investment decisions are made by the MHS to assist the respondent in making recommendations for an acquisition strategy within the limitations of the MHS. See RFI Technical Solution #7.  <BR>2.	Regarding Item 2: we currently have a DD572 we have been using to develop an SBIR project based in the Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio.  Is this the same one the RFI W81XWH9R12497 makes reference to?<BR>	Yes.<BR>3.	Was this solicitation prepared with a particular vendor in mind?<BR>	No.  The intent of the RFI is to solicit information from industry on what is available in the market.  No particular vendor is being sought out.  <BR>4.	Could you be more specific as to what you are seeking in response to Question 2 or is the DoD simply looking for a high-level response?<BR>	DoD is looking for a high level response.  <BR>5.	Given the relative importance of the selection of a blood management system, would the DoD like to require the submission of financial statements from the participating vendors, along with a record of installations and references?<BR>	Vendors are free to provide whatever information they would like as long as it conforms to the submission requirements, i.e. page limitations and font size.  <BR>6.	Please provide a list of the manufacturers/models of the manual and automated data entry test equipment deployed in DoD clinical laboratories that require support.<BR>	DoD clinical laboratory devices are not in scope for this effort. The following table lists the blood management test equipment within the scope of this RFI. <BR><BR>Manufacturer   -   Instrument     -   Assays<BR>a. Immucor - Galileo ECHO  ABO/rh, Antibody Screens, DAT, Crossmatch<BR>b. Immucor - Galileo - ABO/Rh, Antibody Screen, CMV, Syphilis, Weak D, DAT, Crossmatch<BR>c.

Ortho  Provue - ABO/Rh, DAT, Weak D, Antibody Screen, Crossmatch<BR><BR>7.	Will the solution require functionality/capability to manage tissue banking, stem cell or cord blood banking?<BR>Management of these functions/capabilities is NOT within the scope of this RFI.<BR>8.	Will the solution include functionality/capability to support nurse/phlebotomy bedside collect/transfuse workflow?  If so, what requirements are needed?  If not will integration with a third party solution be required?<BR>The solution must support transfusion workflow but not bedside collection workflow. The requirements are to capture the transfusion event details from request to completion, to include reaction if it occurs. Integration with a third party solution should be discussed in the response if relevant to approach. <BR>9.	Will validation services be required as part of the pre-deployment implementation services or will the DoD contract separately for these services?<BR>Yes<BR>10.	What is meant by automated lot release functionality?  Lot release for products?  Lot release for reagents?<BR>The proposed solution should screen against the minimum FDA requirements for lot release of products but not reagents. <BR>11.	With regard to question 1-F:   How the solutions would support data sharing with organizations outside of the DoD (VA, Managed Care Support Contractors, Civilian counterparts)?   Can you specify exactly what data elements are expected to be sent to these other systems?<BR>For transfusion services, the solution must share certain data elements of the SF-518 (Blood or Blood Component Transfusion) with the MHS Clinical Data Repository (CDR) for all transfusion requests and administrations. <BR>For donor processing the solution must share the data elements necessary to support the American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) National Biovigilance Program with non-DoD organizations. <BR>12.	Regarding the document   IRD Process Decision Points and Process Steps from Initiation to Investment Decision   that was sent with the Executive Summary Template, SF518, and Blood Diagram, we were not sure how this pertains to the RFI, or if we were intended to receive a different document.  Can you please clarify how this document pertains to the RFI?<BR>See response to question #1. <BR>13.	Can you provide us with an acronym dictionary?<BR>The majority of acronyms were spelled out in the RFI however, Defense Blood Standard System (DBSS) and   ABBP   was not defined. The acronym   ABBP   is a typographical error. It should say   ASBP   which is defined in the RFI. If vendors require clarification for additional acronyms not used in the RFI, please contact the RFI Point of Contact.  <BR>14.	Is it the intent of this RFI to indicate that the Defense Blood Standards System (DBSS) or future releases of DBSS do not meet the needs of the MHS?<BR>	The intent of the RFI is to solicit information from industry on what is available in the market.   <BR>15.	The solicitation states   Contractors supporting the DoD team will review materials submitted in response to this RFI  .  Are any of these contractors from organizations that are involved with the development, implementation, marketing or sales of computer systems for blood?  Have these contractors signed NDAs? <BR>	All contractors supporting the review of this RFI response are Category 1 or 2 vendors who have signed Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and are excluded from bidding on work related to this RFI. <BR>16.	The solicitation states   &a solution that supports the full spectrum from donor registration, and transfusion is required as well as an ability to share   appropriate information   between individual centers to include the ability to create a look back (i.e., blood product traceability) across all centers and MHS use of the blood management system.    Can you please define appropriate information?  Is this information limited to look backs?<BR>  Appropriate information   is defined as a registry of person or blood product data to support donor deferrals across donor centers and product data to support look back respectively.  <BR>17.	The solicitation states   This global repository does not need to be part of individual center or software activity, but any solution must have the ability to share information in standard formats to other MHS IT systems.    Can you please clarify what the intent of the statement that   This global repository does not need to be part of individual center or software activity  .  Since look backs would be conducted by the centers and presumably using automated systems how would it be possible for this repository not be part of individual center or software activity.  <BR>The solution at individual sites and remote theater operations must be able to share information globally.  This can be achieved by using either a central repository or sharing data between centers as needed.<BR>18.	Can you provide information on the standard formats referenced for sharing information with other MHS IT systems.  Also, can you please list the other MHS systems to which the repository would have to connect.<BR>The standard format for sharing data with other MHS IT systems is Health Level 7 (HL7) messaging. The MHS IT systems the blood solution would have to share certain transfusion, training and inventory data with are: <BR>"	Theater Medical Data Store (TMDS)<BR>"	Clinical Data Repository (CDR)<BR>"	Composite Health Care System (CHCS)<BR>"	Joint Medical Asset Repository (JMAR)<BR>"	MHS Learning Management System (MHS Learn) <BR>"	CliniComp Essentris"<BR><BR>19.	The solicitation states   &the blood community desires to move toward automated self-screening processes  .  Can you please define the scope of the application considered for donor self-screening?<BR>	At the time of donation, donors are presented with the questions from the DD572 (Blood Donation Record). The MHS is seeking a solution that would automate the screening process using a computer-assisted self-interview (CASI) that is FDA compliant and supports multilingual donors.<BR>20.	With respect to SF 518 the solicitation states   The form is used to supplement the current blood management AIS, because the form has not been completely integrated into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and the hospital Electronic Health Record (EHR).    Is there a requirement to incorporate this form into a solution or could another format containing the same essential information be utilized?<BR>	The same essential information can be utilized.<BR>21.	The solicitation states   In an effort to improve transfusion service efficiency, the documentation of pre-transfusion testing, compatibility testing, and quality control documentation can be recorded within the Blood AIS or LIS.    Is this required or an optional requirement?   Also this statement makes reference to a LIS.  Is a LIS within the scope of this solicitation? <BR>	A LIS is out of scope for this RFI, but we would review this information if it is provided. However, the documentation of pre-transfusion testing, compatibility testing, and quality control documentation must be recorded within the Blood AIS, this is not an optional requirement. <BR>22.	The solicitation states   The Government will only review projects that are in commercial use and have maintained FDA compliance for at least 7 years.    Can you please clarify what is meant by projects?  In the normal course of product life cycles new and improved applications are produced to offer functional and technical advantages and to remain compliant with current federal policies and blood management practice standards.  Would applications that are less than 7 years old but have an FDA clearance be considered as part of an overall solution if they are produced by companies having a significant track record of producing regulated applications related to blood.<BR>	The vendor must be able to demonstrate that the solution proposed, or earlier iteration of the solution proposed, has been FDA 510K certified for at least 7 years.<BR>23.	Under the technical solution, In point a) the question   What IT solutions exist today that meet the needs described   is asked.  The needs described are at a very high level.  Are there more detailed requirements available in order to more precisely define the needs so that a detailed assessment can be done?  If so, please provide a copy to us.<BR>	See response to question #4. <BR>24.	Under the technical solution, Point d) states   Also indicate how the solution would support activities which sporadically will have little or no internet connectivity.    Can you please define the activities referenced here?<BR><BR>	The activities referenced are those unique to the military operations in support of combat aide stations, field hospitals, and shipboard medical operations where donations and transfusions also occur. These operations sporadically have little or no internet connectivity.    <BR>25.	Under the technical solution, for point e) can you please provide information on the legacy data that you would want imported into a new system?<BR>	The legacy data from the current MHS blood management IT solution must be incorporated into the proposed IT solution as computable data to support continuity of operations. The current solution data is in an Oracle database format.<BR>26.	Under the technical solution, for point f) please clarify what is meant by data sharing in this case and the data that you would want to share.<BR>	Refer to response for question #11.<BR>27.	Under the technical solution, could you please define emergency as stated in point h)   How will the solution provide flexibility for emergency operations  ?<BR>	Emergency operations such combat casualty or other mass casualty incidents may require that the MHS use products and processes not fully compliant with FDA standards. How will the proposed solution support this?<BR>28.	Under the technical solution, Point j) refers to a learning management system (LMS).  Do you want a LMS as part of this solution and if so please provide the scope of training to be accommodated by this system.<BR>	It would be optimal if there was an integrated LMS and/or training mode whereby users could navigate the system for training and/or running scenarios without using or otherwise impacting   live   data. <BR>29.	Under the technical solution, Point k), please provide the laboratory equipment from which you would want to have automated data transfer.<BR>	Refer to response for question #6.<BR>30.	Under the technical solution, Point p), would this deferral registry extend to theater sites?<BR>	Yes, when the theater site has connectivity. When the sites are experiencing low or no connectivity, the sites shall be able to query cached databases.<BR>31.	Under the technical solution, Point q), would the look back operation extend to theater sites?<BR>	Yes, when the theater site has connectivity.<BR>32.	In several locations, comparisons to other possible solutions and alternatives are requested.  Is this a request to provide comparisons against solutions offered by other vendors or are a variety of solutions being requested with comparisons between them?<BR>	Each respondent is asked to provide solutions based on their knowledge and experience in the industry to include relationships with other products if, when combined, they meet the requirements. However, this is not a market survey. <BR>33.	Could you please provide copies of all the documents & information listed in the solicitation as being available from the Government POC?<BR>	All Documents have been provided to those who have requested them.  <BR>34.	In item 4 a discussion of cost drivers is requested.  Do you want a cost estimate for the solution?  If so more information will be required to prepare an estimate.  <BR>The Government is interested in factors and/or options that can or will drive the cost of the proposed solution and options for dealing with cost factors. The Government does not require a cost estimate however; a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) to support proposed options would be beneficial.<BR>For item 7 please provide additional information so that an appropriate response can be prepared.<BR>	No additional information is available.   <BR>35.	Are the requirements in theater the same as in permanent locations?  If not can you please describe the differences.<BR>	The requirements as mandated by the FDA apply to both theatre and garrison (permanent locations). However, a solution for theatre must take into consideration that operations must continue as normally as possible during periods of limited or no connectivity. Additionally, in the theater environment, some blood, blood products, and processes not fully compliant with FDA regulations are utilized and must be documented and accounted for appropriately. The solution must support all of this with minimal inconvenience to the user. <BR>36.	How do you envision sites with sporadic internet connectivity accessing a global database?<BR>	We are asking respondents to provide visions based on the constraints of proposed solution(s).<BR>37.	Will the Executive Summary stand alone as an independent document separate and distinct from the RFI? In other words, can we assume that no one will read or review the Executive Summary and never read or review the RFI?<BR>	All information properly submitted under this RFI will be reviewed.  <BR>38.	Does the maximum page number restriction for the RFI include the two pages for the Executive Summary?<BR>	The Executive Summary is limited to 2 pages and is not included in the 30-page limit.  Vendors responses should not exceed 30 pages plus the 2 page Executive Summary.<BR>39.	Was this RFI targeted to small business or is there a preference of any kind for small businesses to respond? <BR>	There are no targets or preferences assigned to this RFI.<BR>40.	Will small businesses receive special or different ranking among responding vendors? <BR>	No. <BR>41.	If we are partnered with a small business entity for government contracting, is it preferable or advantageous in any way for the response come from that small business as opposed to coming from us directly? <BR>Refer to response for questions #40 and #41.<BR>42.	Is it acceptable and/or advantageous for both us and our small business partner to respond to the RFI individually? <BR>Refer to response for questions #40 and #41.  <BR>43.	Is there a special circumstance if a certain number of small businesses respond to the RFI (e.g. a set-aside)?  If yes, does this result in a preferred contracting status for any small business over other non-small businesses? <BR>	Refer to response for questions #40 and #41.<BR>44.

<DESC>REVISION OF POINT OF CONTACT IN SPECIAL NOTICE (W81XWH-09-K-0001):<BR><BR>The US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA), on behalf of the US Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC), has a requirement for advanced packaging in the arena of glass pre-filled syringes. Present day glass pre-filled syringes are not adequate to support the stability of next-generation protein vaccines for stockpiling. They currently contain a silicone oil lubricant that greatly increases protein absorption and aggregation which leads to product instability and decreased shelf-life. The contractor will create a uniform hybrid coating comprised of an optimized combination of their existing technologies. This hybrid coating will act as a protein deterrent as well as a lubricant reducing protein absorption and aggregation. The contractor will also develop analytical tools to evaluate and improve the uniformity of the coatings applied to the inside of glass pre-filled syringes. USAMRAA intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Schott No  rth America, Inc. The intent is to make a sole source award pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a)(1)  only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements and FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), supplies are deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in (A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or (B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. Schott North America possesses significant experience in glass pharmaceutical packaging. They have research expertise in the fundamental understanding of bio-molecule/surface interactions, silicone-free lubrication, and protein deterrent coatings. They are the technology leader in coated pharmaceu  tical packaging for drug stabilization and have extensive analytical tools at their disposal for inspection and quality assurance. They have been granted numerous patents pertinent to this research and are the only manufacturer that has overcome the major technological hurdles required to proceed into an advanced development effort for glass pre-filled syringes. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. No solicitation document exists. Any firm that believes it can provide the stated capability within the established timeframe is invited to submit written notification to the Contracting Officer by way of the Contract Specialist within fifteen calendar days from the date of publication of this notice. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the firm's ability to provide the stated capability within the established timeframe. Information can be sent to the Contract Specialist, Brian Miller at brian.d.miller1@us.army.mil. <BR>No telephone requests will be accepted. Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, USAMRAA will proceed with the sole source contract.<BR>

<DESC>REVISION OF POINT OF CONTACT OF SPECIAL NOTICE (W81XWH-09-K-0002):<BR><BR>The US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA), on behalf of the US Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC), has a requirement for the next generation extension of the Wireless Vital Signs Monitor (WVSM), called the WiMed or Wireless Medical Monitoring System, which will streamline casualty care while providing objective quantitative data records to make life saving decisions. The WVSM acquires and transmits vital signs and trend data from point of injury to the trauma care physicians and attendants while being mounted on the victim. The WiMed is a comprehensive jump forward in critcal care by linking all patient care within the same wireless system and platform. The final phases of development for this system include air worthiness testing and immediate deployment in Iraq. USAMRAA intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Athena ISG/GTXtreme, Inc (dba Athena GTX). Athena GTX is the current provider of the Wireless Vital Signs Monitor an  d has already completed extensive work on the WiMed, including prototypes which have already been funded and tested.
