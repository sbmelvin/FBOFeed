<DESC>NOTICE OF CONTRACT ACTION (NOCA) - The Air Armament Center (AAC), Armament Munitions Directorate (EB),&nbsp;intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the B61 Modification 12 Tailkit Assembly (B61-12 TKA) on or about April 27th, 2012.&nbsp; The objective of the B61-12 TKA program is to develop a tailkit as part of the B61 Life Extension Program (LEP) that will eventually enable consolidation of four previous B61 versions into a single warhead type; therefore, reducing logistical overhead requirements and the number of warhead types in the active/inactive/reserve stockpiles.&nbsp; The Government anticipates the award in the October 2012 timeframe of a Cost-Plus-Incentive-Fee (CPIF) contract for the Engineering and Manufacturing Development Phase 1 (EMD Phase 1).&nbsp; The contract award will include a CPIF priced option for EMD Phase 2, as well as two (2) Firm-Fixed-Price priced options for a B61-12 TKA Refurbishment Technical Data Package and Proposal Preparation for Production Lots 1 and 2.&nbsp; The production phase of the program is not included in the initial source selection.&nbsp; However, during source selection, offerors must provide production lot price goals for tailkits for Lots 1 and 2.&nbsp; Proposals are due (45) forty-five days after RFP release.&nbsp; Foreign participation in this acquisition is prohibited. <br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.&nbsp; Responding firms must have a secret level security clearance and must be export control certified in accordance with DoD 5230.25.&nbsp; A certification is required by U.S. contractors that wish to obtain access to unclassified technical data disclosing military critical technology with military or space application that is under the control of, or in the possession of the U. S. Department of Defense (DoD).&nbsp; Instructions for obtaining classified technical data required to respond to the solicitation will be provided with the RFP release.&nbsp; Export control certification may be obtained through the Defense Logistics Services Center (DLSC), Battle Creek, MI, 49017-3084, telephone 1-877-352-2255, website: http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/documents.asp. <br /><br />This pre-solicitation notice neither constitutes a RFP or an Invitation for Bids (IFB), nor does it restrict the Government in any way to an ultimate acquisition approach.&nbsp; This notice should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose.&nbsp; THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. <br /><br />The Air Armament Center has appointed an Ombudsman to hear concerns from potential offerors relating to this acquisition.&nbsp; The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the Program Director or Contracting Officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.&nbsp; When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.&nbsp; The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.&nbsp; Matters of a routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman but rather the Contracting Officer previously identified.&nbsp; For any other concerns, interested parties may call the Air Armament Center Ombudsman, BGen. David A. Harris, AAC/CV, 101 West D Avenue, Suite 116, Eglin AFB FL 32542-5495, (850) 882-5422.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED ON A LATER DATE.
<p>Background<br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch (OEEB) in the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), is anticipating re-competing a full and open competition contract for support for interdisciplinary studies. A major objective of DCEG is to identify and understand mechanisms of carcinogenesis. Occupational and environmental investigations play an important role in this effort because well-documented, high-level exposures to potential carcinogens occur in the workplace and because environmental exposures can impact a large segment of the population. <br /><br />The fundamental mission of the OEEB is to identify and clarify causes of cancer, with a focus on occupational and environmental exposures. To achieve its goals, OEEB's approach has been to (1) merge epidemiology, quantitative exposure assessment, and biologic and genetic components into multi-disciplinary investigations to identify carcinogens, clarify exposure-response relationships, and enhance our mechanistic understanding of carcinogenesis; (2) conduct investigations to develop and improve methods for exposure assessment and to evaluate and incorporate state-of-the-art biomarker assays into its molecular epidemiology studies; (3) facilitate the development of consortia to efficiently create scientific opportunities that are difficult to achieve in any one study; (4) develop and maintain resources for occupational and environmental epidemiology and exposure assessment; and (5) assist in training the next generation of occupational, environmental, and molecular epidemiologists.<br /><br />The philosophic focus of OEEB is to conduct high-impact epidemiologic studies that integrate quantitative exposure assessment and molecular epidemiology to provide new insights into cancer etiology, chemical carcinogenesis, and mechanisms of action. Approximately twenty-five studies will likely receive support under the contract.</p>
<p>This work is currently being conducted under contract HHSN261200700044C held by Westat, Inc. <br /><br />Project Requirement<br />This support services contract is essential for OEEB to conduct high-impact epidemiologic studies that integrate quantitative exposure assessment and molecular epidemiology to provide new insights into cancer etiology, chemical carcinogenesis, and mechanisms of action. The NCI/OEEB requires the assistance of an organization highly experienced in providing technical support for all phases of occupational and environmental epidemiologic studies, including support for exposure assessment and molecular components, and coordination of activities related to genome-wide association studies (GWAS); and in conducting and simultaneously managing concurrent, multiple, large (including international) epidemiologic investigations of cancer etiology. The contract will establish a mechanism to provide all the services required to conduct a wide variety of domestic and international and field (case-control, cohort, and cross-sectional) studies. <br /><br />Some of the major activities of the contract include:</p>
<p>a. pilot test data collection forms and instruments, including computer-assisted personal (CAPI) and computer-assisted telephone (CATI) interviews; <br />b. train interviewers and abstractors, including development of training documents under guidance of NCI;<br />c. interview study subjects and their family; <br />d. trace study subjects; including locating cancer patients and/or their relatives, selection of controls through such methods as random digit dialing and acquisition of appropriate study population rosters or files (e.g., departments of motor vehicles); <br />e. abstract medical records and other relevant data sources; <br />f. trace to determine vital status or locate subjects; <br />g. obtain death certificates and cancer incidence records; <br />h. obtain medical records; <br />i. select appropriate molecular epidemiology procedures to understand cancer etiology with guidance from NCI; <br />j. edit and maintain quality control and standardization of data to ensure appropriate and valid results; <br />k. arrange for the collection, handling, transport, and storage of biologic, industrial hygiene and environmental samples; <br />l. coordinate and monitor a biologic specimen program; <br />m. prepare data management systems that monitor study progress and data flow;<br />n. assess occupational and environmental exposures using various techniques, including (for the environmental assessment) geographic information systems;<br />o. develop and monitor subcontracts; <br />p. conduct coding of records, questionnaires and death certificates; <br />q. prepare and maintain computer databases;<br />r. provide documentation of study decisions and study procedure manuals; <br />s. identify qualified industrial hygienists and exposure assessors; <br />t. identify qualified laboratories to analyze biologic, industrial hygiene and environmental samples; <br />u. develop files and reports of work to allow efficient and easy transfer of data and knowledge to the next support services contractor;<br />v. develop coordination and liaison at the local or international level with collaborating investigators or institutions whose cooperation is needed for the conduct of a study<br />w. close coordination of GWAS efforts with the relevant NCI repositories and laboratories, including trouble shooting all aspects of data and DNA sample preparation; prepare and maintain subject data logs and DNA manifests; selection of DNA samples for analysis based on review of pre-genotyping quality control reports; coordination of the post-GWAS replication efforts including selecting DNA samples for analysis; coordinating data collection and harmonization across studies for subsequent gene-environment interaction analyses; and preparation and QC/QA of phenotype data linked to GWAS data sets for submission to dbGaP.</p>
<p>The services will be acquired through full and open competitive procedures under NAICS 541990. It is anticipated that a cost reimbursement, term type contract will be awarded with a 1-year base period and four (4) 1-year options of performance beginning on or about September 28, 2012.</p>
<p>The RFP will be available electronically on or about April 26, 2012 and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps at www.fbo.gov. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.<br />Closing date and time for receipt of offers is March 12, 2012 at 10:00 a.m., EST. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the Agency. Anticipated award date is on or about April 2, 2012.

<DESC>The Air Force is seeking sources for a potential 100 percent set-aside for HUBZone, EDWOSB, or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) concerns. IF ADEQUATE RESPONSES ARE NOT RECEIVED, THE ACQUISTION MAY BE SOLICITED ON AN UNRESTRICTED BASIS. This is a sources sought for planning purposes only. This project replaces approximately 10,000 linear feet of 21 to 27 inch gravity sanitary sewer from west of Gate 1B along Springfield Street to a manhole in the center of Smithville Road. The pipeline crosses under the Harshman Road overpass, runs through Yorktown Colony Apartments, and follows an abandoned railroad line through the East Gardendale Plat in the City of Riverside. Work includes installing sanitary sewer main using open cut, jack and boring, and pipe bursting methods; by-passing sanitary flows equal to or greater than 2.0 million gallons per day in an active sanitary main with no disruption to sanitary service; replacing sanitary pipe through an active roadway with no road closures to include off-ramps, main intersections and general vehicle traffic; coordinating with multiple government agencies; and constructing sewer pipe through the following types of property: residential, multi-residential complexes, and commercial.
<p>Special Requirements/Concerns: Restrictive easement boundaries through private properties outside base boundaries. The line traverses through an apartment complex creating restrictive safety considerations. The line is under Springfield Street at the Harshman Road by-pass. This will require micro tunneling and bore and jack procedures to avert surface disruptions. In addition, there are line traverses near many private company utility lines that will have to be accounted for and avoided. This will require an experienced contractor to keep sewage flow operational for over half of Area B and all of Area A (Patterson Field). Failure in this project could result in shutdown of WPAFB operations, environmental contamination and resultant fines and penalties, and widespread power/water/sewer outages off base.</p>
<p>The Air Force intends to award a contract with a 300 day period of performance.</p>
<p>The estimated magnitude of the entire contract is between $1,000,000.00 and $5,000,000.00</p>
<p>NAICS Code : 237110 Size Standard: $33.5M.</p>
<p>Prime contractors who are HUBZone, EDWOSB or SDVOSB and who intend to submit a bid for this solicitation are highly encouraged to submit the following by 3:00 p.m. (local Dayton time) on 19 APRIL 2012:</p>

<p>Firms interested should provide the above documentation. Fax or e-mail responses will be accepted. All of the above must be submitted in sufficient detail for a decision to be made on the availability of interested HUBZone, EDWOSB, or SDVOSB concerns. Responses shall be limited to 5 pages. Please include your DUNS Number or CAGE Code on your response. Failure to submit all information requested would result in a contractor being considered "non-responsive" in this requirement.

No entitlements to payment of direct or indirect cost or charges to the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses or the Government's use of such information. The information obtained from industries responses to this notice may be used in the development of an acquisition strategy and future RFP.</p>

<DESC>The US Army is surveying the marketplace to determine the availability of additional tire sources or tire/rim sources for the M1000 Heavy Equipment Transporter System (HETS) trailer. The M1000 is used to transport the M1 Series Main Battle Tank during operation. The M1000 contains ten axles each having four tires, for a total of 40 tires per trailer (plus 2 spares). Maximum trailer payload is 140,000 lbs. Tire load at maximum payload is up to 3850 lbs. Testing and qualification are planned to be conducted in accordance with Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) J2014 and ATPD 2130D specification and funded by the Government. The Government is conducting an analysis of alternatives using three different scenarios for additional sources, each with an increasing logistical impact. The first scenario is evaluating a tire in the same size as the M1000 as currently configured (215/75R17.5). The second scenario involves evaluating tire in a different size, but acceptable for use on the existing approved rim (Accuride p/n 28112 17.5X6.75HC). The third scenario involves evaluating tires and wheels in a different size. If responding to third scenario, please include both tire and wheel information. Information provided by vendors will be used by the Government for analysis and requirements development.

<DESC>Superhydrophobicity and superoleophobicity (or Omniphobicity) have been demonstrated in the labs for many years; however, omniphobic treated surfaces can easily be compromised with slight scratching and abrasion.  The purpose of this effort is to assess the current state of the art in research, development, and engineering for durable omniphobic (i.e., superhydrophobic and superoleophobic) coatings for potential applications in military clothing.  <br><br>It is expected that durable omniphobic treated textiles will provide increased environmental protection (against i.e., rain, water, and snow) as compared to conventionally available durable water repellant treated textiles and minimized attractions to aerosols, dusts, and dirt contaminants (thus reducing logistical burden with less frequent laundering).  In addition, it is envisioned that omniphobic treated protective clothing will help to protect the skin from contact with solid and liquid toxic industrial chemicals, petroleum, oil, and lubricants, chemical warfare agents, and bacteria and viruses, thus effectively providing enhanced chemical/biological (CB) protection. <br><br>A series of tests (as presented in the attached Table 1, "Material Performance for Omniphobic Treated Fabrics" ) will be conducted to assess omniphobic coatings submitted/responded to this solicitation to ensure a minimal impact to the textile's physical properties and performance characteristics, and the resulting omniphobic treatment is compatible for use in textile applications.  <br><br>These omniphobic coated/treated fabrics will resist attractions by liquid chemicals and aerosols by having very low surface tensions (i.e., very high liquid contact angle), while they are durable - having high abrasion resistance, good tensile strength, minimally hindering air permeability and moisture vapor transport properties.  The weights add on after the omniphobic coating treatment process should be minimal.  The coating should be thin, and conformal to the textile fibers.  The fabric should remain flexible and dimensionally stable -i.e., the omniphobic coating process should not increase the stiffness of the fabric or shrink in any directions.  The treatment process should not affect the fabric's print (color) negatively. <br><br>Feedback will be provided after NSRDEC's testing and evaluation to academic institutions and industries which submit omniphobic textile products and technical data.  Informal communications (in-person meetings, emails, and telephones) with NSRDEC Principle Investigator are expected to discuss technical findings.  Limited future procurements and potential collaborations will be discussed, and the course of actions for successful omniphobic coating technologies that satisfied performance goals established in Table 1 will be recommended and integrated into follow-on science, technology, and acquisition programs with the aim to develop and transition advanced and novel technologies to benefit the Soldiers. <br><br>Please submit omniphobic treated materials and technical data to:  Quoc Truong, US Army Natick Soldier Research, Development, and Engineering Center, Warrior Science, Technology, and Applied Research Directorate, ATTN: RDNS-WSC-C, 15 Kansas Street, Natick, MA 01760.<br>

In 2009, drug poisoning became the leading cause of injury death in the United States. Overdoses of prescription drugs, especially prescription painkillers are now more common than deaths from heroin and cocaine combined. In an effort to continue to address this rising problem, CDC must research and understand prescription drug use at the originating source, prescribers.<br /><br />The potential project seeks to extract customized data from the NPA Database.

In addition, the data set will contain cost information, allowing CDC to further explore economic consequences associated with the epidemic of prescription drug overdoses.<br /><br />The vendor will be required to deliver the most current 72 months national level data and most current 48 months state level data of specific prescription drugs. The following variable data characteristics must be included:<br /><br />&bull; Dispensed Prescriptions (New, Total) in the Retail Channel (Chain, Independent, Food, Mass Merchandise)<br />&bull; Extended Units (New, Total)<br />&bull; Average Prescription Size (New, Refill, Total)<br />&bull; Dollars Per New/Refill/Total Prescription (Pharmacy Cost, Retail Price)<br />&bull; Method Of Payment (Cash, Medicaid, Third Party)<br />&bull; Prescription Substitutions If Available<br />&bull; Therapy Days<br />&bull; Days Supply<br />&bull; Patient Price<br /><br />The vendor will also be required to modify data collection for the defined data sets on a quarterly basis for a one year period based on CDC analysis and recommendations.<br /><br />The anticipated period of performance is 12 months.<br /><br />The vendor must demonstrate capacity and past experience in providing such data.

However, if responsible sources believe there is a different code that can work better for this requirement, they can recommend the code to the Contracting Officer with an explanation of why they feel the code is more appropriate.

<DESC>ANG PARARESCUMAN (GUARDIAN ANGEL) GAO KIT TRAINING
<p>The purpose of this effort is to provide Guardian Angel (GA) personnel proper training with newly procured equipment that enhances their situational awareness which consists of communication gear, VDL systems, tactical mini computers, and data link equipment. Once the GAs are taught their newly procured equipment they will need to test their newly acquired proficiency in a tactical exercise. All these systems integrated together properly provide GA personnel with real time situational awareness while trying to rescue personnel during peace and wartime. These systems together make up the bulk of the GAO kit. Each GA operator will need in depth instructions of proper procedures of the configuration of radios, VDL equipment, and software settings in the mini computers.</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE
<p>THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY (NIST) TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE</p>
<p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) under NAICS code, 541990, that have the capability, experience, and expert knowledge in the area of performing editing services for a scientific database.</p>
<p>The specific database associated with this procurement is populated with Ceramic Phase Equilibrium Data. Our objective is to compile, evaluate, determine, and disseminate phase equilibrium data to facilitate and optimize the development, processing, and usage of advanced ceramic materials. By delineating the conditions (chemical composition, temperature, pressure, and atmosphere) under which pure compounds and their mixtures occur, phase equilibrium data provide essential thermochemical guidance for the technical exploitation of ceramic materials.</p>
<p>Technical Editing Services for SRD 31 (Phase Equilibria Diagrams)</p>
<p>I. BACKGROUND<br />The American Ceramic Society (ACerS) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) hold joint copyright to the database Phase Equilibria Diagrams* (Standard Reference Database 31 (SRD 31)). This project originated in 1933 as an ACerS-NIST (then NBS) partnership. The contents of this database consist of equilibrium phase diagrams, or processing maps, for ceramic materials. <br /><br />Phase equilibrium data are used throughout the ceramics industry to understand and control the complex phenomena that underlie the production and performance of advanced materials. Phase diagrams serve as maps of the equilibrium chemical and structural behaviors exhibited by materials and provide critical starting information for the rational design of materials processing schemes, quality assurance efforts, and optimization of the physical and chemical properties of advanced materials. The Phase Equilibria Diagrams* series (SRD 31) provides critical written commentaries, evaluated graphical representations, bibliographic data, and analytical capabilities. The published portion of the database now includes over 21,000 phase diagrams contained in 24 books and a CD-ROM. Activities in the Ceramics Division Data Center include continuous addition of new database content (about 1,000 new diagrams per year), dissemination of the data in printed and digital formats, and development of scientific software to facilitate access to and use of the data.</p>
<p>II. PURPOSE</p>
<p>The purpose of this requirement is to provide the full range of technical editing services needed to produce new content for SRD 31, Phase Equilibria Diagrams* (PED). New database entries are called PED Figures, each consisting of critical-evaluation commentary text and one or more phase diagrams. The information for new PED Figures is extracted from original scientific literature (including foreign-language publications), critically evaluated by scientists with advanced education and expertise in ceramic science (see section IX), and prepared for publication by editors that are not available within the government.</p>
<p>III. SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide professional/scientific editing services needed to prepare new content; i.e., new PED Figures, for publication in SRD 31. The editing workflow begins with searching the original literature, retrieving and classifying new content, preparation of critical commentaries and evaluated diagrams, ensuring that commentaries and diagrams conform to the guidelines (Attachment 1), graphical digitization of new diagrams, entering new content in the content management system (CMS), and finally, formatting new content for publication.</p>
<p>The following categories of editing services are required to accomplish and manage the workflow:</p>
<p>Literature Editor - identify recently published scientific papers with new content for the database<br />Contributing Editors - prepare new PED Figures consisting of commentaries with critical evaluations of published scientific articles written in both English and foreign languages (e.g., Chinese, Russian, German, Japanese, French, Polish) and edited/corrected diagrams (guidelines and sample given in Attachment 1)</p>
<p>General Editors - edit the work of the Contributing Editors - ensure that commentaries and phase diagrams conform with guidelines (Attachment 1)</p>

<DESC>INVITATION FOR OFFERFEDERAL GAS FROM CLIFFSIDE HELIUM ENRICHMENT UNIT IFO No. BLM-CHEU-001April 2012  March 2013
Introduction
The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) of the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) is requesting written offers from pre-qualified companies (see Pre-Qualification and Credit Requirements) to purchase Federal gas produced from the Bureau of Land Managements (BLM) Cliffside Helium Enrichment Unit (CHEU).  The BLMs CHEU is located in Potter County, Texas near the city of Amarillo. 
Production from the CHEU is delivered into El Paso Natural Gas (El Paso) natural gas transmission system via El Pasos Cliffside lateral line.  The BLM has contracted with El Paso for firm transportation over this lateral.  This firm contract includes access to interconnects with Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL) and El Paso Natural Gas (El Paso), also located in Potter County, Texas.   
Please note that we are selling all of this gas under a swing obligation on the daily market rather than using a baseload and swing component.   The CHEU volume may increase or decrease through the term of this sale although BLM anticipates relatively stable production rates.  To acquire the full details for applying go to:  http://www.blm.gov/nm/amarillo

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE
TEMPORARY CONTRACT

Network Contracting Office 9 (NCO 9) has a requirement to contract for Gastroenterology services for the VA Medical Center located in Memphis, Tennessee.  This is a continuing requirement and is based on an urgent need to ensure continuity of essential medical services.  

SCOPE:  The VA anticipates the award of a multiple award contract for Gastroenterology Services, on an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity basis from this solicitation.  The solicitation will be conducted in accordance with Department of Veterans Affairs Acquisition Regulation (VAAR) Part 873 with the procurement conducted using FAR parts 12 and 15.

DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES PROVIDED:  
a. 	The Contractor(s) shall provide Colonoscopy Services for the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VA/VAMC), 1030 Jefferson Avenue, Memphis, TN in accordance with the requirements of this contract. Colonoscopy is an integral aspect of the care of veteran patients. It may be indicated as a simple screening or surveillance procedure to determine the presence of colon cancer or polyps; or, to investigate the specific symptoms or signs such as constipation or anemia or hemoccult positive stool. In the past few years, the VA has committed to colon cancer screening for quality care, and has set up performance measures to encourage compliance.

b.  	The current capacity of the Memphis VAMC is far less than the needs of a full colon cancer screening program. VAMC Memphis projects an estimated 3000 patients will require colonoscopy services each year above the current capacity. These patients will be referred to the awarded contractor(s). Multiple contracts may be awarded. The Contractor(s) shall be located within a 100 mile radius of the VA Medical Center, Memphis, TN, providing services in one or more locations as detailed in the Schedule of Services. Contractors do not have to provide an offer for each community / site. Although this may be a multiple award contract, the contractor that receives an award will be the sole recipient for that particular geographic location.

c.  	 Contract bids should be all cost inclusive, including professional fees, facility fees, monitoring and sedation fees, and shipping costs. The contracted price is for completed procedures. A "No Show" patient is defined as failure to keep a scheduled appointment without canceling that appointment at least 48 hours earlier. Notification of patients that "No Show" for procedures will be reported weekly (each Friday) by fax to the attention of GI Clinic (Joyce Young), fax number (901-577-7286), contact phone number (901-523-8990 ext. 6610), preferably in Microsoft excel worksheet format sorted by referring physician name for follow-up by patient's primary care physician for rescheduling if needed

d.	Upon request of the VA the Contractor shall be responsible for providing any or all of the following services: 

"	Contractor shall provide colonoscopies, inclusive of CPT codes 45378-45385 and attendant procedures (CPT 45330), as clinically needed. It is anticipated that all applicable procedures for a given patient will be performed in a single session. Repeat procedures, if indicated, will be cleared and scheduled by the VA as a new session. Repeat sessions include a small number of cases where the prep was poor, or there were too many polyps to remove in one session, or incomplete removal of a polyp warranted repeat examination.

"	All procedures shall be accomplished at an accredited endoscopy facility that has the proper equipment and supplies necessary to safely perform the required services. Accreditation by either the American Association for Accreditation of Ambulatory Surgery Facilities (AAAASF), Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care (Accreditation Association or AAAHC), or the Joint Commission is required, All endoscopes must be cleaned, reprocessed, and stored according to manufacturer's guidelines.

"	All procedures shall be performed by ABIM board-certified gastroenterologists, or board-eligible gastroenterologists with a minimum of one year of endoscopy experience post-training.  

"	Sedation preference will be at the discretion of the contract endoscopist. Options include benzodiazepine plus narcotic versus diprovan alone. All procedures will be performed using accepted clinical standards

"	No outside prescriptions will be necessary. If the contract endoscopist recommends a prescription medication, they must contact Ms. Martha J. Garner at the VA (901-523-8990, ext. 5573) though which the prescription will be administered. 

The Contractor shall provide colonoscopies, inclusive of CPT codes 45378 - 45385 and attendant procedures, as clinically appropriate.
The Memphis VAMC will be responsible for pre-procedure patient education and scheduling, and all post procedure care (except extreme emergencies), including pathology interpretation. VAMC Memphis will also be responsible for subsequent management of any diagnosis requiring follow-up care.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a Firm-Fixed Price Purchase Order, on a sole source basis, with Kipp &amp; Zonen of Bohemia, New York for the purchase of a Pyrheliometer and Pyranometers under other than full and open competition.
<p>NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.</p>
<p>(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in -</p>
<p>(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.</p>
<p>(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).)</p>
<p>Sole Source determination is based on the following: The Kipp &amp; Zonen Pyrheliometer and Pyranometers will be used in conjunction with an existing Kipp &amp; Zonen Outdoor Broadband Radiometric Measurement System already owned by NIST. The Pyrheliometer and Pyranometers will be 100% interchangeable with the existing Kipp &amp; Zonen Outdoor Broadband Radiometric Measurement System currently at NIST. Deviations away from the Kipp &amp; Zonen Pyrheliometer and Pyranometers would cause needless replication of key equipment and accessories, interchangeability issues, and would result in significant duplication of cost to NIST in both hardware and man-hours. Kipp &amp; Zonen is the sole manufacturer and distributor of these instruments. As a result, Kipp &amp; Zonen is uniquely qualified to satisfy the Government's minimum requirements.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractor's commercial schedule.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 12:00 p.m. (EST) on April 18, 2012. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to joshua.holliday@nist.gov. No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION (or SOLE SOURCE)
Background: The National Park Service Inventory and Monitoring (I&M) Program was established to provide robust scientific information regarding the status and trends of critical natural resources in the National Parks. There are 32 multi-park networks in the I&M Program. The Central Alaska Network (CAKN) consists of Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve, Denali National Park and Preserve, and Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve, and covers 22 million acres, or 25% of all land administered by the National Park Service nationwide. In order to track the condition of our parks, Central Alaska Network scientists have chosen 37 key indicators, or "Vital Signs," to represent the overall health of the network. Each Vital Sign falls into one of 4 categories: physical environment, plant life, animal life, or human use. 15 vital signs relate to animal life, 12 relate to the physical environment, 4 relate to human use, and 6 relate to plant life. Underlying these 4 vital sign categories is a focus on habitat change. This focus allows us to predict and possibly model future variations on the landscape. With some idea about predicted change, managers can develop better strategies for resource protection. 
Natural resource monitoring is conducted primarily for two purposes: (1) to detect significant changes in resource abundance, condition, population structure, or ecological processes; or (2) to evaluate the effects of some management action on population or community dynamics or ecological processes. Monitoring data are most useful when the same methods are used to collect data at the same locations over a long time period (e.g. more than 10-12 years). The CAKN Inventory and Monitoring Program is being designed to last for well beyond this time frame.
Three of the CAKN Vital Signs relate directly to rivers and streams, and include water quality, stream and river flow, and the distribution and abundance of freshwater fishes. These three Vital Signs are interrelated and represent different ways of examining change in these important ecosystems. To fully evaluate any of the various aspects of stream ecosystems, how those ecosystems may be changing, and what those changes mean requires an accurate and ongoing appraisal of the water chemistry of the systems (that is, what are the concentrations of various important dissolved compounds such as nutrients). Because the streams of the Central Alaska Network are relatively pristine (unpolluted), the natural levels of many of these compounds are very low. This means that in order to accurately monitor these ecosystems, we must be able to accurately quantify very low concentrations of these compounds. Very few water chemistry vendors are able to repeatably and accurately detect the low levels we require, because highly specialized methodologies are required to attain that level of data quality. The Cooperative Chemical Analytical Laboratory (CCAL) was established by the U.S. Forest Service over 30 years ago specifically to carry out these kinds of specialized analyses. The CAKN flowing waters program and the CAKN shallow lakes program have relied on CCAL to analyze water chemistry samples since 2006.  1.	FAR Statutory Authority cited: 6.302, Circumstances Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition.  Per FAR 6.302-1(B)(1)(i) the  Cooperative Chemical Analytical Laboratory at Oregon State University, 3200 Jefferson Way, Corvallis, OR 97331. is the only laboratory that can provide the services required due to the level of testing needed and continuity in data. 
2.  Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs.

17. Total Dissolved Nitrogen (APHA 4500-NO3 F; APHA 4500-P J., detection limit 0.01 mg/l +/- 0.01 mg/l)
Laboratory specifications:
a. The laboratory must be experienced in the analysis of low-level nutrient concentrations in water samples from oligotrophic systems and meet the detection limits.
b. The laboratory must conform to EPA surface water chemistry criteria.
c. The laboratory must participate in the USGS Standard Reference Water Survey Program.
d. The laboratory must provide a detailed Quality Assurance Plan to CAKN.
e. The laboratory must use prepared NIST-traceable calibration standards.
f. The laboratory must, when sample volume allows, run duplicate analyses for 10% of samples per analysis.
g. The laboratory must be located in Alaska or the Pacific Northwest to minimize transit time for shipment of frozen samples.
3.  A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights etc.).  The Central Alaska Network has selected this laboratory to analyze its water samples because CCAL is capable of detecting extremely low levels of the chemical constituents found in Alaskan waters. Unlike most water chemistry labs, which specialize in the analysis of wastewater or water from polluted locations, CCAL specializes in the analysis of research samples from natural lakes, streams, precipitation and groundwater in unpolluted areas. Our samples are collected in pristine streams with extremely low solute concentrations; as such, we require the low detection limits provided by CCAL. CCAL has more than 30 years experience analyzing these kinds of water samples. CCAL is also capable of dealing with the high concentrations of DOC often found in lakes and streams in Alaska. The highly colored nature of water from these systems can compromise the accuracy of measurements and many labs are not equipped to deal with the required color corrections.CCAL has a well-developed Quality Assurance Plan that insures delivery of precise and accurate results. CCAL laboratory techniques conform to EPA surface water chemistry criteria and CCAL participates in the USGS Standard Reference Water Survey Program, an external interlaboratory QA Program, to monitor the accuracy of analytical procedures. Participation in the USGS Standard Reference Water Survey Program insures that measurements made in different laboratories will be of comparable quality and in principle will be directly comparable. Data produced by CCAL from a standardized set of protocols allow direct comparisons among diverse studies, creating a legacy of data that grows with each new study. This conformity increases the value of data collected by the CAKN flowing waters monitoring program and allows us to compare our data directly with that collected by other monitoring networks. This in turn increases our power to detect environmental change on a regional level.  By standardizing detection and measurement of the chemical and physical properties of water, and by eliminating the need and expense of establishing duplicate facilities, CCAL operations are beneficial to both cooperative and individual research projects. For these reasons CCAL continues to be the least expensive lab operating under a good Quality Assurance Plan capable of measuring the low concentrations that we require. CCAL is also being used for water sample analysis by the CAKN shallow lakes program, as well as by other I&M networks, including the Southwest Alaska Network and the Pacific Northwest Network.
Another important reason we selected CCAL was due to its relatively close proximity to Alaska. The water samples we collect must remain frozen until they are analyzed. It is not feasible to ship samples cross country as we risk the samples thawing and thus compromising the quality of the data. CCAL is located in Oregon and we can easily transport samples to the lab before the samples thaw and begin to degrade. When shipping from remote areas such as Kotzebue or Nome samples often arrive in Oregon partially thawed. It is important we have a lab that is close to Alaska. 
 The success of the CAKN water monitoring program depends upon the ability to detect and quantify subtle changes in natural processes with confidence. CCAL has demonstrated for the past five years that they are capable of providing us with the high quality data we require. 
4.  A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:  
In 2006 a market evaluation was completed of laboratories in Alaska and Pacific-Northwest. We also requested quotes from labs throughout the US. At that time CCAL was identified as the best source. 
5.  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:  
We have been working with CCAL to provide high quality chemical analyses to the network for the past 6 years. Over this time, we have invested a significant amount of staff time, effort and expense (see table below) to insure that we have a high quality dataset. In addition to the time we spent researching labs during 2005-2006, we have since reviewed laboratories each year to insure that CCAL is still the best choice in labs. Additionally we have developed computer script and data importing routines that work directly with data reports produced by CCAL. Changing labs would require reworking these scripts and would slow our data QA/QC process resulting in delays in publishing these data. The network requires data be reported within six months of acquisition, meeting this deadline would be difficult if we had to redevelop our data importing routines. Finally, changing labs would require an extensive QA/QC process to ensure that data provided by the new vendor are compatible with existing data from CCAL, further increasing costs to the Government.

It allows users to send and receive email and calendar updates.  Under authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). Please see the below Justification for other than Full and Open Competition for further details.
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government shall consider all responses received prior to the close date of this announcement. Written responses to this notice shall contain sufficient documentation to establish bonafide capability to fulfill the requirement. A solicitation is not available. Please-mail contract specialist, James Bowers with responses or questions regarding this requirement maybe  submitted via facsimile to James Bowers, at 907-644-3802 or email at James_Bowers@nps.gov   This service will be procured under Firm Fixed Price Commercial in accordance with FAR Part 12 procedures and Other Than Full and Open Competition as authorized under FAR 6.302-1 and FAR 25.103(e). 

GENERAL DESCRIPTION:  Alaska Regional Office requires a software program that allows for iPad user to connect their iPads to the National Park Service Lotus Notes email system requires the installation of a new POS register system with Advantage software that can be used to account and remit for fee collections.
JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION (or SOLE SOURCE)
Background: The Alaska Region currently uses a software and license service called mSuite which was created by CommonTime.  This product allows for iPad user to connect their iPads to the National Park Service Lotus Notes email system.  The original purchase of this software and service was done via a government charge card in order to test the environment.  Now that everything has been fully tested, implementation has come to a point where more User Licenses are required.  
1.  FAR Statutory Authority cited: 6.302, Circumstances Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition.  CommonTime is the creator of this product and the only vendor that sells this product.  It is not available from any other source.
2.  Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs.This product allows for iPad user to connect their iPads to the National Park Service Lotus Notes email system.  It allows users to send and receive email and calendar updates.
3.  A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights etc.).  CommonTime is the creator of this product and the only vendor that sells this product.  It is not available from any other source.
4.  A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:  Since we already have the CommonTime mSuite software installed and server equipment setup, we know that this product works and is already distributed amongst our users.  To go out and try to find another product would take time and financial resources that have already be spent to proof the current CommonTime deployment.  
5.  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:  It is not financially beneficial to research another product when we have a product that already works and we're simply trying to add additional licenses.
6.  A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.  None

The following GAO Disputes clause is listed in full text.
DisputesLegislative Branch Agency (APR 2008)
(a) This contract is subject to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, as amended (41 U.S.C. 601-613), as modified by Section 1501 of Title I of Division H of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-161, 121 Stat. 1844 (2008).
(b) Except as provided in the Act, all disputes arising under or relating to this contract shall be resolved under this clause.
(c) Claim, as used in this clause, means a written demand or written assertion by one of the contracting parties seeking, as a matter of right, the payment of money in a sum certain, the adjustment or interpretation of contract terms, or other relief arising under or relating to this contract. However, a written demand or written assertion by the Contractor seeking the payment of money exceeding $50,000 is not a claim under the Act until certified. A voucher, invoice, or other routine request for payment that is not in dispute when submitted is not a claim under the Act. The submission may be converted to a claim under the Act, by complying with the submission and certification requirements of this clause, if it is disputed either as to liability or amount or is not acted upon in a reasonable time.
(d)(1) A claim by the Contractor shall be made in writing and, unless otherwise stated in this contract, submitted within 6 years after accrual of the claim to the Contracting Officer for a written decision. A claim by the Government against the Contractor shall be subject to a written decision by the Contracting Officer.
(d)(2)(i) The Contractor shall provide the certification specified in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this clause when submitting any claim exceeding $50,000.
(ii) The certification requirement does not apply to issues in controversy that have not been submitted as all or part of a claim.
(iii) The certification shall state as follows: "I certify that the claim is made in good faith; that the supporting data are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief; that the amount requested accurately reflects the contract adjustment for which the Contractor believes the Government is liable; and that I am duly authorized to certify the claim on behalf of the Contractor."
(3) The certification may be executed by any person duly authorized to bind the Contractor with respect to the claim.
(e) For Contractor claims of $50,000 or less, the Contracting Officer must, if requested in writing by the Contractor, render a decision within 60 days of the request. For Contractor-certified claims over $50,000, the Contracting Officer must, within 60 days, decide the claim or notify the Contractor of the date by which the decision will be made.
(f) The Contracting Officer's decision shall be final unless the Contractor appeals, within 90 days of receipt of a contracting officers decision, to the Government Accountability Office Contract Appeals Board, 441 G Street, N.W., Room 7182, Washington, D.C. 20548; Facsimile:  202-512-9749; E-Mail:  CAB@gao.gov.
(g) If the claim by the Contractor is submitted to the Contracting Officer or a claim by the Government is presented to the Contractor, the parties, by mutual consent, may agree to use alternative dispute resolution (ADR). If the Contractor refuses an offer for ADR, the Contractor shall inform the Contracting Officer, in writing, of the Contractor's specific reasons for rejecting the offer.
(h) The Government shall pay interest on the amount found due and unpaid from (1) the date that the Contracting Officer receives the claim (certified, if required); or (2) the date that payment otherwise would be due, if that date is later, until the date of payment. With regard to claims having defective certifications, as defined in FAR, 48 CFR 33.201, interest shall be paid from the date that the Contracting Officer initially receives the claim. Simple interest on claims shall be paid at the rate, fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury as provided in the Act, which is applicable to the period during which the Contracting Officer receives the claim and then at the rate applicable for each 6-month period as fixed by the Treasury Secretary during the pendency of the claim.
(i) The Contractor shall proceed diligently with performance of this contract, pending final resolution of any request for relief, claim, appeal, or action arising under the contract, and comply with any decision of the Contracting Officer.

(End of clause)

Alternate I. As prescribed in 33.215, the contracting officer does substitute the following paragraph (i) for paragraph (i) of the basic clause:

2) it is the only proposal received.  (B) If the proposal, modification or revision was transmitted through electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, such transmission shall be deemed late unless it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government installation not later than the exact time specified for receipt of proposals. (C) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful proposal that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted. (i) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the proposal wrapper, electronic records, and other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.

<p>Addenda to 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>i) Technical Capabilities<br />a. Experience<br />b. Understanding of the Requirement<br />ii) Past Performance<br />iii) Price</p>
<p>Technical Capabilities and its sub factors, are significantly more important than past performance and price. However, as Offeror's ratings for the non-price factors approach equality, price becomes significantly more important in the award decision.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>The Government will award a single Firm Fixed Price contract from this combined synopsis/solicitation. Offerors are cautioned that an award may not necessarily be made to the lowest price offered. The Government is more concerned with obtaining superior services than with making an award at the lowest overall price to the Government. However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall price to the Government to achieve slightly superior services. To receive consideration for award, a rating of no less than "Acceptable" must be achieved for Factor I, (Technical Capabilities). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with Offerors. Therefore, the Offeror's initial offer should contain the Offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES- The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the Offeror's methods and approach have adequately and completely considered, defined, and satisfied the requirements specified in the solicitation and whether the Offeror's methods and approach to meeting the solicitation requirements provide the Government with a high level of confidence of successful completion within the required schedule. No pricing information is to be provided in the Technical Proposal. The Government will evaluate the Offeror's understanding of the work to be performed in accordance with the SOW. The Offeror shall submit a proposal that demonstrates its understanding of the work described in Part 5 of the SOW. The government must receive enough information in a proposal to make a determination that the Offeror can complete the defined work or the proposal may be considered non-responsive.</p>
<p>PAST PERFORMANCE - The Offeror shall complete Part I of the Past Performance Questionnaire and e-mail the questionnaire to Government and private sector technical representatives responsible for the past/current contract. The Points Of Contact (POC) shall be instructed to electronically complete Part II of the questionnaire and e-mail the entire questionnaire to Contract Specialist, Mindy Smith at smith.mindy@dol.gov no later than March 9, 2012 at 9:00 am, EST. Please note, that the Past Performance Questionnaire will not be a part of the resultant contract.</p>
<p>PRICE- The Offeror shall provide a document outlining their pricing using the contract line items listed above. Pricing must be provided separately from your technical proposal.</p>
<p>EVALUATION SUMMARY</p>
<p>FACTOR I - TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES-The Offeror shall submit a proposal that acknowledges the tasks identified in the Statement of Work to allow the Government to make a sufficient determination that the Offeror is capable of performing the work. <br />Sub factor a. EXPERIENCE-The Offeror shall provide a synopsis of their experience in performing the tasks listed in the Statement of Work.<br />Sub factor b. UNDERSTANDING OF THE REQUIREMENT- The Government will evaluate the Offeror's understanding of the work to be performed in accordance with the SOW. The Offeror shall submit a proposal acknowledging that they are capable of completing the tasks identified in the Statement of Work, outlining their method and approach to completing the requirements.</p>
<p>FACTOR II - Past Performance-The The Government will evaluate past performance of three (3) current or previous contracts for relevancy (within 3 years) with at least one (1) previous or current contract with relevancy within the past 12 months based on how well the contractor performed on projects of similar dollar value, scope, and complexity. Offerors are advised that the Government may use past performance information obtained from centralized past performance databases and sources other than those identified by the Offeror and the information obtained may be used for both the responsibility determination and the best value decision. The absence of past performance data will be rated neither favorably nor unfavorably. Contracts listed may include those entered into with Government agencies or private sectors. For contractors with no relevant corporate past performance, the Government may take into account information regarding the past performance of predecessor companies, key personnel with relevant past performance, or subcontractors that will perform key aspects of the requirement. The Government will evaluate the Past Performance Elements specified in the Past Performance Questionnaire.</p>
<p>FACTOR III - PRICE The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total of all CLIN prices, including all options to ensure that pricing is not unbalanced. Price will be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness using the techniques in FAR 15.404-1(b) (2). Price will become significantly more important as technical ratings approach equality. No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Price.</p>
<p>Adjectival Ratings. Proposals will be adjectivally rated against each of the evaluation factors set forth in this plan and in the solicitation. Adjectival ratings for Factor I, Technical Capabilities and for Factor II-Past Performance follow. No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Factor III, Price.</p>
<p>Adjectival Ratings. The following adjectival ratings will be used:</p>
<p>Factor I- Technical Capabilities, will be rated using the following Adjectival Scale:<br />Outstanding-A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with extensive detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows a thorough understanding of the problems and offers numerous significant strengths, which are not offset by weaknesses, with an overall low degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Good-A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with adequate detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows an understanding of the problems and offers some significant strengths or numerous minor strengths, which are not offset by weaknesses, with an overall low to moderate degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Acceptable-A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with minimal detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows a minimal understanding of the problems, with an overall moderate to high degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Unacceptable-A proposal that contains a major error(s), omission(s) or deficiency(ies) that indicates a lack of understanding of the problems or an approach that cannot be expected to meet requirements or involves a very high risk; and none of these conditions can be corrected without a major rewrite or revision of the proposal.</p>
<p>Factor II-Past Performance, will be rated using the following Adjectival Scale:</p>
<p>Low Risk-Little doubt exists, based on the Offeror's performance record, that the Offeror can perform the proposed effort.</p>
<p>Medium Risk-Some doubt exists, based on the Offeror's performance record, that the Offeror can perform the proposed effort.</p>
<p>High Risk-Significant doubt exists, based on the Offeror's performance record, that the Offeror can perform the proposed effort.</p>
<p>Unknown Risk-Little or no relevant performance record identifiable; equates to an unknown risk rating having no favorable or unfavorable evaluation significance.</p>
<p>Non-Price Factors: The importance of the Non-Price Evaluation Factors is in the following descending order with the most important factor listed first: <br />Factor I, Technical Capabilities and its sub factors are significantly more important than Factor II, Past Performance and Factor III, Price. However, as Offeror's ratings for the non-price factors approach equality, Factor III, Price becomes significantly more important in the award decision.</p>
<p>Vendors who are exempt from the Service Contract Act must certify that the exemption applies using FAR 52.222-41,&nbsp;and 52.222-51 Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Maintenance, Calibration, or Repair of Certain Equipment-Requirements or 52.222-53 Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Certain Services-Requirements.&nbsp; Certification using FAR 52.222-48 Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Maintenance, Calibration, or Repair of Certain Equipment Certification or 52.222-52 Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Certain Services-Certification must be submitted with your proposal if applicable.<br /><br />Quotes must be received by Mindy Smith, Contract Specialist, no later than 9:00 am (EST) on April 20, 2012.

STATEMENT OF WORK:  
1. The nursing home shall ensure that care meets the health needs and promotes the maximum well being of VA patients.  Nursing home care will be furnished to ensure the total medical, nursing, and psychosocial needs of VA beneficiaries.  Physician visits, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services for VA patients will be at the same frequency as that provided to other patients at the nursing home receiving the same or comparable level of care.  In addition, the care provided will include room, meals, nursing care, and other services or supplies commensurate with the VA authorized level of care, without extra charge.  The per diem rate(s) will include the cost of medical care, oral medications, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services authorized by VA, unless otherwise specifically accepted.
2.  Full attention shall be given to motivating and educating patients to achieve and maintain independence in the activities of daily living.  Every effort shall be made to keep patients ambulatory and to achieve an optimal level of self-care.
3.  Absences of the patient from the nursing home in excess of 48 hours will not be reimbursable.
4.  Patients, who begin to require more than the level of care authorized by VA, will be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by VA.  When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non-Federal facility may be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained within 72 hours of admission of the patient to a non-Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non-emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA Medical Center will be accomplished as soon as the patients condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
5.  In the event a VA beneficiary receiving nursing home care under this contract dies, the nursing home will promptly notify the VA facility authorizing admission and immediately assemble, inventory, and safeguard the patient's personal effects.  The funds, deposits, and effects left by the VA patients upon the premises of the nursing home shall be delivered by the nursing home to the person or persons entitled thereto under the laws currently governing the nursing home for making disposition of funds and effects left by patients, unless the beneficiary died without leaving a will, heirs, or next of kin capable of inheriting.  When disposition has been made, the itemized inventory with annotation as to the disposition of the funds and effects will be immediately forwarded to the VA facility authorizing admission.  Should a deceased patient leave no will, heirs, or next of kin, his/her personal property and funds wherever located vests in and becomes the property of the United States in trust.  In these cases the nursing home will forward an inventory of any such property and funds in its possession to the VA facility authorizing admission and will hold them (except articles of clothing necessary for proper burial) under safeguard until instructions are received from VA concerning disposition.
6.  The nursing home shall not maintain nor provide dual or segregated patient facilities, which are segregated on the basis of race, creed, color, or national origin.  The nursing home shall neither require such segregated use by written or oral policies nor tolerate such use by local custom.  The term facilities shall include but not be limited to rooms, wards, sections, eating areas, drinking fountains, entrances, and other like areas.  It is agreed that VA will have the right to inspection of the nursing home and all appurtenances by authorized VA representative(s) to ensure that acceptable standards are maintained and that the necessary care to maintain the well being of the patient is rendered.
7.  Veterans receiving care under this agreement, who begin to require acute hospital care, will be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by the VA.   When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non-Federal facility may be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained as soon as possible and not to exceed 72 hours of admission to the non-Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non-emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA facility will be accomplished as soon as the patient's condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
8.  If a veteran is re-hospitalized from the nursing home, the nursing home and VA facility will arrange to hold a bed in reserve, when such a decision is in the best interest of the patient and the VA.  The number of covered bed hold days will be determined by VA on a case-by-case basis, but will not exceed the number of bed hold days allowed by state Medicaid regulations.  Payment will follow state Medicaid regulations.  The VA facility will include payment for these "bed hold" days only when the conditions above are met.
9.  The VA facility will approve leave days (days away from the nursing home) for long-term placements.  The leave must be part of a therapeutic plan and approved by VA.  Leave days at VA expense are limited to 6 days per calendar year.  Payment will follow state Medicaid regulations.  Exceptions may be approved by the VA facility director or designee.
10.  Patients receiving care under this contract, who begin to require more than the level of care authorized by VA, will be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by VA.   When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non Federal facility may be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained within 72 hours of admission of the patient to a non Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA Medical Center will be accomplished as soon as the patient's condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
11.  It is agreed that VA will have the right to on-site reviews of the nursing home and all appurtenances by authorized VA representative(s) to ensure that acceptable standards are maintained and that the necessary care to maintain the well-being of the patient is rendered.
12.  The nursing home shall provide all services specified herein, regardless of the race, color, religion, sex or national origin of the person for whom such services are ordered.  In addition, the nursing home warrants that subcontracting will not be resorted to as a means of circumventing this provision.
13.  It is agreed that duly authorized representatives of VA will provide follow-up supervision visits to veterans placed to assure the continuity of care and to assist in the veteran's transition back into the community.  It is understood that these visits do not substitute nor relieve the nursing home in any way of the responsibility for the daily care and medical treatment of the veteran.
14.  All medical records concerning the veterans care in the nursing home will be readily accessible to VA.  Upon discharge or death of the patient, medical records will be retained by the nursing home for a period of at least three years following termination of care.  Patient records will be maintained in conformance with the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a).

16.  The contract for the affected patient will terminate whenever a VA patient is rehospitalized for 15 calendar days or more, whether in a VA or in a non-Federal facility.  A new authorization agreement and contract will be considered at the time the patient returns.
17.  Level of Care Classification Effective Records: VA will contract for 50 categories of care under Resource Utilization Groups (RUG-IV).

In addition, assessment will be made eight (8) days after the completion of an episode of authorized rehabilitation therapy, after a rehospitalization, after a significant change in status and at VAs request.

Nursing home care will be furnished to ensure the total medical, nursing, and psychosocial needs of VA beneficiaries.  Physician visits, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services for VA patients will be at the same frequency as that provided to other patients at the nursing home receiving the same or comparable level of care.

STATEMENT OF WORK:  
1. The nursing home shall ensure that care meets the health needs and promotes the maximum well being of VA patients.  Nursing home care will be furnished to ensure the total medical, nursing, and psychosocial needs of VA beneficiaries.  Physician visits, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services for VA patients will be at the same frequency as that provided to other patients at the nursing home receiving the same or comparable level of care.  In addition, the care provided will include room, meals, nursing care, and other services or supplies commensurate with the VA authorized level of care, without extra charge.  The per diem rate(s) will include the cost of medical care, oral medications, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services authorized by VA, unless otherwise specifically accepted.
2.  Full attention shall be given to motivating and educating patients to achieve and maintain independence in the activities of daily living.  Every effort shall be made to keep patients ambulatory and to achieve an optimal level of self-care.
3.  Absences of the patient from the nursing home in excess of 48 hours will not be reimbursable.
4.  Patients, who begin to require more than the level of care authorized by VA, will be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by VA.  When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non-Federal facility may be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained within 72 hours of admission of the patient to a non-Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non-emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA Medical Center will be accomplished as soon as the patients condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
5.  In the event a VA beneficiary receiving nursing home care under this contract dies, the nursing home will promptly notify the VA facility authorizing admission and immediately assemble, inventory, and safeguard the patient's personal effects.  The funds, deposits, and effects left by the VA patients upon the premises of the nursing home shall be delivered by the nursing home to the person or persons entitled thereto under the laws currently governing the nursing home for making disposition of funds and effects left by patients, unless the beneficiary died without leaving a will, heirs, or next of kin capable of inheriting.  When disposition has been made, the itemized inventory with annotation as to the disposition of the funds and effects will be immediately forwarded to the VA facility authorizing admission.  Should a deceased patient leave no will, heirs, or next of kin, his/her personal property and funds wherever located vests in and becomes the property of the United States in trust.  In these cases the nursing home will forward an inventory of any such property and funds in its possession to the VA facility authorizing admission and will hold them (except articles of clothing necessary for proper burial) under safeguard until instructions are received from VA concerning disposition.
6.  The nursing home shall not maintain nor provide dual or segregated patient facilities, which are segregated on the basis of race, creed, color, or national origin.  The nursing home shall neither require such segregated use by written or oral policies nor tolerate such use by local custom.  The term facilities shall include but not be limited to rooms, wards, sections, eating areas, drinking fountains, entrances, and other like areas.  It is agreed that VA will have the right to inspection of the nursing home and all appurtenances by authorized VA representative(s) to ensure that acceptable standards are maintained and that the necessary care to maintain the well being of the patient is rendered.
7.  Veterans receiving care under this agreement, who begin to require acute hospital care, will be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by the VA.   When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non-Federal facility may be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained as soon as possible and not to exceed 72 hours of admission to the non-Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non-emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA facility will be accomplished as soon as the patient's condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
8.  If a veteran is re-hospitalized from the nursing home, the nursing home and VA facility will arrange to hold a bed in reserve, when such a decision is in the best interest of the patient and the VA.  The number of covered bed hold days will be determined by VA on a case-by-case basis, but will not exceed the number of bed hold days allowed by state Medicaid regulations.  Payment will follow state Medicaid regulations.  The VA facility will include payment for these "bed hold" days only when the conditions above are met.
9.  The VA facility will approve leave days (days away from the nursing home) for long-term placements.  The leave must be part of a therapeutic plan and approved by VA.  Leave days at VA expense are limited to 6 days per calendar year.  Payment will follow state Medicaid regulations.  Exceptions may be approved by the VA facility director or designee.
10.  Patients receiving care under this contract, who begin to require more than the level of care authorized by VA, will be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by VA.   When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non Federal facility may be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained within 72 hours of admission of the patient to a non Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA Medical Center will be accomplished as soon as the patient's condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
11.  It is agreed that VA will have the right to on-site reviews of the nursing home and all appurtenances by authorized VA representative(s) to ensure that acceptable standards are maintained and that the necessary care to maintain the well-being of the patient is rendered.
12.  The nursing home shall provide all services specified herein, regardless of the race, color, religion, sex or national origin of the person for whom such services are ordered.  In addition, the nursing home warrants that subcontracting will not be resorted to as a means of circumventing this provision.
13.  It is agreed that duly authorized representatives of VA will provide follow-up supervision visits to veterans placed to assure the continuity of care and to assist in the veteran's transition back into the community.  It is understood that these visits do not substitute nor relieve the nursing home in any way of the responsibility for the daily care and medical treatment of the veteran.
14.  All medical records concerning the veterans care in the nursing home will be readily accessible to VA.  Upon discharge or death of the patient, medical records will be retained by the nursing home for a period of at least three years following termination of care.  Patient records will be maintained in conformance with the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a).

16.  The contract for the affected patient will terminate whenever a VA patient is rehospitalized for 15 calendar days or more, whether in a VA or in a non-Federal facility.  A new authorization agreement and contract will be considered at the time the patient returns.
17.  Level of Care Classification Effective Records: VA will contract for 50 categories of care under Resource Utilization Groups (RUG-IV).

In addition, assessment will be made eight (8) days after the completion of an episode of authorized rehabilitation therapy, after a rehospitalization, after a significant change in status and at VAs request.  Classification changes will be approved by VA. VA staff will audit approximately 20% of the MDS assessments.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br /><br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Commandant (CG-931)<br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half Street., SW, JR11-0203 <br />Washington, DC 20593-0001 <br />Telephone 202.372.3692<br />Fax: 202.475-3904</p>

         (A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or

         (C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.
 
       (ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs) including the United Nations (UN) agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and man-made disaster situations.  It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>To fulfill its mandate to effectively respond to disasters worldwide, OFDA has established six permanent regional offices in Budapest, Hungary; San Jose, Costa Rica; Nairobi, Kenya; Dakar, Senegal; Pretoria, South Africa; and Bangkok, Thailand; and three sub-regional offices in Almaty, Kazakhstan, Cairo, Egypt and Jakarta, Indonesia.</p>
<p>The regional offices are headed by Principal Regional Advisors (PRAs) who report to the Disaster Response Team Leader in Washington. PRAs serve as the regional team leader for all response, preparedness and disaster risk reduction activities. They primarily serve as the key interlocutor with embassies and missions in the event of a disaster but may also serve as DART leader if needed.  They are principally responsible for managing the regional offices, monitoring all grants on humanitarian assistance program implementation, overseeing the sub-regional offices, as appropriate, supervising the office staff, and developing, in consultation with their respective Washington-based Regional Coordinators, the multi-year response program strategies for their respective regions.  The PRAs coordinate with OFDA/Washington on disaster response activities, determine program priorities, and identify and formulate disaster preparedness, mitigation and training programs for their respective regions.  The Regional Advisors (RAs) reporting to the PRAs ensure that OFDA's objectives for disaster response and assistance, strategic reporting and analysis are met. The RAs are responsible for monitoring and reporting on OFDA-funded programs and activities, and formulating disaster response, preparedness, mitigation and training programs for the region.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA requires the services of a RA in Nairobi, Kenya to ensure OFDA's ability to respond to humanitarian emergencies and monitor ongoing programming in East and Central Africa.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>This RA position requires an individual who is able to travel outside of the country where they are based, on short notice for two to three weeks at a time, or longer, on occasion. The incumbent will serve as the primary contact and liaison for on-going disaster activities related to disaster response, preparedness, mitigation and training programs.  The incumbent will work to increase the capability of host governments, IOs, and NGOs to respond and prepare for disasters in the affected region. The RA will be responsible for disaster analysis, program monitoring, overseeing NGO partner implementation, reporting to OFDA Washington, and liaising with USAID Missions and U.S. Embassies.</p>
<p>A) Disaster Response - Working directly under the guidance and supervision of the respective PRA, the incumbent will:</p>
<p>&bull;	Travel to the scene of a disaster or potential disaster and assist in initial assessments of damages and needs; determine appropriate relief assistance and emergency interventions, in consultation with OFDA/Washington and/or the PRA; and provide timely reporting cables and other written analysis of these events;<br />&bull;	Coordinate and liaise with representatives of host governments, donor governments, IOs, NGOs, U.S. Embassies, and USAID Missions to facilitate cooperation and coordination in disaster response activities;<br />&bull;	Monitor DCHA/OFDA-funded activities and report in accordance with OFDA guidelines, policies, and requirements;<br />&bull;	Serve as DART Team Leader as required or as a DART team member during  a disaster response;<br />&bull;	Maintain regular communications with the regional (and/or sub-regional) office in their area of responsibility and with OFDA/Washington;<br />&bull;	Prepare specific requested field information and subject reports, as required by OFDA/Washington.<br /> <br />B) Disaster Preparedness - Working closely with OFDA/Washington and drawing on the skills and technical expertise within the office and available through inter- and intra-agency agreements, the incumbent will assist representatives of host government organizations, IOs, and NGOs in the development of strong emergency and disaster preparedness/mitigation programs.</p>
<p>Specifically, the incumbent, in collaboration with OFDA regional/sub-regional team colleagues, will:</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist with the design, development, and implementation of strategies and integrated disaster assistance and response for OFDA, local governments, and other donors/organizations as appropriate;<br />&bull;	Advise regional officials, including host country authorities and other USAID and/or U.S. Embassy officials on OFDA's efforts in disaster response and management;<br />&bull;	Provide support for other OFDA initiatives in the assigned region as identified by the incumbent's respective Regional Office and/or sub-regional team.  Support may include but is not limited to assessment/evaluation visits, project design exercises and hazards/vulnerability/risk analysis;<br />&bull;	Coordinate with other agencies/organizations to identify critical disaster concerns affecting the region and countries and develop projects/activities for addressing these;<br />&bull;	Work with representatives of local and regional institutions and private/public sector organizations to incorporate preparedness and mitigation into appropriate programs;<br />&bull;	Prepare regular strategic and analytical reports on current or anticipated emergencies, as well as comprehensive preparedness documentation on assigned countries.<br /> <br />SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The RA will report directly to the PRA. However, for certain activities, the RA will coordinate tasks with the respective Team Leader in OFDA/Washington.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />Supervisory controls will be minimal. The PRA will provide direction in terms of broadly defined program goals and objectives. The RA is expected to act independently with little direction and will have wide latitude for the exercise of independent judgment.</p>
<p>10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands.  During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>Questions and Answers <br />1. With regard to the first deliverable of DVD with time code burn of approximately 40 hours of footage - the request is for "2 DVD's". Forty hours of raw footage translates to roughly 1 hour per DVD for a total of 40 DVD's. Does the government desire &lsquo;2 sets' of 40 DVD's? <br />Answer: Yes, 2 sets of DVDs.<br />2. Will NIOSH be supplying all of the motion graphics or will contractor need to design and create elements as well (other than the opening graphic)? <br />Answer: NIOSH will create motion graphics for opening only.<br />3. By specifying Adobe Creative Suite 5, does this mean the government and contractor will be sending AfterEffects/PhotoShop.etc. files back and forth?<br />Answer: Yes, if changes are needed.<br />4. For Task Deliverable 2, will NIOSH footage include broll as well as &lsquo;interview' footage? In other words, is the supplied footage mostly demonstration broll or a combination which includes interviews?<br />Answer: Yes, there will be brief description of the machine and interviews to describe the content. B roll may be used but most of the transitions will dissolve by way of Adobe premiere (provided by the contractor.)<br />5. Is the supplied footage format in 4:3, 16:9 or a combination of the two? <br />Answer: Possibly both; our film person uses DVC pro 25 tape format. <br />6. With regard to the NIOSH supplied script and narration, will the government provide the professional voice talent or will contractor need to have the audio re-cut by professional talent?<br />Answer: NIOSH has a narrator. This audio will be supplied with the video and is expected to be combined.<br />7. RFQ mentions that NIOSH will provide a &lsquo;proof' that includes shots, b-roll, images, graphics, audio and text.' Is this a storyboard? We are unclear as to what is meant by a &lsquo;proof.'<br />Answer: Yes, this is a story board - with files listed to accompany and explain what goes where in the timeline. <br />

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC>Responses to questions asked during site visit at Gowen Field, Boise ID 09 April 9, 2012.<br><br>1.  What is the highest number of military members served on one day in the facility.<br>	Answer:  On average the number of diners is 450 per day, but could be as many as 600.<br>2.  Is this the only facility available for Air National Guard members to dine at?<br>	Answer:  Yes.  This is the only facility where Air National Guard drill status guardsmen can receive their entitled meal.<br>3.  How is the leftover food handled?<br>	Answer:  The military member will fill out a food waste log, if food can be used for alternate drill weekend, the dining facility attendants will help prepare for storage, and store.  The military member will decide how to dispose of the remaining excess food.<br>4.  Who orders food, provides chemicals for cleaning, and takes money for paying customers?<br>	Answer:  The government will order all of the food, provide cleaning supplies, and handle all customers signing for or paying cash for meals.<br>5.  Who is responsible for portion control?<br>	Answer:  The contractor, IAW the AF 662 log.<br>6.  Who is responsible for broken equipment, i.e steam table, belt on vacuum?<br>	Answer:  The contractor must notify the government when a defect is noticed.  The government is responsible for all repairs to equipment.<br>7.  Estimate the number the previous contractor used to accomplish their contract requirement?<br>	Answer:  This is up to the contractor to determine the appropriate number of employees to staff the facility to meet the government's needs, as stated in the PWS.  The structure of the contract requirement has changed since the previous contract award, so there is no guarantee that the number of employees the previous contractor used would be appropriate for this requirement.  Historically, there were approximately 20 dining facility attendants, and approximately 3 to 4 contract cooks. <br>8.  How would the contract structure change if the Wings flying mission changed?<br>	Answer:  If the Wing's flying mission changed, the contract would be potentially modified as necessary based on the change in mission needs.<br>9.  Is the contract paid based on the $4.55 per meal rate?<br>	Answer:  No.  This rate is provided strictly for informational purposes only.  The government is providing all of the food and facility maintenance.  The contractor is only expected to perform those functions as established in the solicitation.  This is the rate that a contractor employee would be expected to pay if they chose to eat a meal in the facility, while on break.  The contractor will not receive any form of compensation or proceeds from the number of meals that are served, signed for or sold.  The contractor is paid the same monthly amount as awarded on the contract if 300 meals are served, or 600 meals are served.<br>10.  Does the Randolph- Sheppard Act apply?<br>	Answer:  Yes.<br>11.  What happens if there is a National Security issue that interferes with contract employee's ability to leave the installation.<br>	Answer:  Nothing of this nature has happened in 10 years, but if such a situation arose, where a contractor was delayed for a substantial period of time, the contract would be modified as necessary.<br>12.  Clarify when a contractor would need to read and follow an AF Form 662, please provide a copy of the AF Form 662.<br>	Answer:  The dining facility attendants would be required to read and follow an AF Form 662 to prepare items for the salad bar.  Contract cooks would need to read and follow the AF Form 662 and recipes when preparing food.  It is the contractor's responsibility to provide any magnifying or reading enhancement tools necessary to perform the contract.<br>13.  Clarify if the ceiling light covers in the dining area are required to be cleaned by the contractor.<br>	Answer:  No.<br>

Task orders will be FFP.<br /><br />NIST has facilities located in Boulder, Colorado and Wellington, Colorado. These locations consist of approximately 30 separate buildings totaling approximately 650,000 square feet, which consist of scientific research laboratories and clean rooms, warehouses, machine shops, maintenance shops, a central utility plant, administrative offices and conference/auditorium facilities, along with radio transmission sites. The age of the facilities ranges from the late 1950s to present day, state of the art technology and construction. The NIST is seeking qualified firms to provide construction services, with emphasis on firms that have general contractor capabilities and experience with multiple-craft construction projects. <br /><br />Each IDIQ will have a twelve (12) month base period of performance with options for four additional twelve (12) month periods. Each IDIQ contract awarded will have a $3,000 minimum over the life of the contract. The total awarded under all multiple award IDIQ contracts will not exceed $50,000,000 over the life of the contracts.<br /><br />The proposed contracts are 100% set-aside for small business concerns. The NAICS code for this requirement is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, and the size standard is $33.5 million in annual receipts (average annual gross revenue for the last three years.)
<p>It is important to note that, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.219-14, the contractors will be required to perform at least 15% (for general construction) or 25% (for special trade construction) of the cost of contract, not including the cost of materials, with its own employees.</p>

<p>b. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options.</p>
<p>c. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer, whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(End of Provision)</p>
<p>Representations and Certifications:<br /><br />All offerors must include a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certification-Commercial Items (Feb 2012).

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.<br />

<DESC>___________________________________________________<br />Added: 11 April 2012
<p>This is further market research and is not a solicitation for the environmental graphics. The purpose of the this posting is to gather more market research to gain a better insight of exactly what the statement of work needs to contain so the contractor completely understands the government requirements.</p>
<p>Please review the draft statement of work Titled: Draft SOW Environmental Graphics 10-April-2012. Please then review the questions below. Fire prevention and infection control information are also attached as described at the industry day. If you have any comments about the SOW and/or are able to answer the questions please reply to Keith.Brandner@wpafb.af.mil.</p>
<p>Government's Questions:</p>
<p>What type of material will the pop-out board need to be? Pop out boards will need to be both clear for interchangeable materials as well as printed with pictures as words. We currently as saying a cardboard type material for the printed boards but is this accurate? Is this cardboard or sometime of composite wood or plastic? What are some types of materials we might be able to choose from for this?</p>
<p>What type of wall paper will be used that can last a lifetime and not fade including cleaning by hospital grade cleaners? Are there many different types that will satisfy this requirement? Is there an industry standard that describes lifetime durability? Is the type of wallpaper the most important aspect here or will the type of adhesive be equally as important? We do know that we want to require that the adhesive last a lifetime.</p>
<p>Do you need any more information on the fire codes and infection control for the hospital other than the attachments or is this information sufficient to create a bid and complete work at the proposed cost?</p>
<p>Please reply by 18-April-2012 at 1000 EST</p>

No proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis. This is not a solicitation for proposals and no contract shall be awarded from this synopsis.<br />The purpose of this anticipated contract is to procure repairs to Paveway III Laser-Guided Bombs. The item anticipated to be repaired is:<br />NSN: 1325-01-356-1432<br />Noun: WGU-39/B
<p>Estimated Repair Quantity: 400ea</p>
<p><br />The anticipated contract will be a firm-fixed price and will support the United States Air Force. Total contract value is anticipated to be approximately $3,500,000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paveway Laser Guided Bombs are purchased to a Performance Specification and as a result, the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) owns the drawing/technical data package. The Government cannot provide access to product drawing because of the Government's lack of data rights in the data. The item being considered for repair is very technical by nature, as it is provides guidance for a specific munitions item. The WGU-39/B determines the appropriate method to guide the munitions item from point of release to a laser-illuminated target. It is extremely complex, and the Government knows of no entity other than the OEM with sufficient technical data rights to the WGU-39/B to provide this requirement. The Government can provide no reverse engineering funds at this time in order to develop technical data required to fill this requirement.</p>
<p>Offeror's response to this Synopsis shall be limited to five pages and shall include the following information:<br />Offeror's name, address, point of contact, phone number, e-mail address, and CAGE code if applicable.<br />Offeror's interest in bidding on the solicitation when it is issued.<br />Small Business Size and status if applicable.<br />A capability statement that pertains to the anticipated contract. Capability statement shall include a statement of the offeror's plan to obtain requisite technical data rights for this requirement, or evidence of the offeror's possession of sufficient data rights.<br />Any other information that the Offeror feels is pertinent to the anticipated contract.</p>
<p><br />Interested Offerors shall respond to this Sources Sought Synopsis no later than 4:00 PM (MTN) 13 April 2012. All interested contractors must be registered in CCR to be eligible for award of Government contracts. Email your response to Mrs. Carmen North, Contract Negotiator email carmen.north@hill.af.mil or Mr. Nathan Lee, Contracting Officer email address: nathan.lee@hill.af.mil</p>

<DESC>The US Army is surveying the marketplace to determine the availability of additional tire sources or tire/rim sources for the M1000 Heavy Equipment Transporter System (HETS) trailer. The M1000 is used to transport the M1 Series Main Battle Tank during operation. The M1000 contains ten axles each having four tires, for a total of 40 tires per trailer (plus 2 spares). Maximum trailer payload is 140,000 lbs. Tire load at maximum payload is up to 3850 lbs. Testing and qualification are planned to be conducted in accordance with Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) J2014 and ATPD 2130D specification and funded by the Government. The Government is conducting an analysis of alternatives using three different scenarios for additional sources, each with an increasing logistical impact. The first scenario is evaluating a tire in the same size as the M1000 as currently configured (215/75R17.5). The second scenario involves evaluating tire in a different size, but acceptable for use on the existing approved rim (Accuride p/n 28112 17.5X6.75HC). The third scenario involves evaluating tires and wheels in a different size. If responding to third scenario, please include both tire and wheel information. Information provided by vendors will be used by the Government for analysis and requirements development.<br><br>Only electronic responses are requested. Please provide responses in any of the following formats: Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Power Point, or Adobe PDF.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) - Sources Sought<br>Protective Over Garment (POG)<br><br>BACKGROUND:  Product Manager - Soldier Protective Equipment (PM SPE) is seeking sources and to collect information for the possible production of the Tier II - Protective Over Garment (POG).  The prevalence of IEDs during dismounted operations in Operation Enduring Freedom has caused a greater number of injuries to the lower body.  These include blast injuries surrounding the groin area affecting the colon, femoral artery, and genitalia.  The current Improved Outer Tactical Vest (IOTV) add-on groin protector equipment only offers protection from frontal threats.  PM SPE believes a two-tiered system will provide the optimal combination of protection and user acceptance. The Tier II - POG - part of the Pelvic Protection System - is an item that will provide protection against ground based IED threats.   The POG is worn over the Army Combat Uniform trousers and provides protection of the pelvis, femoral arteries, and lower abdominal organs in a blast or fragmentation event.  The POG will also reduce the penetration of dirt and fine debris into a wound area to prevent infections.<br><br> PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS:<br>At a minimum, the Tier II Protective Over Garment (POG):<br><br>- Shall consist of three (3) distinct areas of ballistic protection to provide an optimum balance of protection and mobility.  The front section shall provide at least 69 in2 of ballistic protection, the center section shall fit between the legs and provide at least 50 in2 of ballistic protection, and rear section shall provide at least 52 in2 of ballistic protection for a size medium system.<br><br>- Front and rear sections shall provide ballistic protection which conforms to the base vest requirements of FQ/PD 07-05E.  Center section shall provide ballistic resistance (V50) of at least 1120 ft/s against 17gr Fragment Simulating Projectile (FSP).  Wherever there is no continuous ballistic material, a minimum 1 in. overlap shall be maintained to prevent gaps in coverage.<br><br>- Front, center, and rear ballistic materials shall be removable/replaceable.<br><br>- Ballistic filler areal density of front and rear sections shall not exceed 1.10 lb/ft2 with a maximum 0.30 in. thickness.  Ballistic filler weight of center section shall not exceed 0.40 lb/ft2 with a maximum 0.10 in. thickness.<br><br>- Shall provide a secure fastening mechanism to prevent flapping or shifting during use.  The system shall be compatible with currently fielded personal protective equipment and combat uniform and shall attach either to the body armor and/or the belt loops of the trousers.<br><br>- Front section shall be capable of being disconnected from the center/rear section and worn as a standalone item, with the option of fastening to the belt or Improved Outer Tactical Vest.  Shall provide a secure fastening mechanism to prevent flapping or shifting during use.  <br><br>- Attachment point(s) connecting the front section to center section must be able to withstand a peak load of 150 lbs break strength in accordance with ASTM D-5043<br><br>- Attachment points/seams connecting the rear panel to center section must be able to withstand a peak load of 600 lbs break strength in accordance with ASTM D-5043<br><br><br>-	Shall be capable of donning and doffing without removing the belt from the Army Combat<br>Uniform trousers<br><br>-  Must be available in multiple sizes to fit 5th percentile female through 95th percentile male waist circumference.<br><br>- Outer facing cloth shall be constructed with the following camouflage pattern: US Army Operational Enduring Freedom Camouflage Pattern (OCP)<br><br>SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: Responses shall include the following information:<br>a.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK
CONSTRUCTION SERVICES FOR PROJECT 620A4-11-106
INSTALL FRONT GATE TRAFFIC CONTROL CENTER 
AND INCREASE SURFACE PARKING AT CASTLE POINT CAMPUS


BACKGROUND:
Recent world events have precipitated changes in the requirements for security at all public and government facilities.  As a result of these changes VA policies for public safety and security have been focused on providing increased patient, employee, and public safety.  In order to comply with these directives it is necessary that the VA Castle Point campus reconfigure the main entrance for the campus to provide better screening of the incoming traffic by the VA Police department.  In addition to increased security, the project will also be much safer for our police to perform this vital task than the current arrangement which requires that they stand in the oncoming traffic lane.  

The Castle Point campus also serves a very rural area with little to no public transportation available for patients, employees, or visitors.  Due to this fact it becomes very difficult for patients to find parking spots near the main entrance of the hospital.  VA guidelines state that patient parking is supposed to be situated as close to the main entrance of the hospital.  In order to accomplish this, we need to expand one of the existing parking lots. 
OBJECTIVES:
This Project will install a front gate traffic control center and increase surface parking at Castle Point campus.  Recent security mandates require increased security screening. The current arrangement of the front gate poses grave safety risks for the VA Police officers tasked with manning it.  The new building will enhance the ability of the VA Police department to both screen incoming traffic and to increase traffic flow rates into and out of the facility at peak hours.  In addition it will allow for a further increase of much needed inpatient and visitor parking closer to the main hospital entrance and patient care wards.  It will accomplish this by moving staff and government owned vehicle parking to an extension of an existing parking lot.

SCOPE: 
Base Bid:
The contractor will furnish all materials, equipment, supervision, and personnel necessary to accomplish the work set forth in the provided specifications and drawings titled Install Front Gate Traffic Control Center and Increase Surface Parking at Castle Point Campus.  The contractor will be required to comply with all applicable VA specifications, regulations, procedures.  The contractor will also be required to comply with any applicable Federal, State, and local laws, statutes, and regulations.  

Contractor will make all efforts to minimize disruptions to the normal traffic flow patterns of the medical facility.  In order to accomplish this, it is anticipated that the contractor will need to accomplish some aspects of the project during off hours and weekends.  Any off hours and weekend work will not incur additional costs to the government.

The Certification and Accreditation requirements do not apply to this project.
Deduct Alternate:
Contractor is to provide deduct alternate for removal of the items denoted inclusive of Increase Surface Parking Phase 1, Increase Surface Parking Phase 2, Increase Surface Parking Phase 3, and Increase Surface Parking Phase 4 as shown on drawing number GC-101, detail #6, dated 7/12/2011
PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:

The period of performance for the base Bid will be 450 days from Notice to Proceed (NTP)

The period of performance for Deduct Alternate will be 280 days

PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:
Castle Point VA Medical Center, Castle Point, NY
GOVERNEMENT FURNISHED INFORMATION:
Contractor will be furnished with contract documents to include but not limited to technical specifications and working drawings.
SECURITY:
Contractor and subcontractor employees will be required to secure facility ID badges from the VA Police Department.
SAFETY CODES/CERTIFICATION/LICENSING:
Contractor will be required to abide by all applicable VA, Federal, State, and Local safety codes, laws, and regulations that apply.
TRAVEL:
Contractor does not have any special requirements for travel. Travel to and from the contractors place of business to the place of performance is included in the price of the contract. 
REQUIREMENTS UNIQUE TO SOLICITATION:
Contractor will make all efforts to minimize disruption of traffic patterns at medical center.  This may require that the contractor work off hours and weekends.  Off hour and weekend work will be accomplished at no additional cost to the government.  A detailed phasing plan will be provided to the government as part of the submittal process and must be approved before work commences.

NTP for this project will not be held until Spring of 2013 due to conflicts with other projects.

<DESC>A/B MAC Jurisdiction K (Previously Jurisdiction 13 and Jurisdiction 14) Pre-solicitation Notice:
<p>As required by section 911 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), CMS must re-compete its Part A &amp; B Medicare Administrative Contractor (A/B MAC) contracts every five (5) years. The purpose of this contract is to obtain a A/B MAC (hereinafter, referred to as "the Contractor") to provide specified health insurance benefit administration services, including Medicare claims processing and payment services, in support of the Medicare FFS program. The Contractor shall perform its responsibilities under the direction of CMS.</p>
<p>The Contractor will perform numerous functions to support health care services for Medicare beneficiaries, which include performing claims-related activities and establishing relationships with providers of health care services, both institutional and professional, for a defined geographic area or "jurisdiction." The Contractor will perform the requirements of this contract in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, Medicare manuals, and CMS requirements to ensure the financial integrity of the Medicare program. The Medicare program's legal, policy, and operating environment is complex, and the Contractor will utilize or interact with certain CMS-required payment schedules, systems, equipment, and operational capabilities in the performance of its functions. Further, the Contractor will coordinate its activities not only with the CMS, but also with a broad range of agencies (at the federal, state, and local levels of government), other CMS partners and Contractors, and a diverse range of stakeholders within the health care system of the United States.</p>
<p>In accordance with CMS' technical specifications, the Contractor shall receive and control Medicare claims from institutional and professional providers, suppliers, and beneficiaries within its jurisdiction and will perform standard or required editing on these claims to determine whether the claims are complete and should be paid. An edit is defined as "logic within the Standard Claims Processing System (or PSC/ZPIC Supplemental Edit Software) that selects certain claims, evaluates or compares information on the selected claims or other accessible source, and, depending on the evaluation, takes action on the claims, such as pay in full, pay in part, or suspend for manual review."</p>
<p>In addition, the Contractor calculates Medicare payment amounts and remits these payments to the appropriate party. The Contractor also will enroll new providers; conduct redeterminations on appeals of claims; operate a Provider Customer Service Program (PCSP) that educates providers about the Medicare program and responds to provider telephone and written inquiries; respond to complex inquiries from Beneficiary Contact Centers (BCCs); and make coverage decisions for new procedures and devices in local areas. The Contractor also will conduct a variety of different provider services, such as enrolling new providers in the program, answering written inquiries, and educating providers on Medicare's rules, regulations, and billing procedures.</p>
<p>CMS anticipates releasing a solicitation for Jurisdiction K- Previously Jurisdiction 13 and Jurisdiction 14 (comprised of the states of New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont, Maine and New Hampshire) on or about May 4, 2012. The contract will include a base year plus four one-year options. The anticipated proposal due date is June 18, 2012 with an anticipated award date of January 25, 2013.</p>
<p>This solicitation is expected to be issued as pending availability of funds.</p>

<p><strong>Industrial Wastewater Treatment Plant (IWTP) System Description:<br /><br /></strong>ANAD is a major rework and repair facility performing maintenance on the heavy and light combat vehicles. The Depot also performs maintenance on land combat missiles and small arms. The maintenance operations result in the production of various industrial wastes. Industrial wastewater is generated from a variety of metal finishing and electro-plating processes, and preparatory cleaning of disassembled components. This includes the steam cleaning of engines, transmissions, and other pieces of equipment. A new 600 KGD IWTP (industrial wastewater treatment plant) is serving ANAD from 25 March 2001 replacing the former IWTP. The influent to the IWTP consists of four streams, listed below with average daily flows.</p>
<p>&bull; chrome wastewater - 3620,000 gpd (gallons per day) average with a minimum of 0 gpd and a maximum of 150,000 gpd (identify average, min, and max quantities)<br />&bull; cyanide wastewater - 10,000 gpd (identify average, min, and max quantities)not a current waste stream, but could be at an average rate of 10,000 gpd in the future<br />&bull; general wastewater - 30075,000 gpd (identify average, with a minimum of 75 gpm and a maximum of 310 gpm min, and max quantities)<br />&bull; steam cleaning wastewater - 75,000 gpd average, with a minimum of 75 gpm and a maximum of 310 gpm300,000 gpd (identify average, min, and max quantities)</p>
<p>The general wastewater comes from the general wastewater lagoons at the former IWTP, industrial area gravity sewers and force mains, chrome reaction tank, and cyanide holding tank. The chrome and cyanide waste streams are treated in independent processes and then pumped to the general wastewater equalization tank. The steam cleaning wastewater comes from steam cleaning wastewater lagoons at the former IWTP and industrial area steam cleaning wastewater gravity sewers and force mains. The chrome wastewater comes from the chrome wastewater gravity sewers and force mains. The cyanide wastewater comes from four collection sumps.<br />The chrome and cyanide waste streams are treated to remove the hexavalent chromium and the cyanide respectively before being combined in the general wastewater equalization tank. The hexavalent chromium is reduced to trivalent chromium while the cyanide molecule is destroyed and converted to carbon dioxide and water.</p>
<p>The general wastewater has concentrations of trace metals, trivalent chrome, solids, and soluble organic matter. The steam cleaning wastewater has concentrations of trace metals, oil &amp; grease, and solids. The metals of concern are: cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, nickel, zinc, and silver. The different influent sources are treated in two different process trains until the neutralization tanks where the two flows are combined before entering the neutralization tanks. The combined flow, which is designated common wastewater, is treated for biological uptake in the trickling filter. The general wastewater and steam cleaning wastewater flows are segregated as the solids generated from each stream have different disposal requirements. The general wastewater dewatered solids are a hazardous waste while the steam cleaning wastewater dewatered solids are non-hazardous.</p>
<p>The IWTP processes consist of equalization, precipitation, gravity settling, solids dewatering, neutralization, filtration, biological oxidation (BOD), and pH adjustment. Equalization is performed in two concrete tanks equipped with mechanical mixers. The precipitation is performed utilizing ferric chloride, lime, and a polymer. The gravity settling is performed in an inclined plate clarifier. The solids dewatering is performed in two plate and frame presses. The pH neutralization is performed using sulfuric acid and lime. The filtration is performed in four multimedia pressure filters. The biological oxidation of BOD is performed by a trickling filter and clarifier.</p>
<p>The IWTP is controlled through a PCS (process control system). The IWTP is designed to operate without direct operator supervision. The PCS combines a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC), Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), Human Machine Interface (HMI), Operator Interface Terminals (OIT), and Local-Off-Remote (L-O-R) switches to control and monitor equipment utilized at the IWTP. The PCS mechanically and electrically controls the movement of wastewater through the treatment plant and the injection of chemicals. The PCS does not optimize the treatment processes.<br />The PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) is the brain of the IWTP. The PLC receives information from multiple devices in the field (pH meters, flow meters, turbidity meters, level sensors) which when combined with internal logic allows the PLC to make decisions on when equipment should be started and stopped. In addition, the PLC determines when alarms should be activated and whether the alarm is an equipment failure or a treatment process problem.</p>
<p>The effluent from the IWTPPT is pumped to the mixing chamber at the STP, DSN001, and finally discharged by the STP to the common discharge point on seven miles away at Choccolocco Creek. The mixing chamber and the discharge pipe to Choccolocco Creek are not part of the IWTPPT system. **</p>
<p><br /><strong>Installation Description:<br /><br /></strong>Nested in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains in northeast Alabama, Anniston Army Depot (ANAD) occupies over 25 square miles of land, encompassing more than 15,246 acres of woodland and 10 acres of lakes and streams. Possibly the nation's most diversified defense resources - ANAD offers scenic splendor as well as unlimited natural resources.<br />From its origin in 1942 as a storage depot, ANAD has transformed into a state-of-the-market maintenance facility, earning its highly-esteemed reputation as "The Tank Rebuild Center of the World." ANAD is the designated Center of Industrial and Technical Excellence (CITE) for combat vehicles (tracked and wheeled), artillery (self propelled and towed), bridging systems, and small caliber weapons (individual and crew served). ANAD performs depot level maintenance on vehicles ranging in size from the Stryker to the 70 ton M1 Abrams Tank and a variety of other types in between, like the M113 Family of Vehicles, the M88 Recovery Vehicle, and the M9 Armored Combat Engineering vehicle. Major components of each vehicle are also overhauled and returned to stock. ANAD personnel are deployed around the world in direct support of our nation's war fighters providing fielding services and repairs in the field. Combat and battle damage repairs are currently being accomplished both at home and abroad.<br />Under partnership agreements, a wide range of vehicle conversions, upgrades, and new vehicle manufacturing are currently underway. Additionally, worldwide distribution of stocks and the maintenance and storage of conventional ammunition and missiles, as well as the storage of seven percent of the Nation's chemical munitions stockpile (until the stockpile is demilitarized) are significant parts of the depot's overall missions and capabilities. The Department of Defense's only missile recycling center is located at Anniston.<br />Statistics:<br />6,716 Total Employees<br />4,254 Depot Employees<br />$1,151M Operating Budget<br />$680M Average Annual Tennant and Contractor Budget <br />$307M Depot Payroll<br />$1.78B Plant Replacement Value <br />1,770 Buildings/Structures<br />244 Miles of Roadway<br />93 Miles of Fencing<br />42 Miles of Railroad<br />Additional installation information may be located at: <a href="http://www.anad.army.mil/">http://www.anad.army.mil/</a></p>

This is an acquisition for commercial products and services and will be conducted using the guidance in FAR 12, FAR 15 and FAR 36. The applicable NAICS code is 237110, "Water and Sewer Line and related Structure Construction". The small business size standard is $33.5 million. This procurement is being solicited on an unrestricted basis, open to large and small business concerns.
PURPOSE OF the contractSCOPE OF WORK: As part of its capacity building efforts in Iraq, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is working with the Government of Iraq (GOI) to renovate the Iraqi Ministry of Agricultures (IMOA) Al Sewaira Agricultural Research Station, located in Wasit province.   This USDA project is being managed by USDAs Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) and is part of an overall United States Government effort to build capacity in various areas within the Government of Iraq.  USDA is working to build the capacity of the GOI in agricultural research and extension, as well as other agriculture-related subject areas. In a general Letter of Agreement between the USDA and the Iraq Ministry of Agriculture signed March 3, 2011, USDA and the IMOA agreed to collaborate on the renovation of the Al Sewaira Agricultural Research Station.  The Al Sewaira Research Station is located in Wasit province approximately 60 km (35 miles) southeast of Baghdad and covers approximately 150 hectares (375 acres or 625 donums) of fertile land.  It is located approximately 2,150 meters from the Al-Dohan canal, which is its primary source of water for irrigation.  Irrigation water is currently supplied from the canal via an open trench from the Al-Dohan Canal.  The Al Sewaira Research Station was established to conduct research on water management techniques and other aspects of agricultural production.  Its experimental fields are also used for extension purposes.  The major problems facing the Station are inadequate water supply, outdated and inefficient irrigation systems, and blockage of drainage pipes.  The renovation of the Station will improve the supply of irrigation water to the Station and improve the irrigation and drainage system used on the Station in order to improve the agricultural research and extension capacity of the Station.  FAS Office of Agricultural Affairs is located in the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, Iraq and is part of the FAS global network of agricultural economists, marketing experts, negotiators, and other specialists stationed in more than 90 countries to support U.S. agricultural interests.  One of the key objectives of the Agricultural Affairs Office is to develop a regionally competitive and sustainable agricultural and food sector in Iraq.USDA has an Agricultural Counselor stationed at the Embassy who serves as the senior USDA official in Iraq.  Also currently stationed there is a USDA Soil and Water Conservation advisor.  The USDA Agricultural Counselor and the USDA Soil and Water Conservation Advisor, or their designees, will be the contractors USDA points of contact in Iraq.  
The contractor will provide the personnel, labor, supervision, equipment, transportation, and materials needed to fulfill the requirements.  In summary, the contractor shall conduct the renovation of the Al Sewaira Agricultural Research Station in Iraq by:
1)	Confirming to USDA in writing through meetings and site visits, all of the equipment, materials and their specifications needed;

<DESC>PMS401 seeks information from industry entities about their capabilities and interest vis--vis the Common Acoustic Cabinet (CAC) to be procured under a small business set-aside, competitive contract.  The CAC will implement Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) products and non-developmental item(s) (NDI). The CAC contains upgraded signal processing capability and is reconfigurable to support processing of multiple acoustic and array sensors.

 The CAC is one of many MIL-Spec, environmentally qualified, water-cooled cabinets employed by the Acoustic Rapid Commercial Off-the-Shelf Insertion (A-RCI) Program to house submarine sonar acoustic processing capabilities on SSN 688, 688I, SEAWOLF, VA CLASS and SSGN submarines.
   The CAC consists of a series of COTS-based, reconfigurable, high-performance computing servers, high-speed switch technologies, and technologies that power various sonar sensors and monitor cabinet status.  Hardware is refreshed periodically to mitigate obsolescence issues and implement reliability availability and maintainability (RAM) improvements.  
The CAC performs in extreme, submarine-based, operational conditions such as MIL-S 901D (Grade B) shock, MIL-E-461F electromagnetic compatibility,  0oC to 50oC ambient air temperature with a Relative Humidity of 95%,  and MIL-STD-167 vibration environments.  The CAC requires operation for both spray and drip environments at angles up to 45 per MIL-STD-108E.
All interested sources are encouraged to submit company and product literature, white paper, and/or other pertinent information for the Government's consideration.
  Relevant information shall include but is not limited to the criteria listed above. 

All interested sources are encouraged to respond by providing the Government the following information; technical/contractual points of contact, address, telephone and fax numbers, email address, DUNS number, CAGE code and or tax ID number, as well as small business sub-category, a brief summary of the company's capabilities, description of facilities, personnel, related manufacturing experience, and quality assurance process.  Also, provide any supporting information such as commercial literature, catalogues, manuals, etc.  The response should also include all relevant business information, rough order of magnitude (ROM) costs are NOT required.
 

This Request for Information (RFI) in no way implies either implicitly or explicitly that respondents will be compensated in any way by the Government for information or materials provided. 

At the current time, NO FUNDING IS AVAILABLE for contractual efforts.  This request for information (RFI) does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the Government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract in connection with this announcement.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL
FOR AN EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY

1.	Contracting Activity:  

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
Office of Acquisition Operations
Technology Acquisition Center-Austin
1701 Director's Blvd., Suite 600
Austin, TX 78744

2.	Description of Action:  The proposed name brand action is for a firm-fixed-price delivery order issued under the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement (SEWP) IV Government-Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) to satisfy hardware components required at the Austin Information Technology Center (AITC).  This acquisition is for the purchase and installation of 30 Hewlett Packard (HP) servers.  

3.	Description of Supplies and Services:  AITC requires 30 HP DL370G7 SFF CTO servers in the following configuration, part number DL370G7:
a.	Xeon 6C X5690 3.46 Gigahertz (GHz) Dual processors 
b.	12 Megabytes (MB) L3 Cache
c.	Kit for DL380 G7
d.	144 Gigabyte (GB) PC3-10600 DDR3 SDRAM 9x8GB
e.	Four HP 146 GB 15K SAS 6Gb / s DP 2.5" Internal Hard Drives with HP P410/ZM SAS Array Controller
f.	HP Slim 12.7millimeter (mm) SATA DVD Optical Kit
g.	HP NC264T PCI Express Quad Port Gigabit Server Adapter - low profile
h.	HP PCI-E 1x8
i.	2x4 Riser Card
j.	HP StorageWorks 81E PCIe FC HBA Dual Prot (Emulex LPe12000)
k.	Dual HP 750 Watt HE Hot Plug Power Supplies
l.	CTO Avent three year warranty, four hour response time, 24 hours, 7 days per week support
m.	Proliant server DL38X hardware support
n.	CTO WT Installation and start up service

4.	Statutory Authority:  The statutory authority permitting this exception to fair opportunity is 41 U.S.C. 253J(b) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 16.505(b)(2)(i)(B) entitled "Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized."    

5.	Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:    VA technical experts have found that VMware clusters operate at the optimal level when identical hardware platforms are used.  Since HP servers are currently used in the VMware cluster at AITC, additional severs added to the configuration must be HP brand name.  HP brand servers paired with the existing HP server infrastructure reduces all compatibility and technical risks.  HP servers eliminate the risk of interoperability failures.  All controllable risk mitigation efforts must be taken to prevent any potential failures in the AITC environment because the equipment will be used to provide Veterans nationwide with access to the Identity and Access Management (IAM) system for authentication.  Interoperability problems between different brand name servers may cause a server outage at AITC resulting in a significant negative impact on Veterans' access to VA systems; therefore the risk of a server outage must be mitigated to the lowest possible level by ensuring the same HP brand servers are used within the VMware cluster.
	
6.	Efforts to Obtain Competition:  Market research was conducted, details of which are in the market research section of this document.  Although the Government is limiting competition as a result of specifying a brand name item, there are authorized resellers of these products on the NASA SEWP IV GWAC contract.  Competition for this requirement among Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Businesses (SDVOSB) (Group B) vendors is anticipated.  Any quotation received will be evaluated.  Furthermore, in accordance with FAR 5.202(a)(6), this effort is exempt from pre-award synopsis since the proposed contract action is an order placed under an existing Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract.  However, in accordance with FAR 5.301 and 16.505(b)(2), this action will be synopsized at award on the Federal Business Opportunities Page (FBO) and the justification will be made publicly available.  

7.	Actions to Increase Competition:  Where possible, solicitations for future requirements will utilize "brand name or equal" language, if it is in the Government's best interest to do so.  In addition, in order to remove or overcome barriers to competition in future acquisitions for this requirement, the agency will work with the program office to perform additional market research so that other solutions can be considered.  

8.	Market Research:  Market research was conducted by the Government's technical experts who determined that in the interest of minimizing technical risks and maximizing efficiency any newly procured servers should match the existing brand of servers presently being used.  Market research indicated that a different brand name server installed within the VMware cluster may cause interoperability issues, further resulting in the system being unavailable.  Because the NASA SEWP IV GWAC is a required source of supplies for VA, market research was conducted by using the look-up tool which indicated that six potential SDVOSB vendors in Group B that could submit quotes for this procurement.  This will allow for some degree of competition, as multiple vendors will have the ability to submit competitive quotes for the HP servers.    

9.	Other Facts:  Purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed because the brand name requirement is necessary in order to ensure the system is available to Veterans and no interoperability issues arise.

<DESC>SUBJECT: Brand Name justification for the Navigation Laboratories, Inc. LabMate 14 Channel L1 C/A Code GPS Simulator with LCD monitor. This brand name justification supports an acquisition of a GPS constellation simulator - the Navigation Laboratories, Inc. LabMate 14 channel L1 C/A code GPS simulator. The configuration includes an LCD monitor, software, and corresponding accessories. The software to be included is a Windows operating system and all software for operation of the GPS simulator boards that are installed inside the PC. The associated accessories include a USB mouse, a backup hard drive, a keyboard, and standard 115 volt power cables for the monitor and GPS simulator. The GPS simulator is proprietary to GPS Creations, the only known distributor for the Navigation Laboratories, Inc. LabMate 14 channel L1 C/A code GPS simulator. DMEA is replicating the GPS test platform of a specific customer with the purchase of the specific brand and equipment described above, but the equipment will be exercised for various projects to build field scenarios. Market research was conducted and several vendors were found with different platforms. However, to reproduce the test plans and built scenarios for 2 current projects in a different platform will cost an estimated $36,800 based on 320 engineering hours at $115 per hour. By replicating the GPS test platform of the customer, test plans and built scenarios provided by the customer can be utilized while saving costs and maintaining the integrity of the test plans and built scenarios. The following vendor is the only source who can satisfy the Government's requirement for equipment described above: GPS Creations, P.O. Box 381272, Germantown, TN 38183.
