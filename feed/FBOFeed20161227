<DESC><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) anticipates a requirement to create new theoretical models and simulation tools critical to the rapid and cost-effective development of new Vacuum Electronics (VE) and other devices to meet the needs of the Navy and the DoD. The scope of this work includes theoretical and experimental VE research required to create new simulation tools; maintain and/or expand the functionality of existing/developmental NRL design codes; and create or analyze novel passive and active device designs. The work includes but is not limited to the development of new theory and improved algorithms; the implementation of algorithms into existing and developing NRL codes; the testing and validation of predictions from the improved codes against measured data and/or other codes; and the development and analysis of new VE designs. Computational approaches of interest include 2D/3D particle-in-cell (PIC) codes; physics-based parametric and hybrid approaches; and run-time acceleration using graphics processing units (GPUs). A key goal of this research is to develop a suite of integrated, user-friendly design tools that will reduce the time and cost of VE device development for the Navy/DoD.<br /><br />
<p>The contractor will be required to conduct research resulting in the development of computationally efficient, accurate simulation tools; validate the tools' performance through comparison with experimental data and the results of other codes; and create and/or analyze the performance of VE device related passive and active components to be integrated into DoD sub-systems and systems. The research will include but not be limited to theoretical analysis and development of computationally efficient models and algorithms for beam-wave interaction in various VE or plasma-filled devices; formation and transport of electron beams; and effects of different materials including meta-materials on device and passive and active component performance. The models and algorithms developed under this work will be implemented in existing and developing NRL codes and/or stand-alone computer codes capable of the automatic exchange of input/output data with other NRL codes without user intervention.<br /><br />The Contractor shall conduct research in the following five major task areas;</p>
<p>(1) Theoretical Analysis and Development of Algorithms and Computational Models;<br />(2) Implementation of Algorithms and Models and their Verification and Validation;<br />(3) Application of Algorithms and Models;<br />(4) Experimental Data Collection for Model Validation;<br />(5) Code Support and Maintenance</p>

NASA would like to know that there is a path to production and man-rating of the partial pressure suit up to 65,000 feet. Minimal changes to the Combined High Altitude and anti-G Suit system would be preferable to limit the required ground and flight testing and thus reduce cost. NASA desires to have a few adjustable common sizes available for various aircrew, so that specific suits are not required for each crewmember. <br /><br />Potential sources shall provide documentation that demonstrates their technical knowledge and capability to meet the partial pressure suit support requirements. Documentation shall be no more than 20 pages total. In determining page counts, a page is defined as one side of a sheet, 8 1/2" x 11", with at least one inch margins on all sides, using not smaller than 12-point type.

WFIRST is envisioning the use of reaction wheels, control moment gyros, or combinations of both options.</p>
<p>Briefly, WFIRST is a NASA observatory designed to perform Wide Field imaging and surveys of the near infrared sky.  WFIRST is a 6.5 year mission (with a 10 year goal), currently targeted to launch in 2025 and will be in orbit at the Sun-Earth L2 point.</p>
<p>In addition, WFIRST has three primary survey campaigns (High Latitude Survery, Microlensing, and Supernovae) where an agile observatory is required. The high torque actuator need is driven in general by science survey profiles and in particular by the microlensing slew profile.  More general background information is available online in section 3.10 of the WFIRST Science Definition Team 2015 Report, http://wfirst.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/sdt_public/WFIRST-AFTA_SDT_Report_150310_Final.pdf .</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to survey vendor capabilities to meet the WFIRST mission requirements. This request is for information and planning purposes and feasibility of the requirements.</p>
<p>While our intent may be to team with an industry partner(s), we are not bound by this RFI to do so. This is not a Request for Proposal, nor a Request for Quotation, nor an Invitation to Bid. Therefore, this RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract nor will the Government pay for information provided in response to this RFI.</p>
<p>To consolidate our planning, responses from industry are requested by January 30, 2017, in the form of written and illustrated concepts, estimates for development costs and schedule, assumptions used for cost and schedule estimates design assumptions, and descriptions of capabilities. Responses can be submitted via email. The email text must give a point-of-contact and provide his/her name, address, telephone/fax numbers, and email address. The information is requested for planning purposes only, subject to FAR Clause 52.215-3, entitled "Solicitation for Information for Planning Purposes."</p>
<p>It is not NASA's intent to publicly disclose vendor proprietary information obtained during this solicitation. To the full extent that it is protected pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act and other laws and regulations, information identified by a respondent as "Proprietary or Confidential" will be kept confidential.</p>
<p>No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps.  It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.</p>
<p>Technical or procurement questions should be directed to the contacts below.</p>
<p>Interested offeror's shall address the requirements of this RFI in written format as described in the previous paragraphs by electronic mail to the contacts below no later than January 30, 2017.</p>
<p>In addition, please let the contacts below know if you are interested in responding to this RFI prior to the deadline.  Notification of interest will allow us to provide updated/revised information to the requirements below.Specifications and Questions<br />Our microlensing survey drives the actuator requirement. As a result, high level requirements are system level torque capability of 1.53 Nm in the body Y-Z plane. For Momentum capacity, we need about &plusmn; 75 Nms along the body Y-axis, plus 30 Nms headroom in any direction for slew momentum. The momentum storage capacity needs to be held in the wheels with wheel speeds below 40 Hz (2400 rpm) for jitter avoidance.</p>
<p>1.	Reaction Wheels<br />a.	Torque Capability:  &gt; 0.65 Nm (up to 1.5 Nm, or as close as is feasible)<br />b.	Momentum Capacity:  50 Nms (@3000 rpm or less)</p>
<p><br />2.	Control Moment Gyro<br />a.	Minimum Output Torque:  &lt; 0.005 Nm<br />b.	Output Torque: 2-5 Nm<br />c.	Momentum: &gt;= 220 Nms for system (~ 75 Nms per flywheel if assuming singularity-free envelope)<br />d.	Single Fault Tolerant</p>

<p>6.	Induced Vibration<br />a.	Static and Dynamic Imbalances<br />b.	Samples of induced vibration measurements (preferably in electronic format)</p>
<p>7.	Radiation Requirement<br />a.	Meet the radiation environment of an Earth-Sun-L2 Orbit.</p>
<p>8.	Thermal<br />a.	Are there any thermal requirements that need to be met by WFIRST to support the actuator?<br />b.	Estimated heat dissipation from reaction wheel and drive electronics.</p>
<p>9.	Power<br />a.	The observatory will supply switched power from 21V to 35V.  What would be the peak and steady-state power estimate at rated momentum capacity for the actuator?</p>
<p>10.	Design Lifetime<br />a.	Can the actuator meet the expected mission lifetime of 6.5 years with a pre-launch life of at least 4 years?</p>
<p>11.	Quality Assurance Program<br />a.	Please provide the quality assurance program with the proposed solution.</p>
<p>12.	Cost and Schedule<br />a.	Please provide a cost estimate for the delivery of 1 Flight Unit and 1 Engineering Test Unit (ETU) and any cost savings for multiple actuators.<br />b.	Please provide a schedule for the delivery of 1 Flight Unit and 1 ETU and for multiple actuators.</p>

This is NOT a Request for Proposals (RFP), and nothing shall be construed herein or through the Sources Sought process to commit or obligate the Government to further action.

The submission of capability information in response to this market survey is purely voluntary.
<p>The Office of Justice Programs (OJP), Office for Civil Rights (OCR), United States Department of Justice (DOJ) ensures that recipients of federal financial assistance from OJP, the Office on Violence Against Women (OVW), and the Office of Community Oriented Policing (COPS) comply with civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination in both recipients' delivery of services or benefits and employment. The OCR exercises its enforcement authority by both investigating complaints from the public and initiating affirmative reviews to ensure that recipients do not use federal funds in an unlawful discriminatory manner. As part of its efforts to address prohibited discrimination, the OCR is undertaking a series of reviews to evaluate whether the funded recipients' imposition of monetary penalties by levying fees and fines has an unlawful disparate impact. The OCR is also in the process of addressing complaints that allege that certain recipients set bail in a manner that has an unlawful discriminatory impact.</p>
<p>Concurrently, the OCR is reviewing the recruitment, hiring, retention, and promotion policies, procedures, and practices of law enforcement agencies and other recipients of federal financial assistance ("recipients") to determine whether they adversely impact applicants and employees of certain protected classes.</p>
<p>To assist the OCR in conducting these reviews, it needs to consult with various subject-matter experts, specifically experts skilled in statistical analysis of employment data.</p>
<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to these proposed services is 541611. The anticipated contract type is Time &amp; Material. The anticipated period of performance is a base year plus one (1) option year commencing March 1, 2017. The anticipated place of performance will include some on-site work at OCR at 810 7th Street NW, Washington DC 20001, as well as the Contractor's site and field locations.</p>

<DESC>Synoposis:<br />U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) in January.
<p>HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.secure.force.com/AAAP. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects.  The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'.  Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides are offered in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.</p>
<p>The Open Period for January is January 1, 2016 to January 20, 2016, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.  The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement.  The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements.  Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.secure.force.com/AAAP).  Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website.  During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.</p>
<p>This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program through the remainder of FY 2017 or until it is replaced.</p>
<p>If you have previously submitted an offer, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the new RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually.   <br /> <br />OCCUPANCY: Space offered must be vacant and ready for commencement of tenant alterations within 60 days of this notice.<br /> <br />DELINEATED AREA:  Delaware, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and certain counties in New Jersey, Maryland, and Virginia</p>
<p>Delineated areas are clarified further in the RLP posted on the AAAP website and may be restricted further when specific space requirements are developed.<br /> <br />LEASE TERM:  Up to 15 years.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) proposes to negotiate a non-competitive modification with the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations (INPO), 700 Galleria Parkway, Atlanta, GA&nbsp; 30339,&nbsp;under NRC Contract No. NRC-HQ-12-C-04-0068 entitled "Computer access to INPO's Equipment Performance and Information Exchange (EPIX) System." The EPIX system has been renamed the INPO Consolidated Event System (ICES). The current period of performance of this contract is May 2, 2012 through January 1, 2017. The purpose of this modification is to extend the period of performance of the contract through April 1, 2017 to provide the NRC with continued access to INPO's ICES system database, manuals, and associated support services while a follow-on contract is being processed. The firm fixed price for this proposed three-month extension is $94,722.45, which will increase the total ceiling of the contract from $1,751,890.51 to $1,846,612.96. <br />
<p>Specifically, INPO will be required to continue to&nbsp;provide computer access to the ICES, the associated training and support services, and copies of the ICES component data. ICES is a web-based database that provides information on components important to nuclear plant safety and reliability. ICES was developed to meet current and projected industry needs for component-level information exchange and to replace the Nuclear Plant Reliability Data System (NPRDS). ICES also provides access to the retrieval of data reported to NPRDS from January 1973 through December 1996. ICES is a proprietary database managed by INPO for exclusive use by its member organizations. The NRC has confirmed that the ECIS is currently only available from INPO.</p>

<DESC>The USDA National Animal Disease Center in Ames, IA, intends to award a procurement of 31 Bison heifers to Timber Ridge Bison. This animal procurement will be conducted in accordance with the procedures in FAR Part 13.106. The purchase determination is based on previous vaccine experiments that have utilized bison obtained from this source. Obtaining bison from a different source may introduce new variables to the ongoing experiences that may lead to increased variability in immune responses and impair comparison of vaccine responses across experiments. This herd has been verified free of malignant catarrhal fever (MCF), a significant cause of mortality in many bison herds. Currently available diagnostics lack the sensitivity and specificity to detect infected herds or individuals. Purchase of bison with MCF would make all data from the proposed experiment invalid and non-publishable. Of equal concern would be the possibility that MCF could be inadvertently introduced into bison in other experiments (i.e. deer) at NADC; a scenario that would be devastating to several ongoing brucellosis, tuberculosis and possibly prior research projects. Least cost procurement of bison on a previous occasion did result in procurement of MCF-positive bison. This vendor maintains our bison genetic needs at an agreeable travel distance to ensure safe, healthy travel for animal delivery. This project is anticipated required delivery by January 27, 2017. The cost has been determined fair and reasonable based on current technical knowledge of fair market value. The anticipated purchase order value is $69938.00.
<p>This is not a request for quotation. However, all interested parties may contact the Contract Specialist listed below. Sources interested in responding to this requirement must be able to provide compelling evidence that they can obtain/provide the required animals. Responses must be submitted electronically, via email, to lara.j.hicok@aphis.usda.gov. The deadline for the submittal of responses is 1:00 pm CST, January 13, 2017.</p>

<p>Issue Date 27 December 2016 - Closing Date 12 January 2017 - Time 12:00PM EST</p>
<p>This is a Sources Sought announcement; market survey for information only, to be used for preliminary planning purposes. No proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS. There is no formal solicitation at this time. This effort will be conducted on a sole source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. The basis for restricting competition is that the time and duplication of cost to develop the supplies, services, and repairs make it impractical to procure from a contractor other than Herley Industries, Inc.</p>
<p>At the current time, NO FUNDING IS AVAILABLE for contractual efforts. This Sources Sought does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the Government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract. The U.S. Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement. Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement or incurred for participation in the Market Survey will NOT be reimbursed. All information marked as proprietary information will be safeguarded to prevent disclosures to non-Government personnel and entities.</p>
<p>The Crane Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center is seeking prospective sources to procure supplies, services, and repairs in support of the AN/ALQ-218 Tactical Jamming Receiver System (TJRS) and AN/ALQ-240 Electronic Support Measures System (ESM) systems. The procurement actions consist of assemblies, subassemblies, components, engineering, technical, and logistical support, repairs, and documentation and data associated with the Herley products contained on the AN/ALQ-218 and AN/ALQ-240 systems.</p>
<p>In accordance with Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) Procedures, Guidance, and Information (PGI) 206.302-1, the Government is accepting information from companies potentially capable of meeting the requirements as described above. Companies with the capabilities and facilities that would enable them to meet the Government's requirements may respond. Responses shall address how the respondent proposes to develop the aforementioned products without the Herley Industries, Inc. proprietary data. This is not an item development announcement. Any duplication of costs for item development including hardware, Government testing, qualification and validation will be at the contractor's expense. The Government has estimated the cost of developing replacements for the products is estimated at $10.8M. The Government does not own a Level III Technical Data Package.</p>
<p>All interested parties may submit company and product literature, a white paper no longer than 5 pages, and/or other pertinent information, such as a description with performance parameters and a statement of current availability, summary of prior testing, test reports, a budgetary estimate of test articles, and an explanation as to why the Government should not procure this effort on a sole source basis as stated above given the requirement to have access to Herley Industries, Inc. proprietary data to meet the requirement.</p>
<p>Response to the Market Survey shall include the following:</p>
<p>Submitter's Name <br />Street Address, City, State, Zip Code<br />Business Size<br />Point of Contact (POC)<br />POC Telephone<br />Anticipated Solicitation Number: N000164-17-R-WS09</p>
<p>Please include the purpose/explanation of the response to the Market Survey, i.e. to better understand the Government requirements; to potentially become a viable source for future requirements; to take exception to the anticipated sole source as your company currently meets all of the Governments requirements and can successfully offset the projected cost duplication and schedule delays. The Government may contact Sources Sought respondents to get clarification on the information submitted.</p>
<p>Contractors must be properly registered in the Government System for Award Management database (SAM). Contractors may obtain information on SAM registration and annual confirmation of requirements by calling 1-866-606-8220, or via the internet at www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>Respondents please submit any applicable product literature, features, general specification, performance specifications, qualification and test date, rough order of magnitude pricing, current applications, lead time of the solution, point of contact (POC), and related information on or before 12 January 17 to the following address: Commander, NAVSURFWARCENDIV Crane, Code 0242, Bldg 121, Attn: Jordan Black, 300 Highway 361 Crane, IN 47522-5001. POC is Jordan Black Phone 812-854-3857e-mail jordan.black@navy.mil .<br /><br />Responses to this Sources Sought may be emailed to the POC above.</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c) (1) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

1.4.1. Purpose. To aid in ensuring that:
1.4.1.2 The Contractor does not obtain an unfair competitive advantage by establishing the ground rules
for a future competition;
1.4.1.3. The Contractor's objectivity and judgment are not biased because of its present or future interests
(financial, contractual, organizational, or otherwise) which relate to work performed under this contract;
and
1.4.1.4. The Contractor does not obtain an unfair competitive advantage by virtue of its access to nonpublic
or proprietary information belonging to others.
1.4.1.5. Definitions.
1.4.1.6. The term Contractor herein used in section 1.6.16., Organizational Conflict of Interest, means:
(a) the organization (hereinafter referred to as "it" or "its") entering into this agreement with the
Government; (b) all business organizations with which it may merge, join or affiliate now or in the future
and in any manner whatsoever, or which hold or may obtain, by purchase or otherwise, direct or indirect
control of it; (c) its parent organization, if any and any of its present or future subsidiaries, associates,
affiliates, or holding companies, and; (d) any organization or enterprise over which it has direct or indirect
control now or in the future.
1.4.1.7. The term "proprietary information" for purposes of section 1.6.16., Organizational Conflict of
Interest, means any information considered so valuable by its owners that it is held secret by them and
their licensees. Information furnished voluntarily by the owner without limitations on its use, or which is
available without restrictions from other sources, is not considered proprietary.
1.4.1.8. Organizational Conflicts of Interest Examples. The following examples illustrate situations in
which organizational conflicts of interest may arise. These examples are not all inclusive.
1.4.1.9. Biased Ground Rules. This type of conflict may arise in situations where a company sets the
ground rules for a future competition. For example, when a Contractor develops requirements then
competes to provide products or services to satisfy those requirements, thus obtaining a competitive
advantage.
1.4.1.11 Impaired Objectivity. This type of conflict may exist where a Contractors obligations under a
contract require objectivity, but another role of the Contractor casts doubt on its ability to be truly
objective. An example of this type of conflict is where a Contractors work under one contract entails
evaluating itself, its affiliates, or its competitors under a separate contract.
1.4.1.12 Unequal Access to Information. This type of conflict may arise when a Contractor has access to
nonpublic or proprietary information as part of its performance under a contract that gives it an unfair
advantage in a competition for a later contract.

Conflicts of Interest, concerning organizational conflicts of interest govern this contract. Potential
conflicts may exist in accordance with FAR 9.505-1, Providing Systems Engineering and Technical
Direction, through 9.505-4, Obtaining Access to Proprietary Information. In this regard, the Contractor is
responsible for identifying any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest to the KO that arise
as the result of performance under this contract. To avoid or mitigate a potential conflict related to
performance under this contract, the KO will impose appropriate constraints such as the constraints
discussed below. Since it is impossible to foresee all of the circumstances that might give rise to
organizational conflicts of interest, the constraints discussed below are not all inclusive and the KO may
impose constraints other than, or in addition to, the constraints listed below.
1.4.1.14 The Contractor agrees that if it provides, under a contract or task order or delivery order, systems
engineering and technical guidance for systems and programs, but does not have overall contractual
responsibility, it will not be allowed to be awarded a contract or task or delivery order to supply the
system or any of its major components or be a subcontractor or consultant to a supplier of the system or
any of its major components (FAR 9.505-1).
1.4.1.15 The Contractor agrees that if it prepares complete specifications for non-developmental items or
assists in the preparation of work statements for a system or services under a contract or task order or
delivery order, it will not be allowed to furnish these items, either as a prime Contractor, a subcontractor
or as a consultant (FAR 9.505-2).
1.4.1.16. The Contractor agrees that it will neither evaluate nor advise the Government with regard to its
own products or activities. The Contractor will objectively evaluate or advise the Government
concerning products or activities of any prospective competitors (FAR 9.505-3).

conflict of interest after award of this contract, a prompt and full disclosure shall be made in writing to the
KO. This disclosure shall include a description of the action the Contractor has taken or proposes to take
in order to avoid or mitigate such conflict.

Customer Input
Acceptable surveillance methods include:
&#61692; 100 Percent Inspection With this method, performance is inspected/evaluated at each occurrence. This method is often costly but
can be necessary due to health, safety and other considerations.
&#61692; Random Sampling Random sampling works best when the number of instances of the services being performed is very large and
a statistically valid sample can be obtained.
&#61692; Periodic Inspection. This method, sometimes called planned sampling, consists planned sampling at specific dates or time
intervals. It may be appropriate for tasks that occur infrequently, and where 100 percent inspection or random testing is not desired.
&#61692; Customer Input. Although usually not a primary method, this is a valuable supplement to more systematic methods. For example,
in a case where random sampling indicates unsatisfactory service, customer complaints can be used as substantiating evidence. In
certain situations where customers can be relied upon to complain consistently when the quality of performance is poor, e.g., dining
facilities, building services, customer surveys and customer complaints may be a primary surveillance method, and customer
satisfaction an appropriate performance standard. In all cases, complaints should be documented, preferably on a standard form.

(t) System for Award Management (SAM). (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <BR> <BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of Payment? paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <BR> <BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ``I agree'' click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ``click-wrap'' or ``browse-wrap'' agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u) (1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. (v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor's representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract. <BR> <BR>(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: (1) 52.209-10, Prohibition on Contracting with Inverted Domestic Corporations (Nov 2015).

DFARS Clause 252.204-7000: Disclosure of Information (August 2013) <BR> <BR>FedBid is NOT a forum for filing protests against the Government. Attempts to file protests through FedBid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). It is preferable that protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. To be timely, protests shall be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. 1) All agency-level protests should be sent to the Contracting Officer for resolution. 2) The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road RM: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil 
No protest under FAR Subpart 33.1 is authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of an order under a task-order contract or delivery-order contract, except for:
(1) A protest on the grounds that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract; or (2) A protest of an order valued in excess of $10M. Protests of orders in excess of $10M may only be filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in accordance with the procedures at 33.104.
The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a)(10)(i)(B) of this section expires on September 30, 2016, for agencies other than DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard (41 U.S.C. 4103(d) and 41 U.S.C. 4106(f)). The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a) (10)(i)(B) of this section does not expire for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard.
AFARS 5116.5(b) (c) Each HCA shall designate a task and delivery order ombudsman for the contracting activity. The ombudsman shall be a senior official, who is independent of the Contracting Officer and may be the Special Competition Advocate. The ombudsman shall be responsible for reviewing complaints from the contractors under multiple award task or delivery order contracts and ensuring that all the contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered, consistent with the procedures in the contract.
Summarize: the ombudsman will only determine if the government gave fair opportunity to a vendor who files a complaint. [AFARS Revision #25, Item XIII, dated April 1, 2010] <BR> <BR>IAW 52.212-1(g Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids) The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror?s initial offer should contain the offeror?s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. <BR> <BR>Please contact the following for any concerns regarding the solicitation and/or award of this requirement: Ronald Kabat Contracting Officer MICC - Fort Riley Com: (785) 239-9630 Email: Ronald.l.kabat.civ@mail.mil <BR> <BR>Under FAR Part 12 Streamlined Procedures for Commercial Acquisitions, a debrief is not required. The Government will not offer a debrief for this requirement. <BR> <BR>Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is ?late? and may not be considered IAW with 52.212-1(f). At any time during and/or closing of the solicitation, all clarifications, discussions, or changes (as applicable) will be conducted ONLY by the Contracting Officer, MICC Fort Riley, Kansas. Any correspondence (electronic or verbal) presented to the vendor marketplace during the solicitation period by the FEDBID Staff, to include Quality Assurance, will be rejected by the Contracting Officer. No FEBBID correspondence will be accepted by MICC Fort Riley without prior coordination and approval from the Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured or "gray market" items. All items must be covered by the manufacturer's warranty. <BR> <BR>

Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>

The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope.

For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage.

The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.

Flow down required in accordance with paragraph (d) of FAR clause 52.247-64. <BR> <BR>The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. (d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. <BR> <BR>(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>(a) An agency protest may be filed with either: (1) The contracting officer, or (2) at a level above the contracting officer, with the appropriate agency Protest Decision Authority.

Hoover Building, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230. FAX: (202) 482-5858. <BR> <BR>(a) A protest may be filed with either the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or the Court of Federal Claims unless an agency protest has been filed. (b) A complete copy of all GAO or Court of Federal Claims protests, including all attachments, shall be served upon (i) the Contracting Officer, and (ii) the Contract Law Division of the Office of the General Counsel, within one day of filing a protest with either GAO or the Court of Federal Claims. (c) Service upon the Contract Law Division shall be made as follows: U.S. Department of Commerce, Office of the General Counsel, Chief, Contract Law Division, Room 5893, Herbert C.

(2) The Sponsor will ensure that these forms have been properly completed, initiate the CD-254, Contract Security Classification Specification, and forward the documents to the cognizant Security Officer. (3) Upon completion of security processing, the Office of Security, through the servicing Security Officer and the Sponsor, will notify the contractor in writing of an individual's eligibility to be provided access to a Department of Commerce facility or Department of Commerce IT system. (4) Security processing shall consist of limited personal background inquiries pertaining to verification of name, physical description, marital status, present and former residences, education, employment history, criminal record, personal references, medical fitness, fingerprint classification, and other pertinent information. For non-U.S. citizens, the Sponsor must request an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency check.

(f) Failure to comply with security processing requirements may result in termination of the contract or removal of contract employees from Department of Commerce facilities or denial of access to IT systems. (g) Access to National Security Information. Compliance with these requirements shall not be construed as providing a contract employee clearance to have access to national security information. (h) The contractor shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph, in all subcontracts. <BR> <BR>(a) Except as stated in paragraph (b) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (1) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (2) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ?I agree? click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ?click-wrap? or ?browse-wrap? agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (3) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.

(1) Technical approach; (2) past performance; and (3) price, with the non-price factors being significantly more important than price. Because of the developmental work required, and the greater the performance risk, technical and past performance considerations will play a dominant role in source selection.

Additional task orders will be awarded on the IDA-E contracts as they are identified and programmed. The projects listed below are representative of the type of projects contractors should expect. The intent is to award each of these projects on this Indefinite Delivery Architect-Engineer contract (IDA-E). The following is a brief scope for each of these projects: </span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Buskin Beach, Kodiak<br />Buskin Beach is located in the Kodiak Island Borough, near the Kodiak Airport and Buskin River. Soil and groundwater are contaminated with a mixture of Bunker C and heating oil, deposited during WWII.</span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The scope-of-work involves evaluating and presenting existing chemical and hydrogeologic data to assess groundwater flow. This analysis will be used to formulate a conceptual site model for the site. Additionally, three samples each of groundwater and product will be collected and analyzed for volatile petroleum hydrocarbons (VPH) and extractable petroleum hydrocarbons (EPH), to determine the aromatic, aliphatic and polar compound concentrations in the NAPL and groundwater. These data will be used to assess dissolved phase migration downgradient of the source area toward the Buskin River using a model to characterize fate and transport of contaminants through time and potential ecological risk to the Buskin River. The fate and transport calculations will be compared to previously-measured concentrations in the downgradient monitoring wells. Additionally, an effort will be undertaken to delineate the eastern edge of the boundary of the plume. 12 borings will be advanced in this effort. Two soil samples, one from near the water table and one from the vadose zone, will be collected from each boring and analyzed for diesel range organics (DRO) and residual range organics (RRO) via ADEC methods AK102 and AK103. Four of the borings will be completed as monitoring wells. One groundwater sample will be collected from each of the four wells and analyzed for DRO and RRO via methods AK102 and AK103. Groundwater samples will also be evaluated for Total Aromatic Hydrocarbons (TAH, or BTEX) and Total Aqueous Hydrocarbons (TAqH, or BTEX + Polynuclear Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs)) by analyzing via EPA Method Methods 8021B or 8260B to quantify monoaromatic hydrocarbons and to measure TAH; and EPA method Methods 8270C (including SIMS) or 8310 for the list of 16 Polynuclear Aromatic Hydrocarbons listed by EPA Method 610. All locations of borings and samples will be surveyed for horizontal coordinates only.</span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Deliverables are a pre-draft, draft and final work plan, to include a sampling and analysis plan, site safety and health plan and contractor quality control plan, and pre-draft, draft and final report. In accordance with the Manual for Electronic Deliverables (MED). </span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CANOL Pipeline<br />The CANOL pipeline extends for 605 miles from Whitehorse, Canada, to Fairbanks, Alaska. About 296 miles of the pipeline are in Alaska. The pipeline located in Canada is not eligible for DERP-FUDS funding. Along the 296 miles of pipeline, there are 1,079 tracts of land, owned by approximately 444 landowners. The CANOL project consists of the former pipeline right of way, possible dumps, staging areas and camps associated with construction of the pipeline; and valves, pump stations and maintenance facilities associated with operation of the pipeline. Operation of the CANOL pipeline ended in 1955, and since then much of the pipeline and associated facilities have been removed or demolished by contractors working for the Federal government or private individuals acting on their own. Fuel leaks and spills from operation of the pipeline may pose a risk to local residents. Contaminant sources include pipeline appurtenances associated with fuel storage and distribution, as well as sources associated with ancillary service of the CANOL pipeline (personnel camps and infrastructure, 55-gallon drums, oil cans, miscellaneous debris). Suspected contaminated media includes soil (surface and subsurface), groundwater, surface water, and sediment.</span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The scope will include preparing planning documents, evaluating the nature and extent of contamination, reporting, and the associated project management. Media to be sampled and order of magnitude will vary by site, but will include soil, groundwater, surface water, and/or sediment. General fieldwork, sampling methodology, frequency, and standards shall conform to ADEC guidance documents, 18 AAC 75, 18 AAC 78, and ADEC UST procedures manual. Direct push and hollow-stem drilling methods typically achieve necessary soil sampling and groundwater well requirements, although air-rotary capabilities may be necessary in extreme cases. Typical contaminants of concern (COCs) include gasoline ranges organics (GRO), DRO, RRO, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs), and RCRA metals. Additional analytes may include ethylene dibromide (EDB), dichloroethane (DCA), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB). Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Program (ELAP) certification will be required for all appropriate analytical methods. Appropriate detection limits, limits of detection, and limits of quantitation to evaluate ADEC promulgated cleanup levels will be required. Analyses of historical documents, georeferencing of as-built drawings and historical photos necessary to locate sites and site features may be required. Coordination with SHPO for permitting may be required. GPS capabilities that adhere to the requirements of the MED are necessary. Geophysics may be required to locate subsurface site features and/or utilities.</span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">All deliverables are required to conform to the standards and specifications outlined in the MED, as well as ADEC Site Characterization Work Plan and Reporting Guidance. Deliverables will include draft and final work plans, updated ecological and human health conceptual site models and draft and final Site Investigation reports. Organizing and leading public meetings to inform local communities about proposed field efforts and incorporate public concerns into planning/reporting documents and the field efforts themselves is required. Meeting requirements typically include adequate advertising of the meeting to the local community, capacity to accommodate up to 20 meeting attendees, handicapped/disabled accessibility, teleconferencing capability, and multimedia presentation capability.</span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fort Morrow<br />Additional RI work is required at the former Fort Morrow Army Post, located at Port Heiden, Alaska. Under the Formerly Used Defense Sites Program, the former Fort Morrow is eligible for environmental restoration funding. A remedial investigation is required under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act prior to performing extensive remediation activities. A contractor conducted remedial activities between 2011 and 2015, and submitted a Final Phase II Remedial Investigation Report in November 2016. Additional investigation will be required to fully characterize the site.<br />Closure of the Fort in 1945 resulted in the documented abandonment of thousands of drums of aviation fuel, petroleum, oil, lubricants, and other maintenance fluids. As a result of RI activities performed to date, the former Fort Morrow was divided into 13 Areas of Concern (AOCs), A through M, based on military activities that occurred within each area. A total of 195 features were screened for petroleum, oil, and lubricant (POL) contamination between AOC B (21 features), AOC M (171 features), AOC E (one feature), and AOC F (two features).</span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data gaps remain and additional soil and groundwater samples will be required to fill these gaps. Additional RI work will include surface and subsurface soil sampling (up to 100 samples) and the installation and sampling of additional monitoring wells (up to six). It is possible that additional geophysical surveys may need to be conducted (three areas) with subsequent test pits dug (up to two per survey area). Anticipated deliverables include a draft and final UFP-QAPP, Health and Safety Plan, project Fact Sheets, and draft and final reports in compliance with the MED. The contractor will host a public meeting in Port Heiden to present the status of the RI. The contractor will compare existing data from previous RI work against applicable cleanup levels.</span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Eklutna Army Site<br />The Eklutna Army Site is located 26 miles northeast of Anchorage, Alaska. The site was used by the United States Army as a suspected supply and storage area from 1957 to 1971. Widespread chlorinated solvent contamination has been identified in the site soils and groundwater. Hydrogeology at the site is extremely complex due to the Eklutna River, Chugach Mountains, and Cook Inlet. The Phase III RI will include the installation of additional groundwater monitoring wells, a tidal influence study, groundwater modelling, additional soil gas and sediment sampling, and a complete human health and ecological risk assessment that evaluates all likely future land use scenarios.</span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The field portion of the Phase III RI will include the installation and sampling of 25 monitoring wells. Some wells will extend to more than 150 feet bgs. The Contractor will also collect approximately 10 sediment samples and 25 soil gas samples that will be used to support the risk assessment. The tidal study will be complex and likely include evaluating tidal influences on 10 monitoring wells. Deliverables from the Phase III RI will include an RI work plan, risk assessment work plan, RI report, and Risk assessment Report prepared according to the MED.<br /></span></em></strong><br /><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Table 1 shows the anticipated workload that the IDA-E contracts will support. </span></em></strong></p>

Additional task orders will be awarded on the IDA-E contracts as they are identified and programmed. The projects listed below are representative of the type of projects contractors should expect. The intent is to award each of these projects on this Indefinite Delivery Architect-Engineer contract (IDA-E). The following is a brief scope for each of these projects: </span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Buskin Beach, Kodiak<br />Buskin Beach is located in the Kodiak Island Borough, near the Kodiak Airport and Buskin River. Soil and groundwater are contaminated with a mixture of Bunker C and heating oil, deposited during WWII.</span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The scope-of-work involves evaluating and presenting existing chemical and hydrogeologic data to assess groundwater flow. This analysis will be used to formulate a conceptual site model for the site. Additionally, three samples each of groundwater and product will be collected and analyzed for volatile petroleum hydrocarbons (VPH) and extractable petroleum hydrocarbons (EPH), to determine the aromatic, aliphatic and polar compound concentrations in the NAPL and groundwater. These data will be used to assess dissolved phase migration downgradient of the source area toward the Buskin River using a model to characterize fate and transport of contaminants through time and potential ecological risk to the Buskin River. The fate and transport calculations will be compared to previously-measured concentrations in the downgradient monitoring wells. Additionally, an effort will be undertaken to delineate the eastern edge of the boundary of the plume. 12 borings will be advanced in this effort. Two soil samples, one from near the water table and one from the vadose zone, will be collected from each boring and analyzed for diesel range organics (DRO) and residual range organics (RRO) via ADEC methods AK102 and AK103. Four of the borings will be completed as monitoring wells. One groundwater sample will be collected from each of the four wells and analyzed for DRO and RRO via methods AK102 and AK103. Groundwater samples will also be evaluated for Total Aromatic Hydrocarbons (TAH, or BTEX) and Total Aqueous Hydrocarbons (TAqH, or BTEX + Polynuclear Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs)) by analyzing via EPA Method Methods 8021B or 8260B to quantify monoaromatic hydrocarbons and to measure TAH; and EPA method Methods 8270C (including SIMS) or 8310 for the list of 16 Polynuclear Aromatic Hydrocarbons listed by EPA Method 610. All locations of borings and samples will be surveyed for horizontal coordinates only.</span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Deliverables are a pre-draft, draft and final work plan, to include a sampling and analysis plan, site safety and health plan and contractor quality control plan, and pre-draft, draft and final report. In accordance with the Manual for Electronic Deliverables (MED). </span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CANOL Pipeline<br />The CANOL pipeline extends for 605 miles from Whitehorse, Canada, to Fairbanks, Alaska. About 296 miles of the pipeline are in Alaska. The pipeline located in Canada is not eligible for DERP-FUDS funding. Along the 296 miles of pipeline, there are 1,079 tracts of land, owned by approximately 444 landowners. The CANOL project consists of the former pipeline right of way, possible dumps, staging areas and camps associated with construction of the pipeline; and valves, pump stations and maintenance facilities associated with operation of the pipeline. Operation of the CANOL pipeline ended in 1955, and since then much of the pipeline and associated facilities have been removed or demolished by contractors working for the Federal government or private individuals acting on their own. Fuel leaks and spills from operation of the pipeline may pose a risk to local residents. Contaminant sources include pipeline appurtenances associated with fuel storage and distribution, as well as sources associated with ancillary service of the CANOL pipeline (personnel camps and infrastructure, 55-gallon drums, oil cans, miscellaneous debris). Suspected contaminated media includes soil (surface and subsurface), groundwater, surface water, and sediment.</span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The scope will include preparing planning documents, evaluating the nature and extent of contamination, reporting, and the associated project management. Media to be sampled and order of magnitude will vary by site, but will include soil, groundwater, surface water, and/or sediment. General fieldwork, sampling methodology, frequency, and standards shall conform to ADEC guidance documents, 18 AAC 75, 18 AAC 78, and ADEC UST procedures manual. Direct push and hollow-stem drilling methods typically achieve necessary soil sampling and groundwater well requirements, although air-rotary capabilities may be necessary in extreme cases. Typical contaminants of concern (COCs) include gasoline ranges organics (GRO), DRO, RRO, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs), and RCRA metals. Additional analytes may include ethylene dibromide (EDB), dichloroethane (DCA), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB). Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Program (ELAP) certification will be required for all appropriate analytical methods. Appropriate detection limits, limits of detection, and limits of quantitation to evaluate ADEC promulgated cleanup levels will be required. Analyses of historical documents, georeferencing of as-built drawings and historical photos necessary to locate sites and site features may be required. Coordination with SHPO for permitting may be required. GPS capabilities that adhere to the requirements of the MED are necessary. Geophysics may be required to locate subsurface site features and/or utilities.</span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">All deliverables are required to conform to the standards and specifications outlined in the MED, as well as ADEC Site Characterization Work Plan and Reporting Guidance. Deliverables will include draft and final work plans, updated ecological and human health conceptual site models and draft and final Site Investigation reports. Organizing and leading public meetings to inform local communities about proposed field efforts and incorporate public concerns into planning/reporting documents and the field efforts themselves is required. Meeting requirements typically include adequate advertising of the meeting to the local community, capacity to accommodate up to 20 meeting attendees, handicapped/disabled accessibility, teleconferencing capability, and multimedia presentation capability.</span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fort Morrow<br />Additional RI work is required at the former Fort Morrow Army Post, located at Port Heiden, Alaska. Under the Formerly Used Defense Sites Program, the former Fort Morrow is eligible for environmental restoration funding. A remedial investigation is required under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act prior to performing extensive remediation activities. A contractor conducted remedial activities between 2011 and 2015, and submitted a Final Phase II Remedial Investigation Report in November 2016. Additional investigation will be required to fully characterize the site.<br />Closure of the Fort in 1945 resulted in the documented abandonment of thousands of drums of aviation fuel, petroleum, oil, lubricants, and other maintenance fluids. As a result of RI activities performed to date, the former Fort Morrow was divided into 13 Areas of Concern (AOCs), A through M, based on military activities that occurred within each area. A total of 195 features were screened for petroleum, oil, and lubricant (POL) contamination between AOC B (21 features), AOC M (171 features), AOC E (one feature), and AOC F (two features).</span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data gaps remain and additional soil and groundwater samples will be required to fill these gaps. Additional RI work will include surface and subsurface soil sampling (up to 100 samples) and the installation and sampling of additional monitoring wells (up to six). It is possible that additional geophysical surveys may need to be conducted (three areas) with subsequent test pits dug (up to two per survey area). Anticipated deliverables include a draft and final UFP-QAPP, Health and Safety Plan, project Fact Sheets, and draft and final reports in compliance with the MED. The contractor will host a public meeting in Port Heiden to present the status of the RI. The contractor will compare existing data from previous RI work against applicable cleanup levels.</span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Eklutna Army Site<br />The Eklutna Army Site is located 26 miles northeast of Anchorage, Alaska. The site was used by the United States Army as a suspected supply and storage area from 1957 to 1971. Widespread chlorinated solvent contamination has been identified in the site soils and groundwater. Hydrogeology at the site is extremely complex due to the Eklutna River, Chugach Mountains, and Cook Inlet. The Phase III RI will include the installation of additional groundwater monitoring wells, a tidal influence study, groundwater modelling, additional soil gas and sediment sampling, and a complete human health and ecological risk assessment that evaluates all likely future land use scenarios.</span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The field portion of the Phase III RI will include the installation and sampling of 25 monitoring wells. Some wells will extend to more than 150 feet bgs. The Contractor will also collect approximately 10 sediment samples and 25 soil gas samples that will be used to support the risk assessment. The tidal study will be complex and likely include evaluating tidal influences on 10 monitoring wells.

(t) System for Award Management (SAM). (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <BR> <BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of Payment? paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <BR> <BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ``I agree'' click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ``click-wrap'' or ``browse-wrap'' agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u) (1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. (v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor's representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract. <BR> <BR>(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: (1) 52.209-10, Prohibition on Contracting with Inverted Domestic Corporations (Nov 2015).

<DESC>NOTE: THE&nbsp;RFP IS REVISED FROM A&nbsp;FIXED&nbsp;UNIT PRICE SOLICITATION TO A FIRM FIXED PRICE SOLICITATION&nbsp; It has been designated RFP 10888-R-71465.<br /><br />1. Description of the Work <br />1.1 The MOX Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF) is being designed and constructed to produce completed Mixed Oxide (MOX) fuel assemblies for use in domestic, commercial nuclear power reactors. Feed material is uranium dioxide and surplus plutonium dioxide.<br />1.2 The MFFF is located in F-Area of the Savannah River Site (SRS) in South Carolina. Access to the site is via South Carolina Route (SCR) 19, SRS Road 2, SRS Road C and SRS F-Loop Road.<br />1.3 The manufacturing area is the MOX Fuel Fabrication Building (BMF). It is a multi-story hardened reinforced concrete structure enclosing approximately 441,000 sq ft. The BMF building is comprised of three main areas: the (MOX) Mixed Oxide Processing Area (BMP), the Aqueous Polishing Area (BAP), and the Shipping and Receiving Area (BSR). There are over 600 rooms in the BMF. The CP23-9 HVAC Installation Subcontract includes the installation of ductwork, supports, and in-line devices in ductwork systems in rooms within the BMF. The BMF contains approximately 1,300,000 pounds of duct ranging in size from 3" round duct to rectangular duct larger than 144" on a side. Approximately 400,000 pounds has been installed.<br />1.4 The CP23-9 HVAC Installation Subcontract will be a firm price installation for the scope described in the Subcontract to include the applicable portions of the Specifications, drawings and procedures in Section H Implementing Documents. Pricing shall take into account all work defined within the scope of work, procedural requirements set forth in MOX Services Project Procedures included in Section H, and requirements specified within the Engineering Specifications and drawings provided in Section H. The Subcontractor is responsible for the takeoff and the value of the scope of work scheduled. Portions of the scope of work to be executed during the base Period of Performance (POP) will have been completed by others. The percent complete for these rooms has been identified in the Section G Attachment 4.
