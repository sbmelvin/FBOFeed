<DESC>ENGINEERED BIO-MOLECULAR NANO-DEVICES/SYSTEMS.                            SOL: BAA05 –16. DUE: March 4, 2005. POC:Dr. Anantha Krishnan, DARPA/DSO. FAX: (703) 696-4470. WEB: http://www.darpa.mil/baa/. E-MAIL:BAA05-16@darpa.mil. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION. The Defense Sciences Office is soliciting proposals for innovative research on the development and demonstration of a chip scale array platform that integrates scalable biological ion channel device architectures to enable direct, real-time conversion of bio-molecular signals into electrical signals. A critical focus of this program is the exploitation of stochastic, temporal information for the real-time analysis and detection of various molecular targets of interest.  The program is expected to incorporate several recent advances in ion channel devices that have demonstrated robust and reproducible signals from scalable architectures. The program will demonstrate the integration of 50 or more individually addressable and functional ion channel sensing elements on a chip with a 1 sq. cm footprint, with integrated microfluidics, sensing electrodes and electronic devices for signal processing. Real time readout of signals will be obtained for analytes and mixtures of analytes in the presence of common environmental interferants such as smoke, dust, fuel vapors and exhaust fumes.  The program will demonstrate functional and stable operation of the chip over an extended time duration ranging from weeks to months.  The program will quantify the number, type and distribution of ion channel sensing elements necessary to achieve ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristics) parameters such as Probability of Detection            (> 99%), Probability of False Alarms (<1/1000) and Dynamic Range in Concentration    (> 106). The demonstration studies will also evaluate the ability of the platform to distinguish signal from clutter and the ability to quickly classify an unknown analyte with appropriate confidence limits. PROGRAM SCOPE AND FUNDING. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is requesting only full proposals for this program.  This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) constitutes the entire solicitation for this effort.  No Proposer Information Pamphlet or other additional information will be published, nor will a formal request for proposal, or other solicitation, regarding this research and development be issued.  Requests for same will be disregarded. The amount of resources made available to this BAA will depend on the quality of the proposals received and the availability of funds.  While there is no specific requirement for cost and duration of the proposed effort, it is recommended that proposers include a program plan of no more than 24 months in duration that addresses the most critical issues on the path to success. Tasks beyond this duration and scope may be proposed as options. OTHER RELEVANT INFORMATION FOR PROPOSAL SUBMISSION. Teaming and Team Composition. The potential for successful outcome in this program will depend on the formation of well-managed interdisciplinary teams that are focused on component integration and demonstration of an array platform.  It is anticipated that the successful team will have expertise in areas such as molecular biology, bio-chemistry, electrical engineering, circuit design, microelectronics, signal processing, microfluidics, and micro/nano-fabrication. In addition, it is expected that a strong modeling component will be included wherever necessary.  Regardless of the interdisciplinary composition of the team, its members will need to be sharply and collectively focused on achieving the program objectives under the leadership of a platform integrator. Technology Transition. Proposers are strongly encouraged to engage commercial and military end-users and commercial manufacturers from the program inception.  The engagement of these communities also helps ensure that the various technologies being developed will be commercially viable (cost effective, manufacturability, etc.) and available to the military.  Thus, proposals are strongly encouraged to include/involve the user-community that intends to bring the technology to practice as a result of this research.  This relationship encourages the participation of researchers, end-users and manufacturers as collective contributors to the technology definition, implementation, and performance evaluation. Proprietary Information. All proprietary information should be clearly marked.  It is the policy of DARPA to treat all proposals as competitive information and to disclose their contents only for the purpose of evaluation.  Standard proprietary disclaimers notwithstanding, proposals may be reviewed by non-Government technical experts who have signed a non-disclosure agreement with DARPA, unless the specific phrase “TO BE REVIEWED BY GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES ONLY” appears on the cover sheet.  In any case, personnel under exclusive contract with DARPA who have completed the appropriate nondisclosure agreements will handle the proposals for administrative purposes. The proposal should describe clearly the individual and joint intellectual property rights/ownership to the technologies developed in the program, and agreements to that effect among the members of the team. Security. Proposals may contain classified information or data (up to the level of Top Secret/SCI). Offerors that intend to include classified information or data in their proposals above Department of Defense (DoD) SECRET should contact DARPA security at the address identified in this BAA (or alternatively, the point-of-contact for this BAA) for guidance and direction in advance of proposal preparation.  DO NOT SEND CLASSIFIED FULL PROPOSALS BY EMAIL OR VIA ONLINE SUBMISSION SYSTEMS.  Offerors must have existing approved capabilities (personnel and facilities) to perform research and development at the classification level they propose. PROPOSAL SUBMISSION AND DEADLINES. Proposals may be submitted and received at any time until the final proposal deadline of 4 PM ET March 4, 2005.  Proposals will be evaluated against the criteria set forth in this solicitation, and an offeror will be notified either that: 1) the proposal has been selected for funding, or 2) the proposal has not been selected for funding.  Proposers may elect to have their proposal withdrawn from consideration at any time during the evaluation process.  If a formal request is not made, DARPA will assume that continued evaluation is desired.  One copy only of proposals that are not selected for funding will be retained for administrative purposes. The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.  The Government also reserves the right to fund proposals in phases with options for continued work at the end of one or more of the phases.  Proposals identified for funding may result in a procurement contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or "Other Transaction," depending upon the nature of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between parties, and other factors. The offeror must submit a separate list of all technical data or computer software that will be furnished to the Government with other than unlimited rights (see DFARS Part 227). FORMAT AND CONTENT OF FULL PROPOSAL. The descriptions contained in this section are to help proposers ensure that proposals have sufficiently detailed information to be evaluated.

<DESC>The DOE Savannah River Operations Office awarded two Purchase Orders to JXLC Consulting (poc: James Lieberman) and JTG Consulting (poc: John Greeves) to assist the DOE Savannah River Operations Office with technical and programmatic support relative to its plans to make non-high-level waste determinations for radioactive wastes resulting from spent fuel reprocessing, that DOE-SR plans to manage and dispose onsite as low-level waste at SRS.  These services are required by DOE-SR and DOE-EM as waste determinations are made to implement the SRS EM accelerated cleanup. The Secretary of Energy is required to consult on waste determinations with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).  The first DOE deliverable is due to the NRC by the end of January 2005, and the advice/technical services defined in this procurement is required prior to that time.  The waste determination preparation and approval work is critical path to completion of the EM accelerated cleanup at the Savannah River Site and each day of delay will result in additional lifecycle cost to the Government of $1 million. Therefore, it is essential to complete the work for waste determinations immediately/urgently and thus precludes full and open competition.  Delay in award of this procurement would result in serious financial injury to ther Government. The DOE-SR Contracting Officer has determined that based urgency of the requirment as well as the vendors' nuclear/regulatory experience, they are the only sources reasonably available to fulfill this urgent requirement, and that justification for other than full and open competition at FAR 6.302.2 applies.

<DESC>The DOE Savannah River Operations Office awarded Purchase Order to JTG Consulting (poc: John Greeves) to assist the DOE Savannah River Operations Office with technical and programmatic support relative to its plans to make non-high-level waste determinations for radioactive wastes resulting from spent fuel reprocessing, that DOE-SR plans to manage and dispose onsite as low-level waste at SRS.  These services are required by DOE-SR and DOE-EM as waste determinations are made to implement the SRS EM accelerated cleanup. The Secretary of Energy is required to consult on waste determinations with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).  The first DOE deliverable is due to the NRC by the end of January 2005, and the advice/technical services defined in this procurement is required prior to that time.  The waste determination preparation and approval work is critical path to completion of the EM accelerated cleanup at the Savannah River Site and each day of delay will result in additional lifecycle cost to the Government of $1 million. Therefore, it is essential to complete the work for waste determinations immediately/urgently and thus precludes full and open competition.  Delay in award of this procurement would result in serious financial injury to ther Government. The DOE-SR Contracting Officer has determined that based urgency of the requirment as well as the vendors' nuclear/regulatory experience, they are the only sources reasonably available to fulfill this urgent requirement, and that justification for other than full and open competition at FAR 6.302.2 applies.

1.  STATEMENT OF WORK NLG AIRWORTHINESS EVAULATION AND REPAIR:  The contractor agrees to comply with the following statement of work to evaluate for airworthiness, and overhaul two Nose Landing Gear Struts, Part Number A23659023-1C, Serial Numbers B485 and B490.

	OVERVIEW:  The Coast Guard experienced a NLG Strut, Down Lock Lug failure in August 2003 at Air Station Cape Cod.  All CG owned NLG’s were inspected IAW TCTO HU25-T32090 (ENCL 1).  NLG B485 & B490 failed to meet Eddy Current (Conductivity) inspection criteria.  Both struts indicated low conductivity readings in the area of both LH and RH inboard sides of each lug (ENCL 1).  B845 and B490 require overhaul, pending the airworthiness status of low conductivity readings.  Determining airworthiness and development of a repair scheme for this flight safety critical component is beyond the capability of the USCG Aircraft Repair and Supply Center.  This SOW is to guide the contractor in developing an OEM approved repair scheme.  This document is intended to address all areas of concern.  However, it is recognized that during the process of repair scheme development circumstances may arise which could not be anticipated.  For such instances, direct communication with the HU-25 Engineering Cell of the Coast Guard Aircraft Repair and Supply Center will be required.  These communications shall be for the purposes of clarification only and shall not be construed by the contractor as authorization for an increase in the scope of work being performed.  In the event discussions result in the need for a change, the contractor shall not perform additional work without the Contracting Officer’s authorization.  LCDR Chip Hatfield, (252) 335-6877 and CWO Dorsey Johr, (252) 335-6310 are the POC’s for relevant questions.

SCOPE OF WORK  The information contained herein is not intended to be all inclusive nor to detract from procedures outlined in the manufacturer’s drawings, specifications and service bulletins except where specifically noted herein.  The contractor shall evaluate each of the landing gear down lock lugs for airworthiness, develop an OEM approved repair scheme to ensure continued safe flight operations of these two assemblies.  Upon finding that the NLG are airworthy the NLG shall be overhauled IAW OEM specifications.  .

This Statement of Work (SOW) establishes the minimum requirements that are required to determine NLG airworthiness status and overhaul.  These tasks entail inspection of suspect areas of the NLG provided by USCG ARSC, Elizabeth City, NC, review of similar repairs developed for civilian Falcon 20/200 fleet and tailoring these repairs for application on the HU25.  Overhaul is to be accomplished in accordance with the manufacturer’s specifications except where specifically noted herein after Down lock Lug inspection and the NLG are deemed airworthy..  Messier-Bugatti of Velizy-Villacoublay, France is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM).  The contractor shall provide their own repair manuals as the Coast Guard does not own nor can it provide this data.  Dassault Falcon Jet Corporation, Teterboro Airport, Teterboro, New Jersey 07652, is Messier’s distributor.

U.S. COAST GUARD
HU25 AILERON REPAIR
STATEMENT OF WORK
12 MARCH 04

1.0	BACKGROUND 
The U.S. Coast Guard currently operates twenty (20) HU-25 aircraft manufactured between 1982 and 1984 by Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA-Avions Marcel.  These aircraft are used differently from general aviation as HU-25 missions frequently operate within salt-laden environments.  This condition accelerates the corrosive attack to the HU-25’s Ailerons (P/Ns MY20151-4 LH and MY20152-4 RH).
2.0	OBJECTIVE
2.1.	The Coast Guard’s objective is to obtain services of a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) authorized 
repair center to effectively repair and provide complete, ready-to-install HU-25 aileron assemblies.  Repaired ailerons must meet the OEM’s critical profile and contour dimensions to ensure the fit to aircraft with minimal adjustment during installation.  In addition, corrosion preventative steps shall be incorporated during repair.
2.2.	The Coast Guard anticipates two levels of repair for these control surfaces.  First, a “baseline repair” would be required for ailerons that are subject to limited damage, such as exterior corrosion or impact damage and replacement of hardware and/or skin.  The Second level, “extensive repair” would include baseline repairs and the replacement of major extrusions, i.e., fittings.  The quoter shall provide a cost break down for items above and beyond a baseline repair.  At a minimum, these two levels of service should be addressed in the quote.  Quoters may submit additional levels of service.
3.0	To meet the Coast Guard’s objectives the quoter will be required to meet the following technical criteria: 
3.1.	The quoter is responsible for all necessary functions to perform services requested.  This includes, but is not limited, required tooling, test equipment, parts, material, engineering services, management, maintenance,  preservation, storage, shipping, etc., to repair/overhaul these control surfaces
3.2.	Either possess or show ability to obtain adequate technical data, tooling and fixtures to meet the OEM’s critical profile and contour dimensions.
3.3.	Past Performance.
3.3.1.	Provide documentation for having performed repair/overhaul of similar or like items.
3.3.2.	Provide Points of Contact for past performance documentation for the past two years. Include references’ name, company, phone number, and e-mail address
3.3.3.	Provide evidence of and ability to maintain a Quality System acceptable to the Coast Guard.
3.0	APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS 
The following Technical Specifications are applicable:
a.	OEM drawings
b.	CG Technical Orders:
1.	CGTO 1U-25A-3 (Structural Repair Manual)
2.	CGTO 1U-25A-4, Chapters 57 (Illustrated Parts Catalog)
e.	Data Availability:
	1.	OEM drawings are proprietary and cannot be provided by the Coast Guard.
	2.	Coast Guard specific CGTOs can be acquired through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).Submit a written request to:

In addition, corrosion preventative steps shall be incorporated during repair.
2.2.5.2.	   The Coast Guard anticipates two levels of repair for these control surfaces.  First, a “return to service repair” would be required for control surfaces that are subject to limited damage, such as exterior corrosion or impact damage and replacement of hardware and/or skin.  Second, “extensive repair” would be required for control surfaces that also include return to service repairs and require the replacement of major extrusions, i.e., fittings.  The quoter shall provide a cost break down for items above and beyond a return to service repair.  At a minimum, these two levels of service should be addressed in the quote.  Quoters may submit additional levels of service.

<DESC>Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to negotiate and award a contract modification for providing support for the integration of Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) capability into the Tomahawk Weapon System (TWS). NAVAIR intends to award this effort to Raytheon Systems Company (RSC), P.O. Box 11337, Tucson, Arizona 85734-1337.  Raytheon is the only company capable of performing this effort.  Since 1994, RSC has been the sole developer, designer and manufacturer for the Tomahawk All-Up-Round (AUR).  RSC solely possesses the current configuration and manufacturing data for the Tomahawk Block IV missile.  RSC currently manages the key requirements, interface, integration, and verification documents for the Tomahawk Weapons System.  Because a detailed knowledge and expertise of the Tactical Tomahawk missile is required to provide support to the SAASM-TWS implementation effort, RSC is the only source capable of accomplishing this requirement in the required timeframe and without duplication of costs.

Options will be included for engineering/detail design for the LHA(R) Flight 0 ship and for special studies to develop/refine the requirements for all ships of the LHA(R) Program.  The special studies will focus on total ship designs integration, hull systems engineering, essential mission systems, total ship survivability, C4ISR and Warfare systems, total ownership cost reductions, producibility and production assessments, environmen! tal compliance, and human systems integration.  The basic contract will include effort for Fiscal Year (FY) 2005 with options for additional effort in FY 2006.  Annual options for special studies for FY 2005 through FY 2009 will be included.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for continued maintenance support for ABAQUS software for one base year and two option years. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from ABAQUS East, LLC as the only known responsible source that can meet Agency requirements.  ABAQUS software is one of the main tools used to perform the required analysis and verification of the dynamic response of aerospace vehicles.  The renewal of the annual maintenance agreement is required to continue receiving regular updates as new versions of the software are released; access to technical support; prompt notification of bugs; and new documentation as it is published.  It would take substantial duplication of time and money for another company to offer a similar product that would meet this requirement, and these costs are not expected to be recovered through competition. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on JANUARY 25, 2005.

<CONTACT>MATTHEW J. GROWNEY, Contract Specialist, Phone: 513-487-2029, E-Mail: growney.matthew@epa.gov
<DESC>This synopsis is being provided to publish a requirement for the National Vehicle and Fuels Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL) of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in Ann Arbor, Michigan which is seeking the delivery of one on-vehicle real-time exhaust Particulate Mass PM emissions measurement system and/or Portable PM Device (PPMD). EPA's requires a commercially supported product that has a fast and accurate data acquisition system for local data logging, remote control, and real-time data viewing via cabled CAN Bus, RS232, and/or radio frequency networks with the option of using a remote cellular connection.   This product must have a user-friendly graphical interface and open software architecture.  At a minimum, the product must quantify and record real-time PM mass emissions (mass concentration), exhaust flow rate; exhaust temperatures, pressures, and relative humidity; optional GPS capability via CAN Buss and the ability to simultaneously measure emission concentrations from two different locations of the exhaust (i.e. upstream and downstream of exhaust after-treatment systems).  In addition, the product must provide for collection of exhaust PM filter samples.  This system must be applicable to diesel and gasoline engine applications. The following major features are required for the PPMD: (1)  Simultaneous Pre-test, Sampling and Post-test conditioning to adjust collection media for immediate use to facilitate rapid change during tests. (2) Real-time sample humidity compensation. (3)  Minimal operator intervention. (4) Mechanical Design Suitable for on-vehicle applications. (5) A heated (200  C) "In-tail Pipe" Proportional Sampling probe for real-time and integral PM measurements; (a)  The Exhaust Flow Measurement and Proportional Dilution of Sample are fully embedded in the instrument.  The proportional sampling system incorporates a high-speed dilution system that regulates the sample flow rate proportionally according to the real-time exhaust flow and (b)  Include gravimetric sampling using 35 mm filters with media and sampling protocol to be specified in CFR 40, Part 1065 in addition to the continuous PM monitoring system. (6) Software requirements include (a) The instrument must have on-board data acquisition capabilities for measured parameters and data storage capacity to accommodate at least 10 hrs of stored data at 1 Hz and (b) Simple PC/CAN Bus interface. (7) Packaging shall meet the following requirements: (a) Suitable for on-vehicle and stationary use; (b) Low power 12 VDC powered (<200 W); (c) As part of the PPMD system, EPA requires compatibility with a commercially supported PC product for instrument set-up, calibration, data acquisition/recovery, and control that is tailored to on-vehicle emissions measurement; (d) EPA requires a product with fast-response sensors for real-time measurements.  This unit should be insensitive to exhaust flow fluctuation or be able to compensate for them; and  (e) EPA requires an accurate product with minimal maintenance requirements.  The proposed unit must be insensitive to interferences from other exhaust products or be able to compensate for them.  Since these instruments will be operated on-vehicle they must be capable of operating in the same environmental conditions as the vehicle.  The PPMD's connection to the host vehicle's exhaust and electronic system must be completely passive, requiring no modification to the vehicle. The North American Industry Classification Code is 488999 with a small business size standard of $6 million.  A written Request for Quotation (RFQ), PR-CI-05-10332, is anticipated to be issued on Monday 2/1/05.  Interested parties should submit a written request to receive the RFQ to Mr. Matthew Growney at growney.matthew@epa.gov .  All responsible businesses may submit a quotation in response to the solicitation which shall be considered by the Agency.  This procurement will be pursued in accordance with FAR Part 12 using FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition methods and procedures.  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. An offer must include the minimum requirements of the Statement of Work (SOW).  Contract type will be firm fixed price.

<DESC>The Specialty Center Contracts Core, NFECSW Code AQN00 intends to make a sole source award to Baker Engineering and Risk Consultants, Inc., San Antonio TX 78218. Baker Engineering and Risk Consultants, Inc. shall provide subject matter experts in physics associated with shock loads and impulse; numerical methods used to predict the effects of these loads on structures; and field and laboratory testing specifically on explosives safety concerns.  This includes support in the terrorism related issues; reactive or explosive materials, risk analysis, and process facilities.  In addition, the contractor shall be required to provide the knowledge source materials used by Dr. Wilfred E. Baker in developing the TM 5-1300 equations and figures.  When the Tri-service manual TM 5-1300, “Structures to Resist the Effects of Accidental Explosions” was being updated during the 1980’s the government used Dr. Wilfred E. Baker, a national explosion effects expert, as one of the primary consultants.  When the document was published in 1990, the government manual style did not include footnotes to document the sources for equations and figures.  With the passing of time, and with Dr. Wilfred E. Baker passing away, knowledge of the source material has been lost.  Quentin Baker, the son of Dr. Wilfred E. Baker, is now the president of Baker Engineering and Risk Consultants.  He is the only person having access to Dr. Baker’s library collection of notes, articles, test results, and other materials associated with the origin of TM 5-1300 equations and figures.  He has studied under his father and has reviewed his documents.  He is the only person who has the historical understanding of his father’s work.  The authority for this sole source procurement is cited in FAR 6.302-1, in that Baker Engineering and Risk Consultants, Inc. is the only known source with the knowledge required to provide these services.  Vendor/s who wish to challenge this sole-source procurement must give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the publication date of this synopsis.  The contract type will be a Firm Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (FFP/IDIQ) and the period of performance is 3 years: one base year plus 2 option years.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:     The Military Applications in Surveillance and Reconnaissance (MARS) program that supports the Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Unmanned Ground Reconnaissance (CUGR) Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACT D) program is seeking to identify candidate technologies that with short-term development can provide sample collection devices for air, aerosols, vapor, liquids, and solids.  Similarly, sensors that can trigger, detect, or identify CBRN agents, Toxic Indu strial Chemicals or Materials (TICS/TIMS), O2, LEL/UEL, VOC, CO, and H2S detection are also sought.   New and novel systems that can provide an integration platform for multi-variate sensors will also be entertained.  These sensors need to be small, rugged , and use minimal power in order to facilitate integration on a small Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) and must be interface-able with systems that can relay status and control to/from an external controller by means such as serial, infrared (IRDA) or Etherne t.  Use of multiple sensors to provide this capability is acceptable.     Technologies must be maturable to a TRL-6 level within 2 years.  Ideally, these technologies should be available to support system integration and technical testing in mid FY07, foll owed by operational demonstration in late FY07.     This call for product information is open to DoD contractors, commercial entities, and US government agencies.     Companies and organizations that would like their detection/identification/collection pro ducts considered for use in the MARS Demonstration Program will be provided with detailed instructions for submitting product specifications, submission templates , and detailed MARS needs.     Requests for this information should be made by e-mail to stev en.skolnik@apgea.army.mil or by calling 410-436-3955 .     This request must provide the requestor's name, company or organization, address, telephone number, and e-mail address. Material solutions and concepts may be submitted anytime before xxxx. Partici pation in MARS Demonstration Project solicitation is totally voluntary, and the government does not intend to award any contracts or pay any costs associated with this solicitation.

<CONTACT>David Dilks, 312-846-5373
<DESC>By way of this notice, and in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, the Chicago District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announces its intention to award a sole source contract to Environmental Quality Management, Inc. (EQM) for gap closure of approximately 32, 000 square feet of soil bentonite slurry trench cutoff wall.   The slurry trench cutoff wall is a low permeability wall excavated or placed through the existing ground or prepared working surface down to the required key-in distance into the key stratum. The slurry method of excavation consists of excavating a vertica l walled trench and at the same time keeping the trench filled with a bentonite slurry mixture.   The work consists of subsurface survey investigations to locate, identify, inspect, and removal all obstructions on the surface, subsurface obstructions or buried structures that would prevent installation of the cutoff wall.  The investigation includes in spection trenching and dewatering along the cutoff wall alignment to a depth of 15 feet.  The obstruction removal work includes plugging, capping, and closure all open pipes and conduits upon removal of the obstructions. Given that EQM performed the subsurface investigation and cutoff wall construction for the existing soil bentonite slurry trench cutoff wall and that the cross-section and mix design for the soil-bentonite slurry trench cutoff wall gaps is the responsibili ty of the Contractor, and it must be compatible with the elevations, lines, grades, and cross-sections of the existing slurry trench cutoff wall, it is to the benefit of the Corps that one Contractor be held responsible for constructing the entire slurry t rench cutoff wall and ensure that it meets all performance criteria.  Since all work is subsurface, visual inspection of the work is impossible.  Completion of the slurry wall by EQM, the original source, will enhance assurance that the entire slurry trenc h cutoff will function as intended when installed.  Assurance of function is essential since the project site has open Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) status.  In addition, the site requires RCRA corrective action, due to the contamination of  soil and groundwater on site from past industrial activities. The completed slurry wall must provide a continuous, homogeneous, relatively impermeable barrier to groundwater seepage. Therefore, we consider this acquisition to be available from one source, Environmental Quality Management, Inc. (EQM). The contract performance period is for approximately 365 calendar days.  It is anticipated that the resultant contract will be a firm-fixed-priced construction contract. This notice is NOT a Request for Proposals, therefore, NO solicitation documents will be issued. Award is anticipated on or about 9 Mar 05. The Point of Contact for this contractual action is David Dilks, Contract Specialist at Telephone (312) 846-5371 or Email to: david.m.dilks@usace.army.mil.

DESCRIPTION: Architect/Engineer (A/E) services are required for a regional firm fixed-price Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract for design and preparation of construction plans and specifications for activities serviced by Engineering Field Activity Northwest. These areas include, but are not limited to, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Alaska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, Wyoming, Colorado, and Nevada. Work will primarily be performed in Washington, however work may occur in other areas when necessary. Required A/E services are primarily civil/structural in nature, but a strong multi-discipline team is required. Services shall be accomplished in the firm’s office with the exception of field/subsurface investigations and surveys as required at the project site. 

The maximum contract value may not exceed $10M aggregate total. The minimum guarantee for the contract shall be $10K. The value of individual task orders executed under this contract may range from $1K to $1M. The Government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or the actual amount of work to be ordered. Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee. Multiple task orders may be awarded with similar completion schedules and overlapping delivery dates. Contract term is for a one-year base period with two option periods. Each performance period will run 365 calendar days, or until the maximum dollar limit is reached, whichever occurs first. The government may exercise the option periods unilaterally. Per NFAS 17.208-100(c)(1), options for post construction award services may be negotiated on individual task orders for unilateral exercise. Estimated start date for this contract is May 2005. Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 36.6 (Brooks Act) selection procedures apply. This is an unrestricted procurement. The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541330 and the annual small business size standard is $4M. 

Task orders are primarily for the preparation of packages (including plans, specifications, and cost estimates) for the bidding of contracts for design/build or fully designed renovation, or new construction contracts. Anticipated projects include a wide range of facilities, structures, and utility infrastructure, which may in some cases be located near an active waterfront. Other representative projects may include: aircraft runways, and related facilities and utilities; structural designs for new and existing facilities including seismic upgrades and foundations in locations susceptible to liquefaction and differential settlement; inspection and evaluation of earthquake damage; ordnance handling and storage facilities; cranes and elevators in buildings; utilities and site development; storage tank systems; storm and sanitary drainage; street and landscape improvements; parking facilities; and fire protection and alarm systems. Work will include preparation of design/build Requests for Proposal (RFPs) and fully designed plans and specifications to accomplish renovation projects or for the construction of new facilities. Services may also include cost estimating, economic analysis, engineering studies, and seismic analysis of existing structures using current DoD seismic criteria, design using Navy Anti-Terrorism Force Protection (ATFP) criteria, topographic surveys, sub-surface investigations, utility studies, construction support, cathodic protection, and identifying environmental concerns. During the performance of this contract, hazardous materials/waste assessments or surveys may be required. Firms must be able to accept work that involves asbestos, lead based paint, PCBs, and other hazardous materials. Cost estimates shall be prepared by a professional cost estimator, using R.S. Means, historical data, or Tri-Services Unit Price Book, and using SUCCESS (NAVFAC Web-based) cost estimating software. Computer drawing data shall be provided on electronic media compatible with Intergraph Microstation or AutoCAD. Specifications shall be prepared using SPECSINTACT software and will also be provided in .pdf format for posting to Government websites during solicitation. Design using Système Internationale (SI) Metric Units may be required. 

Firms that design or prepare specifications for construction contracts or task orders issued under the resulting contract are prohibited from providing the subsequent construction. This limitation also applies to subsidiaries/affiliates of the firm. SELECTION CRITERIA AND SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS: The selection will be based on the criteria listed below and are in descending order of importance: Criteria 1, Professional Qualifications; Criteria 2, Recent Team Experience; Criteria 3, Past Performance; Criteria 4, Quality Control; Criteria 5, Capacity; Criteria 6, Sustainable Design; Criteria 7, Location; Criteria 8, Commitment to Small Business Concerns; and Criteria 9, Volume of Work. 

SF 330s will be evaluated to determine the most highly qualified firm based on criteria responses. Evaluating past performance and experience may include information provided by the firm, customer inquiries, Government databases, and publicly available sources. Failure to provide requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers could result in a firm being considered less qualified.

The Foreign Service Institute (FSI) provides training and professional development to personnel of the Department of State and the Foreign Service community. The Leadership and Management School (LMS) was established to respond to the increasing recognition of the need for sustained development of career leaders and managers in the Department of State and larger foreign affairs community. The mission of the Leadership and Management School is to prepare our nation's foreign affairs professionals for their leadership responsibilities in the service of the American people. LMS has four divisions: Executive Programs, Management Development, Crisis Management Training, and The Senior Seminar. Through these divisions, LMS achieves its goals by:

·Designing and conducting relevant, cutting-edge leadership and management training programs which address career needs from entry level through the senior ranks;

·Working with individuals, teams, bureaus, and overseas missions to improve organizational effectiveness and crisis management.

The Foreign Service Institute is actively seeking a pool of individual contractors under a multiple award Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) for a variety of regular work schedules or occasional, intermittent activities. Successful contractors may join an existing training or program management staff composed of government employees and other contractors. The work may be conducted in large or small group classrooms, at FSI or other locations, both local and at overseas posts.  (CURRENT BPA CONTRACTORS NEED NOT RESPOND).

All questions must submitted in writing.

<SUBJECT>28--CLEAN FUEL TECHNOLOGY (CFT) PROPULSION SYSTEMS FOR FERRY BOATS
<SOLNBR>N0016705SS001
<RESPDATE>021805
<CONTACT>Contracting Officer - Doug Smith 301-227-1640, Technical POC Rodney Keith, 757-462-3280
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division, Detachment Norfolk (NSWCCDDN) is seeking information from potential sources for clean-fuel technology (CFT) prime movers suitable for use in propulsion systems for four new ferry boats to be procured for the USS ARIZONA Memorial in Pearl Harbor, HI.  Information provided will be used in a trade study to assess the emissions and noise reduction benefits and the technical, cost, schedule and logistical feasibility and maturity of various CFT prime movers for this application.  The trade study will recommend a CFT prime mover option and appropriate acquisition strategy for procurement of ferry boats in FY05-07 timeframe. Examples of candidate CFTs include but are not limited to the following:  EPA Tier II compliant diesel engines; EPA Tier II compliant Compressed Natural Gas (CNG)-fueled Compression Ignition (CI) engines; Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV)-Parallel (Battery for maneuvering at dock, CI engine for transit); HEV-Series (Battery-CI engine); Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV)-shore power (charging overnight or during daytime rotation); Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (EV) or HEV; BEV-solar power (continuous charging during daylight). Existing ferry boat operational capabilities and physical characteristics are provided below for information only.  The requirements for capabilities and characteristics of the new ferry boats will be determined as part of an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA).  Any of a range of potential solutions could be recommended by the AoA.   Existing Craft Characteristics: Length:  70 feet Beam:  21 feet Draft:  3 feet Freeboard:  3 feet minimum, 3.5 feet maximum at loading gates Displacement (Full Load):  85,000 lbs. Hoisting weight:  78,080 lbs. Number of Crew:  Two – one Coxswain, one linehandler/deckhand Number of Passengers:  150, with space for four wheelchairs, covered passenger area with open sides for viewing and ventilation.  Wheelchair-bound passengers can be  embarked from and debarked to the existing piers in all craft load conditions. Speed: 12.3 knots (top speed in full load condition) Note: Cruising speed of at least 10 kt in full load condition is desired for the new ferry boats, and the ability to safely operate and maneuver the craft in all operational weather conditions must be provided. Propulsion:  Two Detroit Diesel GM 6-71N Model 1062-5099 engines (230 bhp at 2100 rpm), each coupled to Twin Disc 509M reverse reduction gears (2.48:1), driving shafts with 35” propellers (26” pitch, three blade). Fuel capacity:  400 gallons Existing Operational Profile/Throughput:  The round trip from the Visitor’s Center to the Memorial and back is approximately one mile. Each boat completes the round trip in 30 minutes (including approx. 5 - 8 minutes on each end for embark/debark).  Two boats (with an additional boat in standby) provide continuous ferry service for eight hours per day without refueling.  Refueling is accomplished nightly.  The ferry service operates 362 days per year, with additional service on certain holidays (Memorial Day, December 7th, etc.).  Existing Infrastructure:  15K gallon diesel fuel storage; maintenance facilities at Ford Island.  Note: The existing pier infrastructure makes it desirable to avoid increasing the length of the new ferry boats, however, beam may be increased.  Draft may be increased, but should be limited consistent with the inherent characteristics of the hullform used.   This Sources Sought Notice requests information describing the offeror’s current product(s), or ability to develop products within the target acquisition timeframe, for the application described herein.   The submitted information should include a complete description and specifications of the CFT prime mover, system and components with supporting technical, cost and support data where available.  Submissions should address the following three system attributes of the CFT propulsion system as integrated into a ferry boat hull: System Performance (Technical Factors):  Safety; capability of the CFT to be integrated into a boat meeting the mission requirements; local and global emissions reduction benefits relative to the existing boat’s propulsion engines and to EPA requirements for new construction; deck and machinery arrangement requirements to incorporate the CFT; ability of the CFT and propulsion system to deliver the required propulsion power throughout the mission of the boat; weights for the CFT prime mover, propulsion system and associated support systems (including e.g. control, charging, cooling, air, exhaust and fuel systems as applicable); contribution of the CFT to solemnity of the USS ARIZONA Memorial, e.g., by reduction of noise and exhaust emissions.  Since some CFT prime movers may be feasible only when used in appropriate hullforms (e.g., low-resistance hullforms), information describing the offeror’s notional or existing ferry boat design should be provided as necessary to demonst! rate the feasibility and benefits of the CFT prime mover for this application. System Attainability (Cost/Schedule/Maturity Factors):  Availability/Maturity of CFT prime mover in the target timeframe for ferry boat acquisition (for schedule projection purposes, target start date for boat construction is Q4 FY05, target delivery date for final boat is Q4 FY07); CFT prime mover cost projections, including projected cost for design, construction, operation, maintenance and associated manuals, drawings and documentation; risks associated with the maturity of the CFT prime mover and integration of the CFT prime mover with the boat, including performance risk and hull, propulsor and subsystem design sensitivity to CFT prime mover design changes.  If an evolutionary approach to implementation of the CFT prime mover is required, provide the benefits and risks, acquisition cost and schedule impacts and life-cycle cost impacts of using a phased-in approach to incorporation of the CFT. System Sustainability (Logistics Factors):  Impact of the CFT on operational and maintenance manning requirements; reliability assessment of the CFT prime mover and associated support systems addressing type and probability of failure modes and projected mean time between failures; CFT system integration into the existing refueling and/or electrical power supply and maintenance infrastructure, including projected cost and complexity of associated infrastructure modifications; operational, maintenance and repair cost risks relating to maturity of the CFT prime mover.  Input is requested from the following: CFT Vendors:  Vendors of CFT prime movers, CFT prime mover based propulsion systems or components, suitable for the application described herein. Vendors With CFT Propulsion Integration Experience:  Vendors who have integrated CFT prime movers into a boat with requirements similar to the ferry boat described herein.

<DESC>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA), Office of Workforce Performance and Training is looking for a small business firm that may be interested and have the capabilities for performing multiple assessment activities in TSA’s selection of Federal Flight Deck Officers (FFDO). TSA, in response to the statutory mandate in the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Title XIV, Arming Pilots Against Terrorism Act (49 U.S.C. 44921), or APATA, and Vision 100--Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act, has an ongoing program to select, train, arm and deputize eligible, qualified flight crewmembers to protect the flight decks of commercial passenger and cargo aircraft from acts of criminal violence or air piracy. The FFDO selection process includes a number of components, each of which must be successfully completed to be eligible to attend training. TSA requires firms to provide the following selection assessment services, which need to be addressed in a capabilities statement:  

1.	Resources for conducting one-on-one in-person clinical interviews of applicants  throughout the U.S. 

TSA seeks approximately 35 - 50 psychologists who:

·	must be licensed (clinical or industrial) with at least ten (10) years of experience including: 
o	the familiarity with and use of objective personality assessments;
o	the assessment of individuals in a selection or fitness-for-duty context; and
o	clinical interviewing experience.

·	are willing and able to conduct TSA’s psychological evaluation including a structured in-person interview, review of documents submitted by the applicant, and objective personality test results (note: this process is very structured and TSA requires a high degree of standardization within and across psychologists); 
·	are based  (i.e., office location and client appointments) in major urban areas (as much as possible corresponding to the hub cities for major air carriers);
·	are willing and able to give priority in scheduling appointments to TSA volunteers, including having flexible and potentially extended office hours (Note:  the volume of interviews to be conducted by individual psychologists will depend on applicant volume; however, it is unlikely that the services of any individual psychologist will be required beyond a part-time basis. Also, as the selection process is ongoing, services will be required on a regular part-time basis for the duration of the contract);
·	must be willing and able to attend periodic training sessions and meetings throughout the period of performance; these will likely require travel and last more than one day; and, 
·	are willing and able to use an Internet-based process, information, and document management system that requires appropriate computer resources (including Internet connectivity) as well as the ability to effectively utilize such resources.

In addition to the foregoing, a lead psychologist must be provided who, will also serve as the primary contact with both TSA and the interviewing psychologists regarding the psychological evaluation. This individual must also have experience in test validation and law enforcement selection as well as in-depth familiarity with normal personality assessments based on the Five Factor Model (FFM) and the use of non-normal personality assessments for employment selection. This individual will work with TSA on managing the process, including providing training and feedback to interviewing psychologists.  TSA reserves the right to review and approve proposed psychologists prior and subsequent to contract award. 

2.	Training test development including content-based multiple-choice tests and computerized shooting simulations (delivered on IES Range 3000 XP-4 firearms simulator systems). 

·	TSA seeks expertise in the development of content valid, computerized, multi-branching video shooting scenarios for use in training and selection (note: this requirement includes only scenario development, not production, delivery or administration).

3.	Technical support such as the conduct of data analyses, criterion development, development of recommendations for selection process improvements (e.g., to increase reliability or validity). 

·	TSA seeks expertise in the development and validation of multiple-choice cognitive, content based tests;
·	TSA seeks expertise in univariate and multivariate data analyses such as might be required for evaluating volunteer flow, pass rates and patterns for various process components.

4.	Administrative support such as managing travel associated with the provision of services (e.g., periodic travel required by interviewing psychologists to attend training).

5.	Maintaining call centers for various process activities (e.g., scheduling volunteers for designated interview sessions).

The first requirement is required on a regular basis throughout the contract period. The remaining requirements are needed on a periodic rather than an ongoing basis. 

Firms must be able to demonstrate their ability to provide the above services and ensure compliance with relevant technical, professional, and legal guidelines, including but not limited to the Principles for the Validation and Use of Personnel Selection Procedures, Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures (1978), and the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing. 

Firms that have been certified as a small business, and have the interest and capabilities to perform multiple assessment activities in TSA’s selection of FFDOs under such requirements, should submit the following information:  (a) Company name and address; (b) Company’s POC, including telephone and facsimile numbers and email address; (c) a capabilities statement no more than 3 pages in length; (d) a statement indicating your intent to submit a bid/offer for this requirement as a prime contractor; (e) evidence of experience in work similar in type and scope to include contract numbers, projects titles, dollar amount, point of contact, and telephone number(s); (f) past performance references with points of contact and phone numbers; and (g) any information supporting the determination that you are a small business under the NAICS code.   

The Government will not reimburse any firms that respond to this notice.  The data provided is not to be considered proprietary.

<DESC>This sources sought synopsis is for a unique counterfeit deterrent feature that can be incorporated into currency paper or applied onto currency paper. The feature will be used by the general public as a visual aid to authenticate U.S. currency. Specifically, the BEP is looking for a counterfeit deterrent feature that is 1)based on leading edge technology, and 2) cannot be easily duplicated, simulated or counterfeited, using commercially available equipment or techniques. For example, features that can be simulated to produce a passable pretense or outward appearance of the feature are not acceptable.  Additionally, the technology must provide a unique and distinctive feature for U.S. currency. 

Sources that are interested in responding to this announcement shall provide a technical description of the feature and the material from which it is made to include how the material and feature are manufactured, a description of the technology used or proposed to be used to manufacture the feature, how the feature would be incorporated or applied to currency paper, and a description of variations of the feature that are available, e.g., colors, graphics or visual effects. To the extent possible under this announcement, provide sufficient information on the feature or the manufacturing technology to distinguish the feature or the technology from features currently available in commercial or banknote applications.  Include identification of unique components of the feature and suggestions on the methodologies or techniques to integrate it in currency notes in order to maximize its effectiveness as an authentication feature.  The feature may be based on or related to features or technologies which are available for commercial or banknote formats, provided it is unique in its characteristics and distinguishable as a unique feature or device.

Sources shall also provide projections on the production readiness of the feature including manufacturing capacity and estimated delivery timeframes for production quantities. Sources shall specifically address their ability to begin delivery of production quantities of this feature to the BEP between March 2006 and June 2006. If any portion of the manufacturing process is to be subcontracted, this shall also be noted.  

Sources shall submit 50 prototype samples in the dimensions proposed for use on currency notes with the response to this synopsis for the Bureau to review and evaluate. These prototype samples shall not be returned.  The Bureau may award a production contract as a result of this announcement, if this announcement results in a feature that is selected for potential incorporation into U.S. currency. Interested sources shall submit their response to this announcement in triplicate to Jennifer L. Sellers, Contracting Officer, Bureau of Engraving, Office of Procurement, Room 708A, 14th and C Streets SW, Washington, DC 20228.

<DESC>SSC Charleston is intending to award a sole source, firm fixed price type contract, to INTELSAT MTC LLC, Bethesda, MD, utilizing commercial acquisition procedures under FAR Part 12.  This contract is to provide the continued use of satellite communication services between CONUS and the South Pole MARISAT GOES Terminal (SPMGT) at the Scott-Amundsen Station, South Pole, Antarctica, commencing in FY 05.  To meet these requirements, the contractor shall provide satellite Space Segment services consisting of a satellite in a geosynchronous and inclined orbit (>11.5 degrees) with sufficient transponder resources required.  The satellite must also be visible to an Earth Station in the continental United States.  INTELSAT's MARISAT-F2 satellite meets the particular requirements necessary for communications with the South Pole.  The MARISAT satellite is in an inclined and geosynchronous orbit, which supports approximately six hours per day of connectivity with the South Pole. The data rates are dependent upon the technical parameters of both earth stations and inter-system interference constraints, but are estimated to be at least 1.544 Mbps in both directions and potentially as high as 2.4 Mbps toward the South Pole and  5 Mbps from the South Pole.  INTELSAT, as the owner/operator of the MARISAT F-2 satellite, is the only known source that can provide the necessary satellite Space Segment and Teleport services to meet mission requirements.  A solicitation will not be made available as a result of this announcement.  Parties interested in subcontracting opportunities are directed to contact INTELSAT.  Questions may be directed to Ms. Joanne Banks at (843) 218-5953.  SEE NOTE #2

<SUBJECT>59--Data Acquisition and Control System components
<DESC>The U. S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service, intends to make a firm-fixed price, sole source award to VXI Technology, Irvine, CA.  GovWorks/DOI intends to issue a Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items and 6.302-1 only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the U. S. Department of Interior Franchise Fund on behalf of the Redstone Technical Test Center.  The Propulsion Test Branch of Red Stone Technical Test Center (RTTC) has a need to procure additional components for a VXI Data Acquisition and Control System.  The Propulsion Test Branch (PTB) of the RTTC has a need for additional components for the VXI Data Acquisition and Control System.  The PTB currently has the Data Acquisition and Control System in use and the new VXI components will expand the system greatly enhancing the RTTC's ability to acquire turbo-shaft engine data and provide significant increases in performance, functionality and efficiency.  The expansion modules are required for the RTTC to continue its Propulsion Test mission in a timely and competitive manner.  The modules manufactured by VXI Technology are compatible with existing mainframes and designed control and acquisition software.  Non-compatible modules are available on the market and are capable of performing the function required.  However, procuring said modules would significantly increase costs and delay schedules.  Additional costs would be incurred to purchase chassis and other AD hardware that is compatible with said modules.  In addition, all the software controls would need to be redesigned and implemented with compatible drivers.  These costs could easily exceed the total cost of the required modules from VXI Technology.  Through the use of market research including literature review, internal searches, and expert knowledge from Douglas R. Chapman,  Electrical Test Engineer, Environmental Test Division, RTTC, it has been determined that the equipment required by RTTC is available from only one responsible source and no other type of equipment will satisfy agency requirements. Other manufacturers have been considered, but do not meet compatibility requirements.  To procure a system from any company other than VXI Technology would result in a much higher initial cost, mismatched hardware and software and would reduce the efficiency of operations due to inconsistencies encountered by having mixed data acquisition and control systems.

The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Ms. Diane Husereau to provide contract support. 

The program objectives are to raise awareness of the U.S. as a travel destination and to motivate the purchase of travel services to enable visitation.  In the 2003, Congress funded a promotion campaign to increase international travel to the United States. [Public Law 108-7, Section 210.]  The 2004 Omnibus Appropriation bill reduced the initial level of available funding, but not the statutory imperative to develop and implement an international advertising and promotional campaign to encourage travel to the United States.

This requirement is a follow-on to continue contract specialist support in areas such as:  preparation of statement of objectives in support of a contract for the U.S Campaign to promote international tourism to the United States  Services may include preparation of  request for quotations; review of technical and price proposals for completeness, accuracy and relevancy;  negotiations, documenting negotiation issues for contracting officer review and approval, preparation of award documents, providing assistance to the COTR in areas such as, review of invoices, developing logs,  and administration roles as COTR; and perform various other contract specialist functions in support of the tourism contract.  

The period of performance of this requirement is from date of award through 12-months, with one additional 12-month option period.  All work is to be performed on-site at Government facilities in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.  

Offerors who believe they can meet this requirement are required to submit in writing an affirmative response with a demonstrating their expertise and a level of competency in the field.  All written responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information demonstrating their ability to meet the above requirements.   The response must be sufficient to permit agency analysis to establish a bonafide capability to meet the requirements.  Failure to submit such documentation will result in the Government proceeding as stated above.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Affirmative written responses must be received no later than 15-days after publication of this synopsis.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
Channel 48 - Commander’s Access Channel


OBJECTIVE 

The 48th Fighter Wing Public Affairs requires a solution for Channel 48, the 48th Fighter Wing Commander’s Access Channel, currently, a Microsoft PowerPoint slide show broadcasted from one computer into the cable system. The wing would like to replace this delivery software with new software and appropriate computer system that will allow the wing to integrate text, graphics, animation and video in real or near-real time like an information channel you would see at an airport or hotel.  The software solution should have a remote capability so that information could be accessed and changed remotely. 
 
Also, the wing would like to make available or broadcast Channel 48 via the Web through 48FW.com, so a web-based application solution will be necessary.

Finally, we would like to have the capability to push Channel 48 out as a screensaver.

TECHNICAL CONSIDERATION

This section is intended to be used to help you understand the wing’s objectives when taken in conjunction with the other information provided below.
1.  Software.  The solution must be software-based.  
1.1.  It must be developed with an Air Force and USAFE-approved commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) product such as Macromedia Director or Adobe Premiere.
1.2.  It must be completely compatible with Microsoft 2000© and XP© Operating Systems and reside on a standard computer or laptop.
1.3.  The design template (i.e. the layout shown on display terminals) must be customizable by qualified 48th Fighter Wing Multimedia or public affairs personnel.  Said personnel should be able to implement their own graphics into the design layout.  For example, if the wing desires to use the USAFE emblem instead of the wing emblem, graphics personnel should have the ability to make this change to the layout.
1.4.  Solution must be available in both a per-license fee and as a “site license” for large license purchases.
1.4.1.  In addition to server software, the wing will need 4 licenses by which updates can be made at other locations.
1.4.2.  Use of the software for broadcasting the Channel 48 on cable should count as only one license.
1.5.  Software must be able to show video and movies at specific, scheduled times. Multimedia will be running 24-hours a day and user-friendly programming will be needed.  PA needs complete control over scheduling for entire messages or parts of messages displayed. Messages need to be able to be set at specific times and repeat at intervals, depending on programming needs.
Text, photos, graphics and video should be seamlessly viewed without any interruption and be inputted from one platform or console.  
1.6.  Computers showing video extensively without crashing.  Software should be able to handle graphics (GIF, JPG, PNG, BMP, ETC), video (MPEG, AVI, etc), animation (flash, shockwave)
2.  Methodology.  Solution must be based on a client-server relationship.  
2.1.  The server must possess an administration module from which data can be transmitted to remote client computers.
2.1.1.  It should be capable of pushing digital content (audio, video, graphics, text) to the remote clients.
2.1.2.  It must provide a scheduling capability to allow for scheduled content pushes.  For example: A message for an event should be able to be programmed today to air next week, and disappear upon termination of event. 
2.1.3.  It must provide a mechanism for “cluster grouping”.  For example, it must enable an administrator to create subsets of clients such as “All dormitories” or “All AAFES locations” so that information can be targeted for and specific to a certain audience.  It should allow different types of information to be sent to various locations simultaneously based on the targeted audience.
2.2.  The communication must use standard protocols such as Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP).
2.3.  The method of transfer must not use streaming technology such as streaming video or streaming text.  All client machines must download audio/visual content at fixed or scheduled intervals from the server into a local cache.
2.4. Complete set-up of software and appropriate hardware will be accomplished on site for customer. 
3.  Security.  Solution must conform to all network security restrictions.
3.1.  It must not require remote access from outside the base network and firewall.  
3.2.  It must integrate into the base network infrastructure without requiring modifications to the infrastructure itself.  
3.3.  It should conform to all base network security protocols.
	3.3.1.  Server/client machines must remain current with all Microsoft Operating System security patches and upgrades.
	3.3.2.  It must be certified as virus-free before integration into the base network.
3.3.3.  Vendor must allow technicians to examine operating code prior to installation.  Vendor will submit code review through the Contracting Officer Representative (COR).  
4.  Upgrades.  Software must be available for upgrades as the needs of the 48th Fighter Wing change or adapt to operations.
4.1.  Solution must be configurable for software upgrades to enhance capabilities or streamline its current operation.
4.2.  Upgrades that are required to address security issues (i.e. a flaw was discovered in the initial configuration) will be provided at no cost to the government.
4.3.  Vendor must provide an option for future enhancement upgrades (i.e. introduction of new audio-visual medium, administrative controls, or configuration enhancements).
5.  Technical Support.  Vendor will make personnel available to provide telephone and in-person technical support.
5.1.	Vendor will provide a technical support hotline at all hours to assist our personnel with software operations issues.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to respond to technical questions submitted against RFP Number N00173-05-R-RS01.  The Government hereby responds to the following questions: 
QUESTION 1:  Does the reference to remote control in the RFP mean by cable or wireless control? What distance is applicable to this requirement? ANSWER 1: Remote control by cable over a minimum 100-foot distance from the camera to the control is required.
QUESTION 2: According to the published literature, the SPS-500 Pedestal has a maximum acceleration of 90 deg/sec/sec.  Is the requirement of 500 deg/sec/sec an error?  If not, how long must it sustain 500 deg/sec/sec?  ANSWER 2: A nominal angular acceleration of 90 degrees/sec/sec shall be demonstrated with the maximum payload of 75 lbs.  The referenced 500 degrees/sec/sec represents a not-to-exceed value.
QUESTION 3: Reference the requirement to interface in a functionally and operationally compatible manner with infrared and visible range cameras currently in use at NRL.  Does this mean to support these cameras, or to use the signals from these cameras for tracking purposes?  ANSWER 3: The required tracking system shall provide for physical support and mounting of infrared- and visible-band cameras, and shall allow for use of the signal from either a visible or mid-wave infrared band camera, which will be chosen at the discretion of the Government, in tracking.  QUESTION 4: Reference the requirement to retrofit a functionally and operationally compatible gyroscope.  Will the required gyroscope be supplied by the customer or the vendor?
ANSWER 4: Neither.  The Government has no immediate need for a gyroscope. However, the Offeror is required to recommend in their proposal a gyroscope that is functionally and operationally compatible to the required pedestal system should the need for increased stabilization arise at a future time.  
QUESTION 5: Is a yoke required or will a platform mounted on one side with the correct payload capability be acceptable?
ANSWER 5: Proposed solutions to the Government's requirements are solely the responsibility of the Offeror.
