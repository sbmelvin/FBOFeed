<STAUTH>FAR 6.302-1
<AWDNBR>W912PQ-11-F-0077
<AWDDATE>040311
<DESC><p>03 Apr 11</p>
<p>Justification and Approval for Other Than Full and Open Competition</p>
<p>1. This document constitutes justification and approval for other than full and open competition for the acquisition described herein, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. It is executed on behalf of 174th Operations Squadron.</p>
<p>2. The 174 FW proposes to procure by means of other than full and open competition Vindicator Service. FES Installations installed the Head End system last year for the Main Vindicator System. Another company working and installing components to the Head End System will compromise the systems integrity and warranty.</p>
<p>3. The purchase is at a cost of $3,821<br /><br />4. Identification of statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.</p>
<p>a. FAR 6.302-1, only one source responsible and no other services will satisfy the Government</p>
<p>b. 10 USC 2304(c)(2)</p>
<p>5. Demonstrate that the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.</p>
<p>This procurement is for a purchase order to obtain Vindicator Service for Bldg 800. The statutory authority cited is FAR 6.302-1, Only one source responsible and no other services will satisfy the Government, is necessary as delay in award of this contract would result in serious injury, financial or other, to the government. This is for Vindicator Security System Service Maintenance. FES has installed this system and maintains a warranty on these parts. FES also installed the Head End System for the base. If we were to allow another company to add components or work on the FES system we would not only compromise the integrity of the system but we would void the warranty on the existing system. All prices are deemed fair and reasonable.</p>
<p><br />CONTRACTING OFFICER CERTIFICATION</p>
<p>I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Leanne S Holmes, TSgt, NYANG<br />Contracting Officer</p>
