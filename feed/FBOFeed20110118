<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), Division of Laboratory Sciences, intends to award a sole source contract to Luminex, 12212 Technology Boulevard, Austin, TX, 78727-6115 for the acquisition of a maintenance agreement for all Luminex instruments.<br /><br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 811219, Other Electronic and Precision Equipment Repair and Maintenance. The period of performance for this procurement is a 12 month base period and four 12 month options. <br /><br />The pieces of equipment are essential to the laboratory work of the Newborn Screening Molecular Biology Branch. As such, they are in continuous use and must be maintained appropriately to ensure accuracy and quality results. Luminex is the original equipment manufacturer of the instruments. As such, they provide the best service for their instruments with annual preventative maintenance service as well as emergency on-site support in the event that the instrument fails to work properly. For on-site support, the vendor will supply Luminex-trained personnel with continuous updates on suggested methods of instrument correction.<br />&nbsp;
<p>Additionally, Luminex provides service manuals to engineers containing service procedures applicable to the equipment trained on. Engineers periodically receive service information and updates, often consisting of compilations of recent problems and suggested methods of correction.</p>
<p>As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to Luminex. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide the services to Vallerie Redd via email ONLY at gfj3@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 2010-Q-13118 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN February 2, 2011.<br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Injury Prevention and Control Health (NCIPC), Division of Unintentional Injury Prevention, intends to award a sole source contract to the National Council on Aging, 1901 L Street, 4th Floor, Washington, DC 20036 for the purchase of consulting services and related products. <br /><br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 813319, Other Social Advocacy Organizations. The period of performance for this procurement is 12 months. <br /><br />The National Council on Aging (NCOA) has the trust and cooperation of the members of the National Falls Free Coalition (NFFC), which will allow them to work cooperatively and to quickly identify, adopt and evaluate policy strategies. NCOA organized, built and has led the NFFC since 2004, and maintains the records of conference calls, contacts and committee activities. NCOA was instrumental in creating a number of National Advisory Working Groups composed of select NFFC members. Through the work of these Working Groups, NCOA can document the remarkable progress in infrastructure development that has occurred at the state and community levels. By actively promoting collaboration among its members and networks, NCOA has demonstrated a unique ability to reach deep into communities across the country, to promote partnerships, and to stimulate and implement evidence-based fall prevention initiatives. No other organization can demonstrate this relevant range of activities and accomplishments.<br />&nbsp;
<p>The National Safety Council, Safe States Alliance and Fall Prevention Center for Excellence were the other three organizations considered to define policy change strategies for falls prevention and to promote implementation of these strategies by members of the National Falls Free Coalition, guided by the approaches as outlined in the National Falls Action Plan. These three organizations have the experience to help define policy change strategies as they relate to falls prevention. However, they lack strong established partnerships and relationships with the National Falls Free<sup>TM</sup> Coalition (NFFC). The NFFC was organized by NCOA to provide an ongoing structure for leading organizations to move forward on one or more of the National Action Plan strategies that resonated with their organizational missions. In five years, the NFFC has grown to include 70 national and international member organizations. In 2006, the NFFC expanded to include six state falls coalitions that were organized to address this growing public health issue at the state level.</p>
<p>NCOA has established regular and ongoing communications with the state falls coalitions via conference calls, newsletters, workgroups, and periodic progress evaluations. None of the other organizations have this established relationship; they would need to spend considerable time and resources to create a similar working relationship in order to promote adoption of policy change strategies by the state coalitions.</p>
<p>NCOA is the only organization that can develop policy statements as needed, have them adopted through the NFFC and document the progress of implementation. <br /><br />As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to the National Council on Aging. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide the services to Ronnell Booker via email ONLY at eqf2@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 2010-Q-13108 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN December 22, 2010. <br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Division of Surveillance, Hazard Evaluations and Field Studies (DSHEFS) has a requirement for follow-on support for the Endicott Retrospective Chemical Exposure Assessment.
<p>NIOSH is conducting an epidemiologic cohort study of a former IBM plant located at Endicott, New York, that has produced a variety of microelectronic components as well as equipment associated with accounting, printing and computing machines. A chemical exposure assessment is needed in conjunction with the epidemiologic study. Electronic data as well as hard-copy documents containing information related to potential chemical exposure have been obtained by NIOSH from the former operator of the site. These records contain information generated by the Endicott site industrial hygiene organization through the past several decades. The records do not cover the entire period of the study and the data contained are not directly suitable for determination of worker exposures suitable for epidemiologic study. An exposure assessment database is being developed by NIOSH to combine the electronic records and data coded from the hard copy records to make these data available for study. The goal of the epidemiology study is to determine if associations exist between employment at the site and certain health outcomes. The study will additionally attempt to determine whether associations exist between these health outcomes and the type of exposure potentially experienced by workers.</p>
<p>The goal of the exposure assessment is to use historical site records, and other appropriate information, to identify important chemical agents which have been used at the site, to develop categories to group individuals with similar potential for exposure over time, and to associate the study cohort of site workers with these exposure-based categories so that exposure-based epidemiologic analyses can be performed. The Endicott retrospective chemical exposure assessment was begun in 2009 and is planned for completion in 2011.</p>
<p>Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written item description/item characteristics and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward the item description and pricing information to Denise Rains, Purchasing Agent, Reference: 2011-Q-13185, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Acquisition and Assistance Field Branch (Spokane), 315 East Montgomery Avenue, Spokane, WA or email dgr8@cdc.gov. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov.<br /><br />The Government will review any/all item descriptions and pricing information submitted</p>

Each unit is defined as one tower equipped with a suite of sensors <br />for persistent wide area surveillance and supporting power and communications.&nbsp; For an <br />Area of Interest (AoI) where CBP has determined that IFT systems are the preferred wide <br />area persistent surveillance solution, the systems will detect and track IoIs.&nbsp; The system <br />will automatically identify IoIs (i.e., human, animal, conveyance, other), and provide agents <br />with Full Motion Video (FMV) to do so manually.&nbsp; The FMV will also enable the COP <br />operators to classify the threat in terms of group size, whether they are migrant workers, <br />smugglers, etc, and whether they are armed.&nbsp; IoI data from one or more IFT units will be <br />shown geospatially on a COP.&nbsp; The COP display will present IoI information in a manner <br />that enables a COP operator to manage the IoIs across an AoI, incorporating feeds from <br />legacy systems where possible. A COP operator will be responsible for monitoring the COP, <br />managing, and prioritizing the IoIs, coordinating IoI data with field agents, and using the <br />IFT system to vector responding agents to an IoI.&nbsp; Finally, the system will record and archive <br />data for later retrieval.&nbsp; The system will be used under adverse and extreme weather <br />conditions and in harsh environments such as deserts and rugged, mountainous terrain <br />where access is limited. </span></span></p>

<DESC>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Office of Acquisitions Station Support Simplified Acquisitions Branch on behalf of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) intends to negotiate, on a non-competitive basis, with SIEMENS MEDICAL SOLUTIONS USA INC., 51 Valley Stream Parkway, Malvern, PA 19355, for an ACUSON S2000 Ultrasound System. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) and FAR 13.501 (a)(1) to use Simplified Acquisition Procedure for commercial items.<br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System Code for this acquisition is 334516 and the size standard is 500 employees.<br /><br />The NINDS Division of Intramural Research is conducting studies on Muscular Dystrophy in children using Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse Imaging. Muscular dystrophies are a genetically heterogeneous group of degenerative muscle disorders, most commonly with onset in childhood. The NINDS researchers hypothesize that acoustic radiation force (ARF) imaging can be used to non-invasively assess the stiffness of dystrophic muscle tissue and that the degree of stiffness of the tissue is dependent on the degree and extent of fibrosis, inflammation, and fatty deposition within the muscle. The NINDS researchers&nbsp;further hypothesize that the degree of physical tissue change as measured by MP-ARF will directly reflect the severity of involvement of the muscle and thereby correlated with the overall clinical state of the patient, thus qualifying ARF imaging as a noninvasive biomarker for the disease. The NINDS researchers plan to validate MP-ARF imaging in eighteen (18) children and young adults (ages 6-21) with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and with congenital muscular dystrophy (collagen VI related and merosin deficient types) over time and compared to a cohort of normal children and young adults. ARF ultrasound has the capability follow the development of fibro-fatty changes in the muscle by noninvasive means and thus could be an important tool to define the natural history of the muscular dystrophies and to serve as an outcome measure for therapeutic trials in the muscular dystrophies, including those that directly indirectly modulate fibrosis. For this to become a clinically useful tool to be applicable to predominantly pediatric patient population, it should ideally be noninvasive, not require sedation, and have the potential for a safe serial application. Ultrasound imaging ideally fulfills these requirements.<br /><br />NINDS staff&nbsp;has investigated the market and found that SIEMENS S-2000 is the only high-end ultrasound machine capable of high resolution imaging up to 18MHz, optimized for musculoskeletal applications. The SIEMENS S-2000 is equipped with elastography and with ARFI (acoustic radiation force impulse) imaging capability, referred as "Virtual-Touch" imaging. The SIEMENS S-2000 currently is the only machine approved for human use that has ARFI capability.<br /><br />It is essential that the SIEMENS S-2000 with ARFI capability be purchased to allow the NINDS researchers to continue with the ongoing studies. This SIEMENS S-2000 is available only through SIEMENS. No other source of supplies or products will satisfy the agency's requirement.<br /><br />Delivery will be F.O.B. Destination and to be shipped to NIH Bethesda campus. Ultrasound Apps Training 2 days is to be included and provided by the vendor.<br /><br />No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses submitted to ln18x@nih.gov on or before 2:00 PM ET January 27, 2011. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the government to determine if it can meet the above specifications described herein. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Please reference the announcement number NOI-1922830 on all correspondence.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center (SPAWARSYSCEN) Atlanticintends to issue a sole source contract to M.C. Dean, Inc., 22461 Shaw Road,Dulles, VA  20166. This procurement will act as a bridge to the follow-oncontract which will be a competitively awarded Multiple Award Contract. Thisbridge is for work that is currently being performed under N65236-07-D-5884,which involves OCONUS electronic security support services to Navy and Jointcustomers in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East.  The sole source award willbeissued pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(B) as the incumbent contractor is theonly known source available to satisfy the agency need for continued support ofcritical upgrades already in progress while the new contract is competed andawarded.  The time-consuming process of transitioning a new contractor at thistime, including getting required TESA approvals at the contract and individuallevel from the host nations, would result in an unacceptable gap in servicethatcould leave critical facilities unsecured or unable to be utilized.
A Firm-Fixed-Price contract is anticipated.  The applicable North AmericanIndustry Classification (NAIC) Code is 541330 and the size standard is $27Million.
THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT AND IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVEPROPOSALS.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION OR SOLICITATION FOR PLANNING PURPOSES (OCT 1997) (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. (b) Although proposal and offeror are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only, it shall not be used as a proposal. (c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of obtaining information to serve as a market survey to aid in research associated with the potential development of a Power System for small unmanned aerial systems and munitions. The government does not presently intend to award a contract, but desires information on risk, capability, price, innovative research and development methodology and other information in planning the development of a Power System.  This is a Request for Information (RFI) issued pursuant to FAR 15.2. The U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) Redstone Arsenal, AL, on behalf of the U.S. Army, desires to obtain information to serve as a market survey to aid in research associated with the development of a Power System designed to provide motive and electronics power to small unmanned aerial systems and munitions over the full range of stated environmental operating and storage requirements.  As a result of issuing this RFI, the Government expects to receive technical, programmatic, and innovative methodology data to assist in the following: (1) Determine the ability of current and near term Power System technology to support small unmanned aerial systems and munitions, (2) Identify feasible alternatives that meet the objectives stated below, (3) Determine the approximate research and development cost and schedule, and end-item cost information for each alternative, and (4) Determine the estimated performance characteristics and risks associated with each alternative. Interested and capable sources are asked to submit a white paper containing a description of the above areas of interest.  Information on available, emerging, or required technologies and how these technologies could be applied to this project should also be included.  Technical objectives: A high power and energy-density full temperature-range battery or other electrical energy storage system is needed to produce power for small all-electric unmanned aerial systems and munitions.  This power is used to produce motive force for the vehicle as well as provide power for the on-board electronics.  Propulsion power is by far the largest requirement and the most dynamic of all on-board systems.  The system is to be able to produce the full peak power requirement (flyout) upon initiation, including after cold temperature soak.  Primary reserve batteries, active primary batteries, secondary (rechargeable) batteries, fuel cells or alternative system technologies are sought which will meet the prescribed system requirements.  Predicted sizes, weights and performance are given based on anticipated test bed hardware, but the final system configuration is not known at present.  The candidate shall fit within a space of 120,000 cubic millimeters, with weight not to exceed 300 grams.  The preferred dimensions are 105 x 57 x 20 mm, but other configurations are of interest.  Output voltage shall be nominally 24V, with 18.0V minimum, and 24.6V maximum.  The system may be energized at power levels on the order of 10W for up to 2 minutes prior to flight.  The candidate shall be capable of producing 500W (23 Amps) for a duration of approximately 10 seconds upon initiation even at the cold-soak operating temperature of -32C.    The candidate shall then be capable of delivering an average of 160W comprised of swings from 10W minimum to 340W maximum for the duration of the mission.  The load rate of change is approximately 2000W per second (.002W per microsecond).  The candidate shall produce a total energy of 50,000 J minimum for duration of at least 300 seconds (Threshold) or 150,000J minimum for duration of at least 900 seconds (Objective) over the full operating temperature range.  The Operating Temperature range is -32C to 60C.  The candidate shall have a shelf life of greater than 6 months (Threshold) or greater than 5 years (Objective) within the Storage Temperature range of -51C to +71C.  The candidate shall be able to operate at altitudes greater than 5000 feet above MSL (Mean Sea Level) (Threshold) or greater than 14000 feet MSL (Objective).  For rechargeable systems only, the candidate must retain 90 percent of full charge for greater than 3 months (Threshold) or 6 months (Objective) without recharging.  Recharging time, if applicable, is to be 1.0 hour maximum.  The power system must be capable of withstanding launch shock loads of approximately 1000 g's over 6 milliseconds at the operating temperatures specified.  The purpose of this RFI is to gather information about those top level requirements enumerated above.  To the extent simplifying assumptions are needed, respondents are encouraged to make and document such assumptions in their responses.  Responses: To assist in research associated with the potential development of a Power System for small unmanned aerial systems and munitions, the government is requesting information from industry.  Interested parties should submit white papers not to exceed 15 pages and no smaller than 12pt Times New Roman font.  Responses may include multiple concept submittals.  The government encourages creativity in responses to this RFI.  The white paper should include the following:  (1) A brief description of one or more conceptual alternatives for the Power System for small unmanned aerial systems and munitions including associated components, (2) An overall feasibility assessment of each alternative and how each meets the objectives stated above.  (3) A candidate high-level implementation roadmap that includes transition points, (4) Power System cost drivers and cost tradeoffs and a preliminary cost estimate for each of the alternatives should be provided to include research and development costs, and cost per system for quantities of 500, 2000, and 20,000, (5), A high-level risk assessment for each alternative that articulates the respondent's understanding of associated risks and risk mitigation approaches, (6) An estimate of Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) of components and the power system as a whole, (7) A brief description of any projects that the respondent's company is or has been involved in that are similar in concept to what is described in this RFI.  This should include any relevant lessons learned, (8) Any additional materials that are deemed appropriate by the respondent.   The objective of this process is to assess current and future products and technologies capable of achieving the stated Power System objectives.  After RFI release, there will be a period of for question submittal.  All questions must be submitted in writing and reference the RFI number no later than 3:00 CST on 3 February 2011 to the contractual point of contact Lisa Duncan at lisa.d.duncan@us.army.mil; telephone requests for addition information will not be honored.   Request must include: Company name, Commerical and Government Entity (CAGE) code, and appropriate point of contact information. All questions must be submitted in writing (e-mail) and reference the RFI number; telephone requests for additional information will not be honored.  All RFI responses must be submitted to the technical point of contact, Bill McMahan, 256-876-7626, bill.mcmahan@us.army.mil no later than 3:00 PM Central Standard Time (CST) on 7 March 2011 to the technical point of contact.  The government requests that the respondents deliver one electronic soft copy in Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF format.   In addition to the information provided above, all responses to this RFI must include the RFI number, company or institution name, Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, and point of contact information.

Introduction
The U.S.
 Navy (USN) has employed high powered acoustic hailing device (AHD) systems of several sizes and designs for use as warning devices employed in Anti-terrorism / Force Protection (ATFP) missions over the past several years.  The success of these systems is causing the body of performance requirements to evolve to meet the specific capability requirements of large and small deck naval surface ships, submarines, security boats, shore security operations and others.  There is an even wider span of requirements potentially evolving across all services, the U.S. Coast Guard and the U.S. Merchant Marine.  This is leading to the formation of a FAMILY OF SYSTEMS design concept, where some level of commonality of mounting, controlling and support requirements for spare parts, training, and user documentation becomes an important management concern.
The USN is seeking commercial sources that may be capable of responding to a future solicitation for moveable/portable, commercial off the shelf (COTS) Naval Audio/Visual Warning Devices (AVWD), earlier referred to as the Acoustic Hailing Device (AHD) and used for Anti-Terrorism / Force Protection purposes.
  This RFI is seeking vendors and their product and technology applications that may be applied in three main areas to continue the capability development of the USNs mobile AVWD systems.  These areas of development are:  (1) achieve current capability, but with improvements in size and weight reduction, maintainability, and portability (family of systems);  (2) include audio and visual technology enhancements that raise the effectiveness of the warning device (i.e., higher SPL output, longer range, visual warnings and/or deterrents);  (3) include certain new effector and sensor capabilities, and specific interface standards and remote control options to achieve and extend all prior capability requirements while offering new options for use in the ATFP mission environment.
  The possibility exists that these three areas of capability could be implemented in a phased-in approach depending on the maturity of existing capabilities.
The Government is seeking informational responses from vendors to address and summarize existing and near-term capabilities which would potentially meet the needs of these three areas or phases of capabilities outlined below.
Capability 1
Design using the concept of a FAMILY OF SYSTEMS is meant to gain a high level of parts, control system and operations / maintenance commonality, while introducing a series of systems that form a spectrum or span of portability ranging from man-carried and battery powered models to systems suitable for small boat or vehicle application to mounted systems for combatant and support ships, recognizing that this also implies a span of performance capability in acoustic energy output and other effects.
  One desire is to increase current hailer capabilities (SPL output and distance) while reducing the size and weight of hailer units.

Capability 2
Audio and visual technology enhancements are desired to increase the capability of stand-alone hailer devices.  Information is being sought on features and capabilities which can be provided or added to hailer units, such as advanced acoustic deterrent capabilities, and the ability to add peripheral devices to the hailer units.

Capability 3 
The capabilities which may be required in the future solicitation will contain specific interface and control system design attributes which are improvements from earlier AHD solicitations.  The potential design concept for the next generation moveable AVWD is one which will feature a standard Control Device (CD), an Integrated Head (IH) containing multiple effectors and sensors, and a standard mount design for use on Naval surface ships of various classes, with some of these features potentially being options to stand-alone devices.
  In order to achieve optimal design goals, these three components of the AVWD system will be treated separately and the performance specification will fully establish detailed interface requirements.  To accomplish this, any potential future AVWD requirements may include necessary system performance and system interface requirements. The goal of this RFI is to discover the maturity of needed technologies and the readiness of the potential vendor base to respond to a solicitation employing this design concept. Figure 1 illustrates the design concept of three subsystems separated by subsystem boundaries.
 

These typical or proposed performance requirements should be viewed as STARTER MATERIAL leading to refinement and further development, and not as hard values that will be contained in a forthcoming solicitation package.
  Fleet requirements and operational employment is currently under development, so all capabilities cited here may not actually be specified in the first of several or any future solicitation.  These design concepts may be introduced by way of a sequence of solicitations containing either unique capabilities and performance requirements, or requirements for a series of products with two or more levels of total capability.  Operational requirements will drive the selection of performance criteria, and knowledge gained by the Navy through this RFI of the capability of the commercial sector to provide certain capabilities will help to form those operational employment requirements.
Capabilities of the Control Device (CD)
The CD will be the primary user interface, and will be capable of: (1) controlling all warning functions of the AVWD system for various versions of IH and (2) displaying system status and video (if an IH video camera is specified).
 The CD configuration item shall host the list of functions shown below.  A future design consideration may include remote control of the IH.  The addition of remote motion control functionality would include or invoke CD functions numbered 22 and 23.
1.	CD powered by ships 120V AC, single phase power
2.	CD converts and / or conditions electrical power for its own use
3.	Power on and off the IH and CD

5.	Receive pre-recorded MP3 format voice messages and tone signals from a standard desktop computer running Windows XP operating system
6.	Controls audio transmission parameters of the IH, e.g. volume, duration, beam width, and special functions
7.	Store digital pre-recorded voice messages and tone signals
8.	Transmit live microphone signals to the IH
9.	Transmit pre-recorded tone signals to the IH
10.	Transmit pre-recorded voice messages to the IH
11.	Power on / off a mounted low-light safety camera
12.	Control Safety Camera focus / zoom / field of view
13.	Decode  h.264 format digital video imagery
14.	Display camera imagery at or on the CD
15.	Record / playback camera video imagery
16.	Store up to 3 hours of recorded camera imagery
17.	Power on / off a mounted visual warning device
18.	Control beam width and related visual warning device functions
19.	In case of power interruption, time to reboot shall be less than 1 minute
20.	CD designed to meet requirements of portable electrical power equipment per MIL-STD-1310H; i.e.
 any exposed metal must be grounded to the safety return
21.	Other typical surface ship environmental qualification and user interface requirements shall be established
22.	Pan / tilt control of mounted IH, a pan and tilt rate will be established in a future performance specification
23.	Setup and administer software stops for pan / tilt limits of motion
Capabilities of the Integrated Head (IH)
In this design concept, the IH component hosts all sensor and effector functions, including all digital signal processing of inputs received from the CD, signal amplification, an OEM unique alert tone, video signal encoding and transmission to the CD, and any / all other controls of audio and visual outputs.
  The principle functions and key performance requirements are listed below.
1.	IH converts and / or conditions electrical power received from ships 120 VAC power source for its use
2.	IH receives and interprets commands from the CD to control audio and visual emission characteristics
3.	Control of IH primary functions (Live Microphone, Alert Tone, Visual Warning Device, Audio and Visual output controls (volume, special effects etc.) will be accessible on the IH device in addition to being controlled by the CD 
4.	IH shall be man-steerable or steered remotely. A remotely steered version shall also be man-steerable in a casualty mode. OEMs should indicate whether they are capable of offering either configuration or both.
5.	Man-steerable IH shall require an aiming site with height of eye when above the deck not exceeding 5 feet-0 inches mounted on the mount subsystem
6.	IH shall be capable of producing a minimum sound pressure level of 125 dB at 1 meter for any frequency in the total band width (exact requirements for different sized systems TBD)
7.	IH frequency response range objective shall include 300  7000 Hz  with less than 10 dB drop SPL
8.	IH transmission distance shall be based on Sound Transmission Intelligibility (STI) index of minimum 0.3
9.	IH main and side lobe beam widths or estimating method will be established in a future solicitation
10.	Audio harmonic distortion limits shall be established in the future, and they will be measured using a spectrum analyzer sweeping the full bandwidth, inspecting the frequency response for the amplitude of 3rd order harmonic components
11.	The physical size and weight envelope will be established for different models of the AVWD family of systems
12.	The man-steered IH shall be limited to 105 lbs maximum excluding mount
13.	Visual warning device shall be capable of illuminating a 7 meter RHIB-like surface target at night at a range of 500 yards over water
14.	Visual Warning device shall have variable beam width and related visual warning functions
15.	In case of power interruption, time to reboot IH shall be less than 20 seconds
16.	IH designed to meet requirements of portable electrical power equipment per MIL-STD-1310H; i.e.
 any exposed metal must be grounded to the safety return
17.	Other typical surface ship environmental qualification and user interface requirements shall be established
18.	Remote pan/tilt controlled IH shall include hard and software pan / tilt motion stops
19.	A performance specification for pan and tilt rate will be established

Capabilities of the Mount Subsystem

In this design concept, the functions of the mount subsystem are: (a) support the weight of the IH, and (b) provide pass-through connections for ships 120V AC power and Ethernet control signals of the IH. Essential design attributes include: (a) ease of mount and dismount of the IH device, (b) protection from weather and foot traffic of the power and communication lines, and (c) standardized attachment point and bolt pattern that will permit various IH devices to be mounted, powered and controlled.
 A highly desirable design trait allows this mount design to accommodate both man-steered and remote motion controlled IH devices.  Another important design trait is minimization of the foot-print of the mount subsystem so that mounts may be more easily installed in multiple positions on each shipgiving the crew flexibility on where to mount their IH devices as the tactical condition requires.

Nominal values for design assumptions and parameters are as follows:

1.	Mount will resist vertical weight load of 200 lbs
2.	Mount will resist bending moment of 1000 lbs force through a radius arm of 5 feet (5000 ft-lbs)
3.	Mount will be composed of steel, compatible with naval ship deck and superstructure material (MIL-S-22698 GR DH-36)
4.	An aluminum variant may be required, and as such, the design concept should be extensible to aluminum.
 Assume use of a grade of aluminum with minimum 40 KSI Ultimate Tensile strength
5.	Power and Ethernet stuffing tubes and connectors shall be compatible with mount materials and with cable connectors provided by IH device to be mounted

Conclusion

The goals of this RFI are: (1) advise the field of manufacturers of near-future intentions for Navy AVWD system design goals, (2) discover manufacturers who have technologies useful and/or adaptable to use in this new AVWD system architecture, (3) gather information that will be useful in developing necessary system interface specifications (S/S Boundaries A through D, pictured), (4) discover control technologies that will advance the Navys capability for remotely controlling the multi-functional AVWD family of devices that may be fielded in the near future.
  An additional desire is discovery of any advanced acoustic capabilities which would be beneficial to these systems and the associated AT/FP missions.

The navy believes that participation by industry in this RFI will allow the development of a performance specification and set of interface designs that will be then be (a) clear to industry when a solicitation is released, (b) competitive and (c) relevant to mission needs of the operating forces.

<DESC>The Commandant of the Marine Corps, Personal and Family ReadinessDivision (MR) is seeking qualified sources to provide an update to theFamily Advocacy Program Services Desk Reference Guide.  This is apreliminary notification only to seek potentially interested sources for theservice; it is not a request for proposal or quotations.  The MR is anon-appropriated funds instrumentality (NAF) operating as part of the staffof the Marine Corps Commandant.  The Family Advocacy Program (FAP) is amulti-faceted program which addresses family violence through prevention,advocacy, intervention, and treatment of domestic abuse and child abuse.Military families are assisted through programs in Prevention, New ParentSupport, Victim Advocacy, and Clinical Counseling.  The FAP currently maintains a clinical desk reference guide that serves asa one-stop location for all program material within the clinical counselingarena.  The goal of this initiative is to broaden the desk reference guideto include all FAP program areas and to update the material to ensure it isfocused on the latest treatment modalities.  The guide also needs to includeupdated forms and resources flowing from the Marine Corps FAP Order.

The provider shall serve as systems integrator for all programs within the MILSATCOM enterprise, responsible for integration and analysis of all aspects, including resolution of technical and schedule issues involving program contractors and stakeholders.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Industry Day meeting is to exchange preliminary information with industry and to solicit input on the Government's performance work statement document as part of the Government's market research and acquisition planning activities.

<p>All interested parties are invited to attend the Government's presentation on the program and enterprise overview. One-on-one sessions will be made by appointment and last no more than 45 minutes. Seating is limited for the side sessions, so contractor teams must limit personnel to 10 for these sessions. All attending personnel must provide their full name and social security number to Maj Michael Russell (michael.russell@losangeles.af.mil) NLT 1700 on 28 Jan 11 in order to ensure base access can be granted.

<DESC>This is not a Request for Project Proposals, but for planning purposes only. Aproject award will not be awarded from this announcement. 
The Government intends to announce a Request for Project Proposals for execution of an award in support of a Ground Robotics related research area. The purpose of this announcement is to provide members of the Robotics Technology Consortium, and industry in general, advanced notification of Government intent. In December 2007, the Government announced its intent to enter into an Other Transaction Agreement with one (1) consortium in support of Ground Robotics related Research and Development projects. As a result of the Ground Robotics Industry Day in January 2008, one (1) consortium formed, the Robotics Technology Consortium. It is the intent of the Government to make project award(s) to the members of the Robotics Technology Consortium as a result of member project proposals submitted via the Request for Project Proposals. 
The anticipated Research Area for which project proposals will be sought is as follows: End-Effector Interface Family. The Request for Project Proposals (W15QKN-08-9-0001-RPP11) will be issued to the Robotics Technology Consortiums Administrative Agent, the National Center for Manufacturing Sciences, who will then issue the request to the members of the Consortium.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA), Public Buildings Services, National Capital Region, Washington, DC intends to issue a sole source contract in accordance with FAR 6.302-2 for a 3-month performance period from February 1, 2011, through April 30, 2011, with two 2-month option periods. The current contract, set to expire January 31, 2011, provides Commercial Facility Management Services (CFM) for the Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATFE) Building located at 99 New York Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20002.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>While GSA believes it may post a combined synopsis and solicitation for this requirement as soon as mid-January 2011, ATFE's stringent security requirements do not allow sufficient time for GSA to procure these services without encountering a lapse and/or impairment of services.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, this sole source extension is necessary to bridge the gap between the current contract and the new award, thereby ensuring the overlap of contract performance required for the achievement of a smooth transition and continuous high-level service.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Description of the work to be performed: The contractor is to furnish all material, labor, equipment, supervision and services necessary to perform full CFM for a six (6) month period, inclusive of the aforementioned options, for the ATFE Building. The contractor will be responsible for full building management services and is fully responsible for the management, customer service, operation, mechanical maintenance, janitorial services, elevator operations and maintenance, snow removal, energy management, management of parking facilities, loading dock, trash facilities, utility systems and quality control and engineering of the facility and of the associated grounds with all necessary labor, materials, supplies, technical support and value engineering.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(2) as cited in FAR 6.302-2, "Unusual and compelling urgency."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This extension is issued to facilitate continuation of services. A lapse in service will have a highly detrimental effect on the ability of the ATFE to provide its services to the public. This extension will provide services without disruption for the operation of the ATFE Building by a firm that holds current high-level security clearances and that is also familiar with the complexity of the facility and the equipment. Potomac Services, Inc. is the incumbent CFM contractor and is fully capable of continuing to perform for the additional 6-month performance period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, as no solicitation package will be issued. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation which will be considered by the agency.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Such submittals shall be transmitted via e-mail to Jerome Lofton at <a href="mailto:Jerome.lofton@gsa.gov">Jerome.lofton@gsa.gov</a> <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span></strong> Aisha Massac at <a href="mailto:aisha.massac@gsa.gov">aisha.massac@gsa.gov</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS

Justification and Approval
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition

1.	Contracting Organization:  Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Acquisition, Washington DC.

2.	Description of Action:  The Office of Acquisition proposes to negotiate a noncompetitive award with BNF Technologies, Inc., for contract closeout services.

3.	Description of Supplies or Services:  The Office of Acquisition has a critical need to   closeout numerous contract files related to operational acquisition support for the VA Central Office (VACO).  There are estimated 6,865 contracting actions ready for closeout, spanning a two-year timeframe.  The period of performance will consist of a base year and one option year (at an estimated dollar value of $1,129,419 per each year of performance).
	The contract closeout services will require the Contractor to utilize several skill sets at various levels of capability, such as: accounting skills for the reconciliation of funding and rate determinations; analytical skills to verify completed performance and for the disposition of Government property; acquisition experience and training to properly execute closeouts under the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR); and the ability to manage the logistics, physical control, and security over procurement-sensitive Government files.	 

4.	Statutory Authority:  The statutory exception permitting other than full and open competition for this acquisition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(5), Authorized or Required by Statute as implemented by FAR 6.302-5.  The applicable statute is PL 109-461, Veterans First Contracting Program (codified at 38 U.S.C.  8127 and 8128).
   
5.	Reason for Cited Authority:  It is has been determined that a "sole source" Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) award will be made to BNF Technologies, Inc., of Arlington, VA, under PL 109-461 pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 8127(c).  The Contracting Officer has validated the contractor is certified as an SDVOSB in the Vendor Information Pages (VIP) database and qualifies as "small" in accordance with the federal small business size standards for the applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this procurement (541611).

6.	Efforts to Obtain Competition:  Market research was conducted in VetBiz.gov to indentify a single SDVOSB firm (under VA's statutory authority) capable of meeting the Government's known requirement at this time.  Consistent with the guidelines of the Veterans First Contracting Program, the proposed contracting action described herein will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities website in accordance with FAR Part 5. 

7.	Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price:  The anticipated price to the Government is $2,258,838 for the base year and the one-year option.  No award will be made until the Contracting Officer determines the price to the Government to be fair and reasonable.  This determination will be based on a comparison of the vendor's proposed price to the Government's Independent Government Cost Estimate, as well as appropriate price analysis techniques.

8.	Market Research:  Market research was conducted by searching the VetBiz.gov database on January 11, 2011.  The selected SDVOSB firm, BNF Technologies, Inc., of Arlington, VA, has successfully been providing similar contract closeout services for the Department of Commerce.  Based on assessment of the firm's capabilities, BNF Technologies, Inc., is found capable of meeting the Government's requirements for this contracting action.  

9.	Other Considerations:  The Contracting Officer has determined this proposed contracting action meets the requirements of the statute 38 U.S.C. 8127(c) and is below the statute's procurement threshold of $5MIL.  In addition, the Contracting Officer will ensure BNF Technologies, Inc., of Arlington, VA, meets the standards for responsibility prior to award (in accordance with FAR 9.1).

10.	Listing of Sources Expressing Interest:  No sources have expressed written interest in this acquisition.

11.	Statement of Actions to Remove or Overcome Barriers to Future Competition:  The Government's future requirements are unknown at this time.  Any future requirements for contract closeout services will be handled on a case-by-case basis to determine the acquisition strategy. 

12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify the technical requirement outlined in this justification is a bonafide need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

This is a follow and final NAVICP spares buy of AYC-1477 Kit numbers 1477LKA144510XX depot level installation kits and 1477LKB144511XX NAVICP spare depot level installation kits.
<p><br />ECP 323 Nose Landing Gear Steering Dowel Pins are manufactured from 174CRES material and treated with OEM owned proprietary processes in order that they meet the strength and fatigue requirements called for in the engineering change and qualification test requirements and the OEM's analysis of the root failure mode of the original equipment. Purchase of these pins from any source other than the OEM would require re-qualification and certification and the U.S. Government does not have data rights to the special proprietary process used by the OEM to meet the qualification requirements. Therefore, the U.S. Government could not supply them to any other interested party.</p>

The incumbent shall provide specialized technical information to a wide variety of senior program and technical specialists in the area of prevention. As the HIV Prevention Advisor, the incumbent shall work on both implementation and as a subject matter specialist; serve as Agreement Officer's Technical Representative (AOTR) and activity manager for implementation and research agreements focused on prevention; monitor activities undertaken by implementing partners (IPs) implementing prevention programs/projects/activities, track progress against program descriptions, implementation plans, and work plans, assess progress and barriers to achievement, recommend action for improvement of modifications to address problems, and documents and highlights results; take the lead in program evaluation, monitoring and reporting; advocate and support continued research in the field of prevention through coordination with the GOB; participate on the National Prevention Technical Working Group and ensure that USAID activities are coordinated and integrated with national campaigns; represent USAID and present at international conferences, when appropriate; collaborate with other PEPFAR Technical Advisors to provide comprehensive guidance to IPs on the HIV/AIDS care and prevention services; and ensure the incorporation of prevention activities across program areas (Palliative Care, HIV Testing and Counseling, Gender, Male Circumcision, Capacity Building).<br />

<p><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</strong> - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</strong> - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this synopsis/solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <br />1. Past Performance: In accordance with FAR 52.212-1(b)(10) and the following, the offeror is required to identify past or current contracts for efforts similar to this requirement. Offerors shall provide the information shown below for at least three (3) and no more than five (5) contracts for the same or similar items. Provide as a minimum the following applicable information for each contract:</p>
<p>a. Contract number, Names of contracting parties or agency, point of contact, specifically the Contracting Officer and the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR), including email address and telephone number of these identified individuals.<br />b. Ship name, hull type, length, and displacement.<br />c. Type of availability (dry dock, dockside, etc.) and where performed;<br />d. Original contract commencement and completion dates, actual commencement and completion dates, and explanation of (i.e. reasons for) schedule slippage/extensions, if any;<br />e. Award price and final contract price (award plus growth), including the total number of growth work changes and scope of these changes. <br /><br />Past Performance will look at relevant experience, responsiveness, resources, quality and consistency of services, customer satisfaction, and management.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Price: The total price will be the evaluated price.<br /><br />(a) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br />EVALUATION APPROACH</p>
<p>1. An evaluation plan has been established to evaluate the factors set forth below and all proposals shall be subject to evaluation by a team of Government personnel in accordance with the plan.</p>
<p>2. The Government will evaluate each proposal strictly in accordance with its content and will not assume that performance will include areas not specified in the offeror's written proposal. The Government reserves the right to contact other government and commercial sources to validate information submitted in a proposal and to assess capability, past performance and responsibility.</p>
<p>3. Proposals, which are unrealistic in terms of price, will be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence or indicative of a failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the proposed contract. Such proposals may be rejected as unacceptable without further discussions. In addition, the Government reserves the right to eliminate from consideration those proposals as deficient in information as to require a major re-write or revision in order to become acceptable.</p>
<p>4. The technical evaluation factors and other factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award.</p>
<p>5. The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal Revisions. The contract will be awarded as a firm fixed price contract using simplified acquisition procedures.</p>
<p>The Government will award a contract resulting from this synopsis/solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be more advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. For the purpose of this solicitation technical capability and past performance are approximately equal to price.</p>
<p>Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit proposals that will be considered by the agency. Proposals must fully address all Technical Capabilities Factors and Past Performance. No reference to Price shall be included in the Proposal. Proposals must contain the contractor's Tax Information Number, and DUNS Number. Proposals must be received not later than <br />24 JAN 2011, 11:00 A.M. Local California time. Proposals received after the date and time specified will not be considered. Proposals may be submitted as an attachment to an e-mail addressed to: Brenda.l.lentz@uscg.mil .</p>

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>To fulfill its mandate to effectively respond to disasters worldwide, OFDA has established six permanent regional offices in the following locations: Budapest, Hungary; San Jose, Costa Rica; Nairobi, Kenya; Dakar, Senegal; Pretoria, South Africa; and Bangkok, Thailand. The sub regional offices are in Almaty, Kazakhstan and the Cairo, Egypt.</p>
<p>The regional offices are headed by Senior Regional Advisors (SRAs) who report to the Disaster Response Team Leader in Washington. SRAs serve as the regional team leader for all response, preparedness and disaster risk reduction activities. They primarily serve as the key interlocutor with embassies and missions in the event of a disaster but may also serve as the Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) leader if needed. They are principally responsible for managing the regional offices, monitoring all grants on humanitarian assistance program implementation, overseeing the sub-regional offices, as appropriate, supervising the office staff, and developing, in consultation with their respective Washington-based Regional Coordinators , the multi-year non-response program strategies for the their respective regions. The SRAs coordinate with OFDA/Washington on disaster response activities, determine program priorities, and identify and formulate disaster preparedness, mitigation and training programs for their respective regions. The Regional Advisors (RAs) reporting to the SRAs ensure that OFDA's objectives for disaster response and assistance, strategic reporting and analysis are met. The RAs are responsible for monitoring and reporting on OFDA-funded programs and activities, and formulating disaster response, preparedness, mitigation and training programs for the region.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA requires the services of a Regional Advisor (RA) in San Jose, Costa Rica.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>This Regional Advisor position requires an individual who is able to travel outside of the country where they are based, on short notice for two to three weeks at a time, or longer, on occasion. The incumbent will serve as the primary contact and liaison for on-going disaster activities related to disaster response, preparedness, mitigation and training programs. The incumbent will work to increase the capability of host governments, international organizations (IOs), and non governmental organizations (NGOs) to respond and prepare for disasters in the affected region. The Regional Advisor will be responsible for disaster analysis, program monitoring, overseeing NGO partner implementation, reporting to OFDA Washington, and liaising with USAID Missions and U.S. Embassies.</p>
<p>A) Disaster Response - Working directly under the guidance and supervision of the respective Senior Regional Advisor, the incumbent will:</p>
<p>&bull; Travel to the scene of a disaster or potential disaster and assist in initial assessments of damages and needs; determine appropriate relief assistance and emergency interventions, in consultation with OFDA/Washington and/or the Principal Regional Advisor; and provide timely reporting cables and other written analysis of these events;<br />&bull; Coordinate and liaise with representatives of host governments, donor governments, IOs, NGOs, U.S. Embassies, and USAID Missions to facilitate cooperation and coordination in disaster response activities;<br />&bull; Monitor DCHA/OFDA-funded activities and report in accordance with OFDA guidelines, policies, and requirements;<br />&bull; Become certified and serve as an Agreement Officer's Technical Representative (AOTR) and Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) for grants, cooperative agreements and contracts;<br />&bull; Serve as required as DART Team Leader or as a DART team member during a disaster response;<br />&bull; Maintain regular communications with the regional (and/or sub-regional) office in their area of responsibility and with OFDA/Washington;<br />&bull; Prepare specific requested field information and subject reports, as required by OFDA/Washington.<br /><br />B) Disaster Preparedness - Working closely with OFDA/Washington and drawing on the skills and technical expertise within the office and available through inter- and intra-agency agreements, the incumbent will assist representatives of host government organizations, IOs, and NGOs in the development of strong emergency and disaster preparedness/mitigation programs.</p>
<p>Specifically, the incumbent, in collaboration with OFDA regional/sub-regional team colleagues, will:</p>
<p>&bull; Assist with the design, development, and implementation of strategies and integrated disaster assistance and response for OFDA, local governments, and other donors/organizations as appropriate;<br />&bull; Advise regional officials, including host country authorities and other USAID and/or U.S. Embassy officials on OFDA's efforts in disaster response and management;<br />&bull; Provide support for other OFDA initiatives in the assigned region as identified by the incumbent's respective Regional Office and/or sub-regional team. Support may include but is not limited to assessment/evaluation visits, project design exercises and hazards/vulnerability/risk analysis;<br />&bull; Coordinate with other agencies/organizations to identify critical disaster concerns affecting the region and countries and develop projects/activities for addressing these;<br />&bull; Work with representatives of local and regional institutions and private/public sector organizations to incorporate preparedness and mitigation into appropriate programs;<br />&bull; Prepare regular strategic and analytical reports on current or anticipated emergencies, as well as comprehensive preparedness documentation on assigned countries.</p>

<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />Supervisory controls will be minimal. The Senior Regional Advisor will provide direction in terms of broadly defined program goals and objectives.

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

Page 5 of the SOW states a 3-year warranty requested and Section C.2.8 states a 1-year warranty requested. Which is correct? EVG would prefer to quote a 1-year warranty or Year 2 and Year 3 could be quoted in the Options(1A)-- The clause on page 5 of the SOW is: "- includes a 3-year warranty that includes yearly upgrades to the current version of the software. " This refers to the software only - i.e. we expect access to all system software upgrades for a period of three (3) years from installation. Section C.2.8 states a 1-year warranty, which refers to the hardware. I hope that clarifies the request adequately.(2Q)-- Suss MicroTec requests clarification of what is required in response to Line Item #2, page 16, "Contractor Manpower Reporting - Cost for providing accounting for contract services". (2A)-- As part of its proposal, the offeror shall provide the estimated total cost (if any) expected to be incurred in order to comply with the Contractor Manpower Reporting Application (CMRA) requirement. Offeror will determine, in Section B, CLIN(s) 0002, either to price or not-separately-price the CMRA requirement. CLIN(s) 0002 is/are the CLIN(s) under which the contractor shall bill for all costs associated with the CMRA requirement.(3Q)--In the SOW, what it the intent of the wording "The Contractor shall ensure that the cleanliness in the cleanroom is class 100 or International Standards Organization (ISO) class five (5) compatible."?(3A)--Should read "The Contractor shall ensure that the cleanliness of the Cluster Tool (in operation) is class 100 or International Standards Organization(ISO) class five (5) cleanroom compatible"(4Q)--On Page 5 of the SOW it states that a 200C HMDS Vapor Prime hot plate is required. The EVG standard Vapor Prime hot plate has a maximum temperature of 150C. Is 150C OK or is there some specific reason for the 200C requirement?(4A)--150 degC is acceptable.<BR><BR>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

____________________________________________________________________________________

ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:

HEALTH & WELFARE: $3.50 per hour or $140.00 per week or $606.67 per month

VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or
successor; 3 weeks after 8 years, and 4 weeks after 20 years.  Length of service
includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or
successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the
performance of similar work at the same Federal facility.  (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)

HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year:  New Year's Day, Martin Luther
King Jr.'s Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day,
Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.  (A
contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in
accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.)  (See 29 CFR 4.174)



THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:

1)  COMPUTER EMPLOYEES:  Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does
not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,
administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541.  Because
most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate
not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per
week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.
400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations
within those job families.  In addition, because this wage determination may not
list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey
data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds
$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees.  For
example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties
within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer
occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,
then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the
conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage
determination.

Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer
industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer
professional exemption.  Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees
who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:
    (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including
consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional
specifications;
    (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or
modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and
related to user or system design specifications;
    (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer
programs related to machine operating systems; or
    (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which
requires the same level of skills.  (29 C.F.R. 541.400).

2)  AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY:  If you
work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential
and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.
 If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your
regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday
premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime
(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered
overtime work).


HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees
employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or
in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials.  This
includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive
ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder
and photoflash powder.  All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.
  Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations
on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials.  All operations
involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.

A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that
represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to
ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials
which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the
employee engaged in the operation,  irritation of the skin, minor burns and the
like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.
All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and
incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition.  These differentials
are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for
ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.

** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **

If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract
(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or
local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by
laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an
employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage
determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the
following standards as compliance:

The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an
adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual
cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made
the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to
this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining
agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary
affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning
and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in
those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"
materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do
not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial
laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms
of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,
there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.

The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the
"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,
unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A
links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.
gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at
http://wdol.gov/.

REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form
1444 (SF 1444)}

Conformance Process:

The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is
not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to
be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage
determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable
relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted
classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Such
conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the
fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by
the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)
of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall
be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}
When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444
should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be
conformed.

The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:

1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed
occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).

2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order
proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each
proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage
rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the
authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized
representative, the employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the
contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees
performs any contract work.

3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report
of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent
information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage
and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,
for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).

4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or
disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or
notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process
the request.

5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.

6) The contractor informs the affected employees.

Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.

When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of
Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure
that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the
wage determination.  Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that
determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.
Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide
classifications listed in the wage determination.

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Changes</span>: Answers to questions have been posted in the attachement "Answers to Solicitation Quetions - HU0001-11-T-V405." The deadline for submissions has been extended to noon on January 28th.</strong> <strong>All other details remain the same.</strong><br /><br />The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS) located on the Naval Support Activity Bethesda (NSA Bethesda) - formerly known as the National Naval Medical Center (NNMC) - in Bethesda, Maryland, has a requirement for a comprehensive five-year assessment of the Vice President for Finance and Administration. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This request for quotes (RFQ) for commercial services is in accordance with FAR Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  It will be the responsibility of the offeror to check the website, http://www.fbo.gov, for the issuance of any amendments to the solicitation. This RFQ incorporates all provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-47.
<p>This requirement is set aside for small businesses under NAICS code 541612. See attached provisions and clauses. The Government will award a single award, firm fixed price contract. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">To be eligible for contract award, an offeror must register with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database and the Online Representations and Certifications Applicatio n (ORCA)</span>.</strong> For instructions on registering with CCR, please see CCR's website at https://www.bpn.gov/ccr/default.aspx.</p>
<p><strong>Requirement &amp; Background: </strong><br />The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS) has a requirement for a comprehensive assessment of the performance of the Vice President for Finance and Administration of the University (VP for Finance and Administration) over the past five years.  USUHS wishes to employ the services of a nationally recognized professional with experience and expertise in finance, budgeting, planning and administration for an academic health center/medical school administration.</p>
<p>The University President established the requirement that each of the University's senior leadership would undergo a comprehensive performance assessment at the completion of their fifth year of service to the University. A comprehensive assessment for the VP for Finance and Administration has not been accomplished to date - only annual self-assessments. The requirement calls for a qualified outside contractor to lead a team of selected members from USUHS in completing  interviews and a comprehensive review of the VP of Finance and Administration's performance against the goals he established and were subsequently approved by the University President. The outside contractor will then provide the final assessment in written and presentation form to the University President.</p>
<p><strong>University Information:</strong><br />Established by U.S. Congress in 1972 under the Department of Defense, this federally funded university educates and trains uniformed services scientists and healthcare practitioners for the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, U.S. Public Health Service and the Veterans Administration. The University's F.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to address the following contractor's questions.&nbsp; Please see the attached file.<br /><br />The purpose of this amendment is to address the following contractor's questions:
<p>1. Just to confirm, the work required is the sequencing and delivery of the data only. The IP work would be done elsewhere, as well as the RNA extraction from tissues. Is this correct? Can you provide additional information about these requirements.</p>
<p>Yes, USUHS will perform all IP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) assays and RNA extraction from tissues. The contractor is expected to perform quality check of the samples, all steps of sequencing, initial data analysis including the alignment with the reference genome and final delivery of the data.</p>
<p>2. Upon completion of the processing of each sample batch, as provided by the USUHS, the Contractor shall provide a briefing or report synopsis to the designated USUHS point of contact along with the results of each sample batch. Can you provide additional information on the format and detail required for these reports?</p>
<p>Upon completion of the processing of each sample batch, the contractor is expected to provide the QC (quality check) data [e.g. files generated showing the quality (RIN values for RNA), quantity of the samples as well as base pair size distribution of fragments especially for the CHIP samples]. Apart from these, the contractor is expected to provide the raw sequence files, quality reports, as well as data files generated after alignment with the reference genome.</p>
<p>3. The Contractor shall also provide all necessary research support to ensure the successful completion of the project. Can you provide additional information about the extent of the contractor's responsibility? Presumably, it would be limited to the<br />provision of high-quality data.</p>
<p>The contractor is expected to help us generate the best high quality data. This will include providing scientific suggestions and support to facilitate the sample preparation of best quality as well the final data analysis comprising quality assessment of the sequence data, normalization, gene expression analysis, novel miRNA exploration, defining peaks and final ratiometric comparison of experimental to control samples to identify true binding sites. <br />4. There are three applications in this project, which are ChIP-Seq, MeDIP-Seq and RNA-seq. For each application, do your PIs have any specific requirement for sequencing design, such as sequence read length, single read or paired end read.<br />We would like to run our samples using Illumina sequencers and single read fragment libraries using the latest development in sample indexing. The read depth can be adjusted based upon contractors experience and our preliminary results. We need flexibility/high-sequencing capacity of the contractor so that the project can be finished in a timely manner.</p>
<p>5. In the request, you specifically mentioned pooling samples. For pooling samples, sample numbers in each pool will vary based on application type and data throughput requirement. Do you have any requirement on sample pooling strategy? Or we should based on your preliminary study to design sample pooling.</p>
<p>Yes, we understand that the sample numbers in each pool will vary based on application type and data throughput requirement. We would be interested in pooling the number of samples recommended by the contractor based on contractor prior published experience and knowledge and also based on our preliminary study data to finally achieve high quality sequencing data with adequate read depth.</p>
<p>6. For methylation seq, is this is whole genome scale? Or just portion of genome.</p>
<p>For methylation seq, we are interested to perform whole genome MeDIP sequencing.<br />7. Beyond aligning the sequence data to the reference genome how much analysis is required, if any? Is differential expression analysis between sample sets part of this project or will it be handled internally? What specific types of analysis are you looking and how will that data be summarized and managed?<br />After the alignment with the reference genome, we will perform multiple set of data analysis related to different applications mentioned in the proposed contract. This will be handled internally (but require scientific support and suggestions from the contractor) and mainly include:</p>
<p>a) differential expression analysis between treated and untreated samples for RNASeq <br />b) peak finding, % input and final calculation of differential fold occupancy of the protein of interest between treated and untreated samples for ChIPSeq<br />c) estimate the methylation levels of different regions throughout the genome between treated and untreated samples</p>
<p>All data relevant to the project will be stored on a Dell T7500 work station and external UNIX servers. Secondary analysis will be performed using specialized statistical and bioinformatic analysis tools suggested by the contractor based on contractor prior experience in data analysis.</p>
<p>8. What is the expected deliverable with respect to data format, type, summary reports etc.<br />The expected deliverable is the raw sequencing reads in a FASTA format and the associated sequence quality files in .fastq or a suitable format. Alignment of reads with the reference genome in SAM format will be expected. <br />Apart from this, we require the basic QC files to check the quality of the samples submitted for sequencing. The data format is liable to change based on our discussion, prior experience, and knowledge of the contractor.<br /><br /><br />All quotes are still due on&nbsp;January 25, 2011 at 12:00 pm (est).&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />U. S. COAST GUARD<br />HU-25 ENGINE AND AUXILIARY POWER UNIT ELECTRONIC CONTROL REPAIR<br />STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES (SOO)</p>
<p>1.0 INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The purpose of this Statement Of Objectives (SOO) is to define the tasks to be performed for the repair of HU-25 Engine and Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) Electronic Controls installed in the United States Coast Guard (USCG) Fleet of HU-25 Aircraft. This SOO outlines the tasks and services that will be performed for the USCG by the contractor under this program.</p>
<p>2.0 OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this program is for the proposed contractor to provide all resources required to accomplish the test, repair and modification of the items identified in this SOO within a required delivery turn time Not To Exceed (NTE) 180 days. This includes repair labor, test labor, materials, and other direct/indirect costs.</p>
<p><br />3.0 SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>The contractor shall perform the scope of work identified below on repairable items returned to them exhibiting normal wear and tear that is common to the operating environment and usage of the item.</p>
<p>a) Test Only (No Fault Found) - The component shall be tested prior to repair, utilizing the <br />Acceptance Test Procedure developed for the component by the contractor. If the incoming component passes the acceptance test, it shall be returned to the USCG under the "No Fault Found" Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) of the contract schedule.</p>
<p>b) Repair - Shall consist of troubleshooting, repair, or <br />replacement of circuit card(s), or individual circuit card components such as capacitors, transistors, micro chips, etc. Minor repair of chassis wiring harnesses will also be covered under repair. The Acceptance Test Procedure shall be accomplished to verify proper function of the component following repair.</p>
<p>c) Modification - Any change in the physical form, fit, or functional characteristic of the <br />component or system.</p>
<p>d) Partial Refresh- The contractor agrees to submit a Firm-Fixed Price proposal (FFP) along with supporting information to the USCG Contracting Officer for any item that is a candidate for a "Partial Refresh". The price for this will become a line item of the contract repair schedule. The primary purpose of a "Partial Refresh" is to improve the reliability and repair turn around. If the cost proposal for the partial refresh is acceptable the USCG Contracting Officer may elect to modify this contract. "Partial Refresh" shall be a one-time, major repair to (EEC) PN 2101484-14, and shall be documented by signing off the ACMS code assigned to this task for the serial number EEC affected. Under no circumstances will an EEC be partially refreshed twice without written instructions from the USCG Contracting Officer. The Partial Refresh will consist of replacing Circuit Card Assemblies (CCA) A1, A2, A3, A5, A7, and A13, with new manufacture CCA's. The USCG intends to have 50 each EEC P/N 2101484-14 "partially refreshed" and desires that all 50 be completed within the first 3 years of the contract.<br /><br />4.0 REPAIR CONTROL</p>
<p>The contractor shall be responsible for establishing an internal monitoring system to ensure repairable items are tracked and repaired in a timely manner.</p>
<p>The contractor has a required delivery of 180 calendar days for turn-around-time (TAT). The TAT clock begins after receipt of the repairable item at the contractor's repair facility dock and receipt of the corresponding Delivery Order (DO) by the contractor facility/Point of Contact, the latter of which will start the TAT clock. The contractor is to notify the USCG Contracting Officer immediately upon delivery at their repair facility.</p>
<p>The TAT clock will stop should the following situations arise:</p>
<p>a. Item exceeds "Order Limitations for Maximum Order" as per FAR clause 52.216-19. <br />b. Receipt of items missing subassemblies.<br />c. Items deemed Beyond Economical Repair (BER) or Beyond Physical Repair (BPR) as agreed by both parties.<br />d. Request for Engineering Analysis. (This needs to be discussed/clarified on a one to one basis)<br />e. Awaiting price approval for work to be performed outside the scope as agreed upon by both parties in the final awarded contract.<br />f. Notification by the Contracting Officer to cease work until authorized to continue.<br />g. Awaiting approval for Class I Changes (Class 1 changes are blueprint design changes that affect fit, form, or function.)<br />h. Unusual damage induced by the USCG.<br />i. Foreign Object Damage (FOD).<br />j. Obsolescence Issues. <br />k. Missing corresponding DO authorizing repair.</p>
<p>Should any of these situations occur, the contractor shall immediately advise the USCG Contracting Officer via facsimile (FAX) or E-mail.</p>
<p>Upon resolution of these situations, the TAT clock will commence and the contractor will immediately begin performance of work.</p>
<p>i) The contractor shall promptly notify the USCG Contracting Officer of any condition that could have potential or actual negative impact on the contractor's performance under this multi-year repair program; including, but not limited to: closing or moving of facilities; loss of key personnel; work stoppages/strikes; capacity issues as the result of other customers; and material supply issues.</p>
<p>Storage - Items shall be handled and stored in accordance with "Best Commercial Practices" without any increase in price and in such a manner to prevent damage and/or theft. All material purchased by the USCG for use as Government Furnished Property (GFP) shall be placed in a bonded storage, segregated from other bonded storage material, jointly inventoried by the vendor and a USCG representative at least once each calendar year. All GFP not in inventory must be traceable to use or installation in the USCG end item.</p>
<p>4.1 Items Received in an Abnormal Condition:</p>
<p>a) Should an incoming shipment bear evidence of shipping damage, the contractor shall immediately notify the USCG Contracting Officer via e-mail or fax and await disposition instructions from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>b) If an item is received at the contractor's repair facility in an incomplete condition, a Report of Discrepancy (ROD) in the contractor's format will be filled out and forwarded to the USCG Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>c) If an item is received at the contractor's facility, which is recommended by the contractor to be in a Beyond Economical Repair (BER) or Beyond Physical Repair (BPR) condition as defined below, the USCG Contracting Officer must be notified in writing immediately after the BER/BPR condition is identified. The contractor shall provide a cost breakdown to repair the item, so a fair and reasonable determination can be made by the USCG.</p>
<p>1) Beyond Economical Repair (BER) - An individual repair that will cost more than 75% of a new replacement unit. An item can only be deemed BER through a bilateral agreement between the contractor and the USCG.</p>
<p>2) Beyond Physical Repair (BPR) - An item received for repair that is considered non-reparable. An item can only be deemed BPR through a bilateral agreement between the contractor and the USCG.</p>
<p>d) In the above conditions, no further repair action will be taken and the unit in question is to be put in the bonded storeroom for safe keeping until written authorization to proceed or disposition instructions are received from the USCG Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Upon resolution of these situations, the TAT clock will commence and the contractor will immediately begin performance of work.</p>
<p>The TAT clock ends when the item is delivered to USCG Aviation Logistics Center (ALC).</p>
<p>The contractor is granted Material Review Board (MRB) authority for this repair program. <br />The contractor is authorized to incorporate Class II changes without authority from the USCG. (Class II changes are minor changes that do not affect fit, form or function.)</p>
<p>4.2 Actions Following Repair</p>
<p>a) Test After Repair - The contractor shall use the Repair Acceptance Test Procedure that was developed to test the item to assure serviceability of the repaired item. The contractor's inspector will witness the test and shall certify the acceptance of the repaired item by entering his or her name and/or stamp and date in appropriate blocks of the repair action document. The contractor shall issue a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 8130-3 Flight Worthiness Document for each repair of Electronic Engine Control (EEC) part number (PN) 2101484-14. The EEC is a flight critical item and is tracked utilizing the USCG Aviation Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS). All other engine electronic components on this contract are non flight critical, not ACMS tracked, and may have repairs documented by a Certificate Of Conformance (COC) acceptable to the Government.</p>
<p>b) Identification and Condition Code Tags - Ready-For-Issue (RFI) or Not Ready-For-Issue (NRFI) tags will be completed and attached to the repair item. The same data will be shown on the accompanying packing list. The tag will reflect the P/N of the item after repair and conformance to repair requirements certified by the contractor's quality inspector.</p>
<p>c) Inspection Test Records - The contractor shall keep and maintain proper and adequate inspection, test and related records, including Certificate of Conformance (COC) and repair action document. The Test/Acceptance report for any item repaired under this contract shall be made available to the USCG upon written request from the USCG Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>4.3 Obsolescence Management</p>
<p>USCG acknowledges that some items on this contract may be at risk for obsolescence. The contractor has entered into this contract subject to commercial availability of component parts in the market at reasonable prices to complete orders under this contract.</p>
<p>a) If, during the manufacture or repair process, the contractor becomes aware that required component parts are no longer available, the contractor is authorized to immediately stop work and notify the USCG Contracting Officer of the obsolescence factors.</p>
<p>b) If the USCG determines that the item is still required and so notifies the contractor, they will investigate alternate sources within the industry for compatible replacement parts that meet the contractor's Quality System Requirements and do not modify form, fit, or function of the end item.</p>
<p>c) In some cases, out of manufacture parts may be available on the market from distributors or surplus dealers who have made life time buys at the time of last manufacture. In such cases, distributors and dealers, to account for the risk of holding out of manufacture parts, often escalate prices substantially. The USCG Contracting Officer agrees price impacts due to obsolescence shall be a basis for equitable adjustment of contract price and that the contractor will promptly submit a proposal with supporting information for required contract changes.</p>
<p>d) If a suitable replacement component is not found within a time period mutually agreed upon by the USCG and the contractor, the USCG Contracting Officer agrees to terminate for convenience without penalty that portion of the contract affected by obsolescence.</p>
<p>e) As an alternative to termination for convenience, the contractor will, at the USCG Contracting Officer's request, submit a quotation to perform an obsolescence review of the subject product. Upon approval or agreement of the obsolescence review, the contractor, if directed by the USCG Contracting Officer, shall provide a proposal for the effort required for updating the production in order to fulfill the contract.</p>
<p>f) Upon receipt of a Notice of Obsolescence from the contractor on an item, the USCG Contracting Officer will suspend the delivery date, without penalty, and re-establish a new delivery date by mutual agreement, upon resolution of the obsolescence problem.</p>
<p>5.0 Service Bulletins-</p>
<p>All new service bulletins shall be identified by the contractor to the USCG Contracting Officer. Upon receipt of notification from the Contracting Officer that a service bulletin is required, the contractor will submit an FFP to incorporate the Service Bulletin in all subsequent repairs to the P/N component. This FFP shall be submitted by the contractor to the USCG Contracting Officer within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the notification. The proposal will contain supporting pricing information. Upon agreement of an FFP, the USCG Contracting Officer will issue a contract modification to incorporate the service bulletin. Service bulletins created and incorporated during performance of this requirement may create new part number configurations, which supersede the previous configuration. When service bulletin incorporation changes the Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) part number, the new part number shall be added to the contract. The same procedures apply if removal of service bulletins is required.</p>

<p>52.212-2 - Evaluation - Commercial Items. (JAN 1999)</p>
<p>DETAILED FACTORS</p>
<p>Factor 1: Technical Management/Solution/Approach</p>
<p>The technical/management solution/approach will be evaluated for its quality and evidence of extent to which Contractor's solutions will achieve Coast Guard objectives of Engine and auxiliary power unit (APU) electronic controls refurbishment (repair). The evaluation will include an assessment that the solution adheres to sound engineering, design and management practices and that the Contractor has a complete understanding of the objectives, constraints and is customer focused. Evidence of the quality of the technical management /solution/approach includes:</p>
<p>(a) A comprehensive performance work statement and contract breakdown structure that identifies the services to be implemented to meet the program and mission requirements set forth in the statement of objectives.</p>
<p>(b) A sound technical proposal that clearly demonstrates how implementation of the proposed solutions will deliver timely, stable, reliable, secure, flexible, responsive, compliant and cost effective services.</p>
<p>(c) A sound partnering approach to management that demonstrates the ability to aggressively identify and apply information technology solutions to business processes. The management approach needs to provide:</p>
<p>&bull; Highly qualified and experienced key personnel with a proven track record of success in providing large enterprise-wide managed services under performance based arrangements.<br />&bull; Clear lines of communication between the Contractor's team and the Coast Guard for timely problem identification, mitigation and resolution.<br />&bull; Active and continuing participation and involvement of senior corporate executives in ensuring the success of this program.</p>
<p>(d) The Contractor's validated process and procedures that ensure high quality performance. i.e., ISO 9000 type or other quality certifications, original equipment manufacturer (OEM) required service bulletins, FAA 8130-3 Flight Worthiness Document or COC.</p>
<p>Factor 2: Performance Measures and Metrics</p>
<p>The offered performance metrics and service level agreements will be evaluated for the extent they are:</p>
<p>(a) Comprehensive in their ability to quantify, measure, track and report operational performance relating to both system and management performance as well as achievement of Coast Guard objectives.<br />(b) Identifying the highest level of service consistent with cost effectiveness<br />(c) Tied to performance incentives and disincentives that are directly related to meeting or exceeding mission critical performance metrics.</p>
<p>Factor 3: Past Performance</p>
<p>The past performance evaluation will examine how the Contractor's past and present performance validates expected performance and customer satisfaction. The Coast Guard may use data obtained from other sources to conduct the past performance assessment, as well as that provided in the quotation.</p>
<p>The past performance evaluation will also examine the Contractor's actual performance on repair of similar or like items. This review will focus on the scope and complexity of the efforts, the performance measures/service levels applied, and the actual results achieved against those measures.</p>
<p>Factor 4: Cost/Price</p>
<p>Each Contractor's cost/price proposal will be evaluated based on the following:</p>
<p>(a) Evaluation of proposed price/cost.</p>
<p>(b) Reasonableness: Reasonableness will be established by the existence of adequate price competition and by comparing all, or a representative sample of the proposed prices/costs to industry average rates and/or rates from other contracts for similar work, etc.</p>
<p>(c) Realism: If applicable, a realism assessment will be accomplished by technical review and evaluation of the skill mix, specific hours, material kinds and quantity for reach identified CLIN/SubCLIN in the contractor's proposed cost/price proposal. The intent of the evaluation is to determine whether the estimated proposed price/cost elements are realistic for the work to be performed; reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and are consistent with the approach described in the Contractor's technical proposal.</p>

<DESC>The Military Satellite Communications Systems Directorate (MILSATCOM) will hold an Industry Day on 2 February 2011 beginning at 8:30 AM PST for parties interested in participating in the solicitation for the MILSATCOM System Engineering and Integration (SE&amp;I) contract; both small and large business participation is highly encouraged. For this acquisition, the anticipated NAICS code is 541330, Engineering Services with a size standard of $27M. The Industry Day will be held at the Space &amp; Missile Systems Center, Los Angeles Air Force Base, Gordon Conference Center, Bldg 270, 483 N. Aviation Blvd, El Segundo, CA 90245. Also, one-on-one discussions will be held with potential interested prime contractors. This announcement is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government.
<p>MILSATCOM is conducting acquisition planning for enterprise-wide Systems Engineering and Integration support for all MILSATCOM programs. Current programs include: Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF), Milstar, Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS), Enhanced Polar System (EPS), Wideband Global Satellite Communications (WGS), Operations Support, Advanced Concept Group (ACG), the Global Broadcast System (GBS), the FAB-T terminal family, Joint Terminal Engineering, and Command and Control System - Consolidated (CCS-C). These programs, their related support facilities and those to come in the future will be referred to as the MILSATCOM enterprise.<br /><br />The envisioned effort will provide systems engineering for programs across the MILSATCOM enterprise, including ongoing efforts in the area of development, test, computer simulation/verification, performance analysis, operations analysis, information assurance, interface documentation and control, configuration management, and risk management. The provider shall serve as systems integrator for all programs within the MILSATCOM enterprise, responsible for integration and analysis of all aspects, including resolution of technical and schedule issues involving program contractors and stakeholders.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Industry Day meeting is to exchange preliminary information with industry and to solicit input on the Government's performance work statement document as part of the Government's market research and acquisition planning activities. The program does not have an approved acquisition strategy and none should be assumed based on the draft documents to be provided for industry review and comment. A sources sought synopsis will be published prior to Industry Day as a means of conducting market research.</p>
<p>Interested parties are invited to submit recommended discussion questions by 1200 PST on 28 Jan 11. All input shall be submitted via email to SMC/PKJ, Tracy Stroud, Contracting Officer (tracy.stroud@losangeles.af.mil) and the technical point of contact, Shawn Caldwell (shawn.caldwell@losangeles.af.mil) Discussion questions must be marked appropriately; justification must be provided for any portion marked as proprietary or with other restrictions on their use.</p>
<p>All interested parties are invited to attend the Government's presentation on the program and enterprise overview. One-on-one sessions will be made by appointment and last no more than 45 minutes. Seating is limited for the side sessions, so contractor teams must limit personnel to 10 for these sessions. All attending personnel must provide their full name and social security number to Maj Michael Russell (michael.russell@losangeles.af.mil) NLT&nbsp;5:00&nbsp;PM PST&nbsp;on 28 Jan 2011 in order to ensure base access can be granted. All meetings will be held at the unclassified level. Each organization should also indicate the number of vehicles they are bringing as parking is limited.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment is to change the response date for the Sources Sought Notice W31P4Q-11-R-0066. Therefore, the correct response date/time for the information requested is due on 1700 hours (CST), 7 February 2011. Except as stated above, all other terms and conditions of this notice remain unchanged.<BR><BR><BR>Notice:<BR><BR>It is recognized that industry and other United States Government (USG) agencies could possess information relevant to development of the Indirect Fire Protection Capability, Increment 2, Intercept (IFPC Inc2-I) system concept and/or critical technologies that are not currently available to the Cruise Missile Defense System (CMDS) Project Office.  For this reason, and in order to create an open environment for future competitions that may be associated with any IFPC Inc2-I Program, the CMDS Project Office is providing this Request for Information (RFI). The primary purpose of the IFPC Inc2-I program is to enhance counter measures for rockets, artillery and mortar (RAM) threats.  Contact POC: All questions or requests regarding this notice may be addressed to Oksana Joye, Contract Specialist, via e-mail oksana.joye@us.army.mil or sent: ATTN: Oksana Joye, Department of the Army, US Army Contracting Command, AMCOM Contracting Cent, CCAM-SM-T, Building 5303, Martin Road, Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898. No telephone requests will be accepted.<BR><BR>This is a pre-solicitation RFI issued pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.2.  The CMDS Project Office is conducting a market survey of concepts that can provide enhanced protection for fixed and semi-fixed positions against RAM threats.  No award is intended as a result of this request.  The USG will not pay for information received.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the USG to form a binding contract.  The CMDS Project Office is interested in receiving suggestive information on IFPC Inc2-I concepts that can be quickly implemented and fielded at a reasonable cost that use open architecture constructs to enable integration with existing force and future Command and Control (C2) capabilities.   Either a total system concept or information on key components is being sought.  Within this RFI, a firing system is envisioned to include all the components necessary to execute the engagement of a RAM threat given receipt of an external C2 cue and authority to engage.  <BR><BR>The Accelerated IFPC Inc2-I System Requirements:  Concepts proposed are expected to contain the attributes described below.  All materiel solutions will be considered except conventional gun/armament based solutions since the USG has already completed exhaustive reviews of these concepts.   Utilization of existing capabilities and/or modifications of current fielded army or DoD systems to meet the IFPC Inc2-I requirements is strongly encouraged.  Regardless of concept, the key system attributes for IFPC Inc2-I are: responsiveness to threat systems and the ability to defeat the threat systems.  The threat timeline forces a response time of about 13 seconds, which includes the time from external sensor detection to interceptor engagement (mission kill).  The IFPC Inc2-I system will be able to receive a cue from sensors currently deployed with Brigade Combat Teams and have the ability to seamlessly integrate into an Air and Missile Defense (AMD) C2 architecture when required.  USG analysis of lethality/kinetic energy requirements to defeat likely threat systems is available to respondents upon request within the limitations of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and Arms Export Control Act restrictions.  Prior to identifying how each component is broken down, a discussion on the system's overall operational concept should be provided.  The operational concept should begin with the fire control given a radar track/sensor cue, direction to engage and follow the required sequence of events for a mission kill.  The ability to provide additional insights that describe the maturity and demonstrated performance of each component are desired as this will be helpful to better understand the likelihood of availability the proposed concepts for relatively near term use.  Potential candidate materiel solutions include, but should not be limited to:<BR><BR>Missile Interceptor Concepts:  These concepts should address the specifics of each component: launcher, interceptor, fire control sensor and control system.  Specifics on each component are identified in the component attributes below.  In describing the concept, details on specific maturity of each component and any technological aspects which require maturing should be highlighted.  USG missile interceptor design information is available to respondents upon request within limitations of the ITAR and Arms Export Control Act restrictions.  Of particular interest is any concept that is able to effectively utilize existing Army/DoD sensors such as the Sentinel radar to control the interceptor accurately enough to defeat the incoming threat.<BR><BR>Directed Energy Concepts:  Directed energy concepts may include lasers, particle beam, microwave, millimeter wave, radio frequency, acoustic and electromagnetic launch concepts.  These concepts should address the specifics of each component: fire unit, control system, thermal control subsystem and power subsystem.  In addition, the proposed tactical packaging of each system and intended effects should be described in detail.  Definition of the specific technical maturity and/or prior use of each component should be included.  Respondents are requested to include the predicted environment and weather related limitations for any directed energy concepts.<BR><BR>Other Innovative Concepts:  Should there be non-missile/directed energy or an integrated directed energy/missile solution proposed, a complete description of the system concept along with the technical maturity of the individual system components should be provided.  Specifics on how this concept would be demonstrated and effects validated shall be included.<BR><BR>Performance requirements:  The preliminary key objectives for the IFPC Inc2-I performance envelope are described below.  To some extent, performance can be traded for significant cost and schedule advantages.<BR> 	Probability to detonate/deflagrate RAM threats of with a confidence level greater than 90% (single shot is preferred).<BR> 	An IFPC Inc2-I system shall be able to protect a defended area of 16km2 against all RAM threats:<BR> 	Demonstrate the ability to be supported by existing operational battle management architectures;<BR> 	A firing system shall be able to engage 3-8 simultaneous threats arriving from different threat axis;<BR> 	Firing systems, either individually or coupled, shall provide 3600 coverage of inbound threats;<BR> 	The firing system shall be able to engage a minimum of 30 threats without requiring a reload;<BR> 	Minimize collateral damage; the likely minimum engagement range for firing systems is expected to be ~2.5kilometers, however, this will be situationally dependent.<BR> 	The IFPC Inc2-I system shall be able to transition from road-march configuration to emplacement in less than thirty minutes in a modular configuration.<BR> 	The RAM threat is identified in Annex 1.  Additional RAM threat information is available upon request for companies eligible to receive and store SECRET level information.  <BR><BR>Cost and Schedule Estimates:  As part of this response, a detailed schedule and a cost breakout is requested in constant FY 2011 dollars.  This will enable reviewers to help determine concept viability in terms of affordability.  The cost data should be provided in accordance with level three work breakdown structure detail as defined in MIL-HDBK-881A (however, other presentation formats are acceptable).  Additionally, the anticipated cost for the theoretical first unit (T1) of each major component should be provided.  Relevant assumptions to include the learning curve used to achieve this average unit manufacturing cost should be provided.  Man-month loading should be broken out by acquisition phase then by component then by functional area.  The USG is interested in proposed system concepts to include working prototypes (if available) that demonstrate affordability, technology maturity and the system's ability to meet desired programmatic constraints.  Hardware, software, and model & simulation demonstrations along with testing data that are available should support concept performance estimates presented in responses.  Respondents are requested to provide a cost and schedule estimate for full scale demonstrations of the approach using prototype(s) of the proposed system.  It is the Government's desire that production of 50-100 stand-alone IFPC Inc2-I systems be completed within 3 years of a successful Full-Rate Production (FRP) decision.  <BR><BR>Key assessment criteria include: <BR> 	Expected performance<BR> 	Cost and schedule<BR> 	System complexity and ability to integrate within existing battle command architectures<BR> 	Technical maturity and developmental risk of the integrated concept and elements <BR> 	Extent to which existing capabilities and hardware are utilized. <BR><BR>Contracting Strategy:  As part of the accelerated acquisition process and in concert with the guidance within the Weapon System Reform Act, it is the intent of the CMDS Project Office to execute the IFPC Inc2-I development program with a competitive Technology Development (TD)/prototyping phase, followed by Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD) phase, followed by a Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) contract vehicle.  The TD Phase is anticipated to be at least 2 competitively awarded cost-type contracts where awardees will be incentivized to meet schedule goals with specific performance milestones.  The EMD and LRIP Phases are anticipated to be options included in the proposals for the initial TD phase.  FRP will be a separate fixed-price contract.<BR><BR>Component Attributes:  The key goals for IFPC Inc2-I is affordability and timely delivery of the system to the Warfighter.  The following are key attributes that should be described for each component.  <BR><BR>Technical Fire Control: The Technical Fire Control (TFC) system ties the other major end items for IFPC Inc2-I together into an integrated system.  The TFC connects the IFPC Inc2-I firing system with external C2 and surveillance sensors.  It provides personnel manning the IFPC Inc2-I system with a method to interact with the system (man-machine interface).   Proposed concepts have the flexibility to allocate engagement sequence functions to the TFC, the fire direction subsystem or interceptor components.  However, all functions in the engagement, system control and maintenance should be clearly identified and allocated to specific components.  Responder assumptions on amount of new software development, amount and details on utilization of existing software are requested.<BR><BR>Fire Control Sensor: The sensor component will have the required capability to support end-to-end engagements of the entire RAM threat set.  The sensor will use a cue to acquire a specific threat from the TFC, provide precise target tracking in support threat acquisition and assess mission success.  While there may be an inherent surveillance capability provided by the sensor, the primary mission and specific requirements are to be focused on detecting, tracking and providing required support for a successful engagement.<BR><BR>Interceptor (Kinetic or Directed Energy):  The proposed intercept design shall identify key components and their associated cost.  Concepts shall identify the pedigree of each component and describe any use in previous systems.  The proposed intercept concept will be demonstrated in its final tactical configuration prior to Milestone B.  <BR><BR>Launcher:  The launcher shall provide the means to house, protect and launch the number of interceptors needed to meet the number of engagements prior to reload.  If a new launcher, assumptions on its functions, weight, power and transportability shall be stated.  A specific timeline to demonstrate how the launcher is to be integrated into the IFPC Inc2-I demonstration prior to the Preliminary Design Review (PDR) should be provided.  <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>ANNEX<BR>-	UNCLAS Indirect Fire and the Operational Environment<BR><BR>Documentation available upon request (IAW limitations of ITAR and Arms Export Control Act restrictions)<BR>-	IFPC CONOP<BR>-	SECRET Threat appendix<BR>-	USG interceptor and sensor design approach<BR>-	USG kinetic energy analysis for defeat of threat systems<BR><BR><BR> <BR>RESPONSE INSTRUCTIONS <BR>The system concept, technological ideas and programmatic structures provided by respondents will be used to augment and refine the planned Government solicitation for the IFPC Inc2-I system.  These ideas must be provided in the form of a whitepaper described below.  Each whitepaper should address a single system concept.

<CONTACT>Pearlette Merriweather, Contracting Officer, Email pearlette.merriweather@nrc.gov - Joseph Widdup, Contracting Officer/Branch Chief, Email Joseph.Widdup@nrc.gov
<DESC>The purpose of this acquisition is to obtain maintenance and operational support services for an estimated 100 U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) application systems and information technology (IT) environments, as well as modernization support and documentation support through fiscal year (FY) 2021 at an estimated cost of $237 million.&nbsp; A previous sources sought notice was posted to <a href="http://www.fbo.gov">www.fbo.gov</a> for this acquisition (<a href="https://www.fbo.gov/spg/NRC/OA/DCPM/NRC-10-33-MOM/listing.html">https://www.fbo.gov/spg/NRC/OA/DCPM/NRC-10-33-MOM/listing.html</a>), and the results of the Government's analysis of that sources sought notice have been considered in developing the acquisition strategy for this acquisition.<br /><br />This acquisition is a follow-on to the current "Maintenance and Operational Support of NRC Application Systems" contract, for which the incumbent contractor is OAO Corporation; the incumbent contract number is DR-33-07-358 and related task orders.&nbsp; That contract expires on March 25, 2011 but has two additional six-month options to extend the term of the contract.<br /><br />The 10-year period of performance for this new acquisition provides 7 years for the modernization and maintenance of NRC's applications portfolio plus up to 3 years of contractor award terms that are tied to contractor performance.<br /><br />This acquisition is intended to be a multiple award, partial small business set-aside acquisition along functional area lines (some functional areas will be full and open competition, and others will be small business set-aside) that will result in award of multiple indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity&nbsp;(IDIQ) contracts&nbsp;under which firm-fixed-price, labor-hour or time-and-materials task orders may be negotiated and awarded.<br /><br />Unrestricted Full and Open Competition (F&amp;OC) functional areas in the solicitation will include:<br /><br />&nbsp;- Initial maintenance of legacy systems<br /><br />&nbsp;- Centralized environment support<br /><br />&nbsp;- Requirements and Design<br /><br />Note: Based on information currently available, it is estimated that the value of thes&nbsp;F&amp;OC&nbsp;services is approximately $97 million.<br /><br /><br />Small Business Set-Aside (SBSA) functional areas in the solicitaiton will include:<br /><br />&nbsp;- Legacy modernization and new software application development<br /><br />&nbsp;- Maintenance of modernized systems<br /><br />Note: Based on information currently available, it is estimated that the value of the SBSA services is approximately $140 million.<br /><br /><br />The evaluation factors for the non-set aside portion of the acquisition will include a Subcontracting Plan Evaluation Factor, which incentivizes offerors that are not small businesses.&nbsp; The acquisition will also include an "on-ramp/off-ramp" feature that provides flexibility in managing the agency's future requirements.&nbsp; NRC anticipates a single solicitation that will utilize&nbsp;a best value tradeoff source selection process for each of the functional areas identified above.&nbsp; This process will result in the award of multiple IDIQ contracts for all functional areas.&nbsp; The NRC anticipates cost/price and non-cost/price factors to be approximately equal in importance for each&nbsp;functional area when evaluating offers and selecting awardee(s) for those functional areas.<br /><br />After IDIQ contracts are awarded,&nbsp;individual requirements in those functional areas (except for Centralized Environment Support, wihich is intended to have only one awardee) will be competed among the awardees in those functional areas, with the result being a task order award based on that competition.&nbsp; The multiple-award, partial small business set-aside strategy will facilitate competition and maximize opportunities for small businesses over the potential 10-year contract period.&nbsp; <br /><br />It is expected as the legacy systems are retired over the course of this new acquisition, the need for services under the unrestricted full and open competition areas will decrease.&nbsp; In addition, over time, as NRC modernizes its systems, the need for legacy modernizaiton, software application development and maintenance of modernized systems services in the SBSA functional areas will grow.<br /><br />NRC will consider the question of organizational conflicts of interest (OCOI) for this acquisition, in accordance with NRC Acquisition Regulation (NRCAR) Subpart 2009.5, and will ensure compliance with OCOI requirements with regard to placement of resulting contract awards.<br /><br />The solicitation and related amendments will only be made available from this web site.&nbsp; Therefore, potential offerors are encouraged to monitor <a href="http://www.fbo.gov">www.fbo.gov</a> for information or amendments relating to this solicitation.&nbsp; The NRC currently anticipates posting the solicitation on or about February 7, 2011, with proposals due by the response date indicated in this notice.

<a href="mailto:marcus.s.overbay@us.army.mil">PEO STRI Acquisition Center</a>
<DESC>The Special Notice Posted on 10 January 2011 is replaced in its entirety with the following:<BR>The Government has a requirement for Combat Training Center-Instrumentation System Modernization (CTC-IS MOD).   The CTC-IS MOD effort will provide replacement communication systems, facilities, infrastructure, new training capabilities, and support for each the CTCs  which operate across diverse terrain topographies and RF challenges and include the  Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC), Ft Polk, LA;  National Training Center (NTC), Ft Irwin, CA;  Joint Multinational Readiness Center (JMRC), Hohenfels, Germany.  The Government requires the capability to provide two-way voice and digital communications between exercise controllers in the analysis facilities, the observer controllers in the field, and the training audience to assist in role playing, controlling the exercise, collecting data, providing training feedback, and ensuring the communications environment is reliable, available, and maintainable.  These communications systems will satisfy mobile, tactical engagement simulation and field instrumentation system requirements as well as capabilities to manage, monitor, control, and support execution of training events through voice and data messages sent between the Exercise Control (EXCON), instrumentation and Combat Trainers.  Additionally the requirements include the update of the legacy system coverage and frequency assignments to accommodate training mission needs with newer mature, available technological capabilities. <BR><BR>The Government anticipates that the CTC-IS MOD program requirement will be fulfilled during the 2nd FY 11 quarter.  This requirement was previously announced on the STRIBOP website on 01 July 2010.  A number of changes in the acquisition approach have occurred since that announcement.  Specifically, the Government no longer plans to award up to 3 short-term R&D Firm Fixed Priced (FFP) delivery orders under STOC II for RDT&A and follow-on production options.  The Government approach now plans on a contract vehicle that contains a base period of two years with three one-year option periods.  Additionally, the Government is considering several different contractual approaches to execute program requirements to include: 1) utilizing its STOC II Multiple Award IDIQ contract vehicle to issue a single task order or  2) issuing a solicitation and resultant single award IDIQ contract outside of STOC II.   Regardless of the contract approach taken by the Government, award will be made on a Best Value/Trade-off basis. <BR><BR>Attached to this notice is a draft statement of work for the CTC-IS MOD requirements.  The Government is seeking information from firms who are interested in this requirement, whether as a prime contractor or subcontractor.  Specifically the Government request that firms review the attached draft statement of work and provide feedback to the Government.

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because the procurement is awarded to a sole source under the Test Program for Certain Commercial Items (FAR 13.5). See posted J&A for further information.<br><br>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL FOR OTHER THAN FULL<BR>AND OPEN COMPETITION<BR><BR><BR>1. Contracting Activity: This acquisition is for William Beaumont Army Medical Center (WBAMC).  The contracting activity is Western Regional Contracting Office WBAMC Contracting Cell. <BR><BR>2. Description of Action:  William Beaumont Army Medical Center, Information Management Department is requesting a new sole source supply contract with McKesson Information Solutions LLC., 5995 Windward Pkwy, Alpharetta, GA  30005-4184.  The type of contract is firm-fixed price.   <BR><BR>3. Description of Supplies/Services:   Centramax Software System Technical Updates for an estimated total of $8,819.00. <BR><BR>4. Authority Cited:  FAR 13.106-1 (b) Commercial Items - Soliciting from a Single Source (brand name justification)  <BR><BR>5. Reason for Authority Cited:  This requirement is for technical updates to the Centramax Software System through 31 March 2011, at WBAMC Department of Nursing.  It is determined that McKesson Information Solutions LLC is the only source supplying technical updates for the Centramax Software System.  McKesson Information Solutions LLC is who provides the Centramax Software System therefore; the system must be updated with the compatible software in order to function.  There are no other sources for this requirement.<BR><BR>6. Efforts to Obtain Competition:  The technical updates for this software cannot be procured competitively.  The notice required by FAR 52. will be published on Federal Business Opportunities.  McKesson Information Solutions LLC is the only source supplying the technical updates compatible with the system already owned and in place at WBAMC.  The clinical content is updated annually and as needed.  McKesson Information Solutions LLC , Centramax vendor, provides a CD that automatically updates Centramax's clinical content.  The vendor provides detailed instructions to manually update or add new guidelines along with technical support. In essence, no other vendor can provide the technical updates compatible with the system already at WBAMC. <BR><BR>7. Actions to Increase Competition:  A competitive solicitation will be issued on or about 14 February because the current system will become obsolete on 1 April 2011. <BR><BR>8. Market Research:  Market Research was conducted in order to find other potential vendors who may be capable of providing compatible technical updates for Centramax Software System.  However, based on the results there is not a reasonable expectation of obtaining offers from responsible vendors providing compatible technical updates.    <BR><BR>9. Interested Sources:  To date, no other sources have written to express interest in the acquisition.  The notice required by FAR 5.201 will be published and any bids or proposals received shall be considered.<BR><BR>10.  Other Facts:  <BR><BR>a.	   Procurement history.  <BR>Contract number W81K00-09-P-0956.  This procurement was issued unrestricted, and award was made to McKesson Information Solutions LLC.  <BR><BR>b.	Acquisition data availability.  McKesson Information Solutions LLC is the only responsible source that can accomplish this requirement.   <BR><BR>c.	   Unusual and compelling urgency.  N/A<BR><BR>d.	 Subcontracting competition.  N/A<BR>
