<AWARDEE>IMAGING ONE, LLC;856 TWIN HARBOR DR;ARNOLD;MD;210121029
<DESC>Justification and Approval 
Other Than Full and Open Competition 

1. Contracting Activity : 

Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 01, 523 - Boston Healthcare System 
Purchase Request Transaction Number: 523-11-4-7821-0350 (replaced by 523-12-1-7167-0005)

2. Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed : 

This for the procurement of three Zero Gravity Radiation Protection Ceiling Mounted Shields from the vendor Imaging One LLC. This will be a new contract provided to the vendor. 

3. Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs : 

The commodities being procured are three Zero Gravity Radiation Protection Ceiling Mounted Shields manufactured by CFI Medical for the existing Cath Labs at the VHA Boston Healthcare System, West Roxbury campus. These are lead shields to protect the clinicians from radiation during clinical procedures during Cath cases. 

4. Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition: 

(X) (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1; 
( ) (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2; 
( ) (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability 
or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3; 
( ) (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4 
( ) (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5; 
( ) (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6; 
( ) (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7; 

5. Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority) : 

The Zero Gravity Radiation Protection Ceiling mounted shields provided by Imaging One LLC. are unique because based on market research, there is no comparable product that provides full body radiation protection for the clinicians during an imaging procedure which isn't draped over a clinician. All other full body radiation shielding products are draped onto the clinicians and worn as lead aprons, placing an unnecessarily heavy burden on the clinicians and restricting clinician mobility during the procedure. The Zero Gravity Shields are attached to the ceiling and remove the weight of the lead from the clinicians. Currently the only source able to provide the Zero Gravity RP Shields is Imaging One LLC. 

6. Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable : 

An RFQ for the procurement this commodity was put out on FEDBID during the last quarter, however there were no sources that responded to the solicitation. 

7. Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable : 

Pricing is considered fair and reasonable from Imaging One based on a 3% discount offered to the Government over pricing offered to their other commercial customers. 

8. Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted : 

An RFQ for the procurement this commodity was put out on FEDBID during the last quarter, however there were no sources that responded to the request. Attending trades shows and online market research has shown that Imaging One is the only provider of the Zero Gravity RPS product. 

9. Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition : 

All facts provided in previous sections. 

10. Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition: 

The only source expressing interest in the acquisition is Imaging One LLC. 

11. A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required : 

At this time no additional actions are planned because an RFQ was put out on FEDBDZ, however there were no responses. For future requirements, market research will be conducted to see if other companies in the industry have developed like products/technology.

d.	Device, isolator clamp OLL2
e.	Device, isolator pen MAX1

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  

	(x)  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	(  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;

	(  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):  

Atricure is the only known source that provides these disposable items.  These specific disposables are used in conjunction with VA owned equipment: Atricure Sensing and Ablation Unit Model #ASU2-115 and Isolator Control Module Model #ASB3.  The disposables must be compatible with these units to complete isolator transpolar ablation system.

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  

Research conducted on Governmental Website and the NAC failed to locate other responsible sources that may be able to provide a similar product that will meet Service needs.  Therefore, to the best of my knowledge, this is the only known source that provides these specific instruments.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  

The anticipated cost of this procurement is fair and reasonable to the Government based upon past purchases.  Pricing is comparable to pricing offered to Atricure's other commercial customers.  

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  None.  

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  

Atricure is the manufacturer of the product.  To the best of my knowledge, there are no authorized dealers or distributors of the product. Product is used in conjunction with VA owned equipment on station, therefore, Atricure Inc is sole source.  FAR 6.302-1(b)(2).

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  None.


11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  

These supplies are for VA-owned equipment and Atricure is the sole source provider.  Barriers to competition will only be removed when the VA Boston Healthcare System replaces the existing equipment.
Market research will continue to be conducted as each requirement is received.
