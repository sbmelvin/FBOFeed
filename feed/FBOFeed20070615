<DESC>The purpose of this project is to replace a deficient trail bridge across palisades creek with a premanufactured steel truss bridge.  Work will consist of constructing bridge, bridge abutments and backfill/approach grade.   Trail work will be done by others. 

	Located approximately 6 miles up forest trail 084, trail 112 begins at the crossing of palisades creek.  The Forest Service plans on relocating the crossing location downstream approximately 200 feet.  At this location the hillside meets the flood plain.  Across the stream from this location is an elevated bench that tapers down to stream level.  The design length of the bridge is 60 ft.  Excavation to set the abutments and place fill behind to bring up to grade will be necessary.  Access to the site is by non-motorized trail.  It is anticipated that the bridge will be delivered to the site via helicopter in one piece and other material packed in by horse or helicopter.  Motorized vehicles are not allowed in the area, however such equipment as generators, compressors and jumping jack style compactors will be permitted.  The Forest Service will locate material borrow source(s) prior to construction.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Acquisition and Grants Office, NESDIS Acquisition Division intends to issue a solicitation on an unrestricted basis utilizing the procedures at Federal Acquisition Regulations Part 15 for the award of a cost reimbursement contract for critical expertise for the project entitled "Microwave Imager/Sounder (MIS) Technical Support for Requirements Specification Activities Regarding Climatology and Numerical Weather Prediction." The North America Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code is 541710 with a Size Standard of 500 employees.

Background: The National Polar-orbiting Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) is a satellite system used to monitor global environmental conditions, and collect and disseminate data related to: weather, atmosphere, oceans, land and the near-space environment. The NPOESS Integrated Program Office (IPO) organizationally resides within the Department of Commerce, NOAA National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service (NESDIS). The Department of Commerce, the Department of Defense, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), created the IPO to develop, acquire, manage, and operate the NPOESS satellites. Details on NPOESS can be found at http://npoess.noaa.gov. The NPOESS requirements were developed by the user community and are captured in the NPOESS Integrated Operational Requirements Document (IORD).

To achieve its mission, the IPO has undertaken a far-reaching program of sensor development, and satellite transition and evolution to provide complete coverage of environmental conditions for civil, military, and scientific purposes. NPOESS data will be processed into Environmental Data Records (EDRs) for use by a number of operational communities. The IPO?s operational effectiveness depends on its ability to keep pace with rapidly developing technologies.

To accomplish this, the IPO researches and develops initiatives through its Internal Government Studies (IGS) program. The IGS program consists of teams of scientists and engineers from Government laboratories and centers, Federally-Funded Research and Development Centers, universities, and industry.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Acquisition and Grants Office, NESDIS Acquisition Division intends to issue a solicitation on an unrestricted basis utilizing the procedures at Federal Acquisition Regulations Part 15 for the award of a cost reimbursement contract for critical expertise for the project entitled "Microwave Imager/Sounder (MIS) Technical Support for Sensor Development and Requirements Specification."  The North America Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code is 541710 with a Size Standard of 500 employees. 

Background: The National Polar-orbiting Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) is a satellite system used to monitor global environmental conditions, and collect and disseminate data related to: weather, atmosphere, oceans, land and the near-space environment. The NPOESS Integrated Program Office (IPO) organizationally resides within the Department of Commerce, NOAA National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service (NESDIS). The Department of Commerce, the Department of Defense, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), created the IPO to develop, acquire, manage, and operate the NPOESS satellites. Details on NPOESS can be found at http://npoess.noaa.gov. The NPOESS requirements were developed by the user community and are captured in the NPOESS Integrated Operational Requirements Document (IORD).

To achieve its mission, the IPO has undertaken a far-reaching program of sensor development, and satellite transition and evolution to provide complete coverage of environmental conditions for civil, military, and scientific purposes. NPOESS data will be processed into Environmental Data Records (EDRs) for use by a number of operational communities. The IPO's operational effectiveness depends on its ability to keep pace with rapidly developing technologies.

To accomplish this, the IPO researches and develops initiatives through its Internal Government Studies (IGS) program. The IGS program consists of teams of scientists and engineers from Government laboratories and centers, Federally-Funded Research and Development Centers, universities, and industry. These teams are tasked to identify and test technologies and techniques, which meet NPOESS requirements and objectives.

Requirements: This acquisition will support the following areas of study: (1) Provide detailed review and recommendation of program priorities in the MIS Sensor Data Record (SDR) and EDR qualities and attributes; (2) Provide technical support for MIS sensor specification development and performance analysis; (3) Provide technical support for the development and testing of an on-board calibration subsystem for the MIS sensor; (4) Provide technical support for the development of pre-launch and post-launch characterization, calibration/validation, and test, plans and technologies for end-to-end sensor performance; (5) Develop enhancements and improvements to heritage MIS EDR retrieval algorithms; and (6) Support the Microwave Operational Algorithm Team (MOAT) and Microwave Imager Sounder team meetings. The technical support contracted under this acquisition will continue through the instrument procurement. The contractor will advise the agency during the acquisition phase and development of the sensor. The support will include analysis of design options, technical evaluation with recommendations, and review of technical documentation.  

Evaluation and Basis for Award: The resultant contract will be for a period of one year commencing on or about September 1, 2007 and will include four 12-month option periods. The Government anticipates the award of a cost reimbursement contract on the basis of best value. All evaluation factors, which will be outlined in the RFP, other than cost or price are significantly more important than cost or price. In the event that the evaluation findings result in substantially equal technical proposals, the price will become more important as a determining factor.

Quincy court is directly in the middle of the block, east of the E. M. Dirksen U.S. Courthouse and flanked by 230 S. State Street and 220 S. State Street.

<DESC>Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD), is procuring 30 hydrophones Model TC4032-5 and 30 7-pin female Jupiter mating connector assemblies. NSWCCD intends to negotiate a non-competitive procurement using Simplified Acquisition Procedures and award a firm-fixed price purchase order to Reson, Inc. These sensors were chosen because they are compatible with the exiting mechanical mounting configurations and they meet the necessary electrical output signal levels; it would not be cost effective to use another vendor. A determination by the Government to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties may forward their capabilities statements to the Government POC on or before 06/29/2007.

In addition to the lack of responses from the FedBizOpps posted market survey, the sole source
determination is based upon the fact that Recreation & Welfare Association is the only source available at the time to accommodate NHLBI/NIH urgent needs to the institutes? required CFC activities.  The R & W   is uniquely qualified for this contract and has a long history of conducting these sources for the NIH.  The R&W will also take on additional responsibilities this year not included in previous work.  Including attending meetings in the DHHS Secretary?s office for NIH CFC staff, 	participating in the development and execution of training sessions for Deputy and Assistant Coordinators, recommending goals, serving a s point of contact for recruitment, training and guidance for keyworkers specifically for the NIH Office of the Director, Office of Research Services and the Clinical Center, and coordinating the deliver of all supplies provided by the CFC to NIH Coordinators prior to keyworker training. At this time, it would not be time effective to search for and hire a new vendor.  Hiring a new vendor may require more time needed to educate vendor on the NIH CFC campaign.  This will cause a delay in completing all requirements for the campaign.  In order to maintain the continuity of the methodologies used from previous successful CFC activities and due to the knowledge, skills, and experience gained by The Recreation & Welfare Association?s various CFC positions, an award to any other source for this years CFC would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  To further substantiate the sole source determination, The Recreation & Welfare Association?s qualifications, skills, and experience was evaluated against the following technical evaluation criteria: 1) Understanding the Requirement. 50 possible points. Documented evidence which clearly reflects the organizational / individuals experience in providing similar services. The technical approach, experience, skills, demonstrated understanding of statement of work, demonstrated skill in combined federal campaigns, and demonstrated writing skills. 2) Past Performance. 30 possible points. A minimum of 5 years of demonstrated exceptional past performance in providing services of a similar magnitude; 3) Knowledge of the National Institutes of Health. 20 possible points. Demonstrated knowledge of the National Institutes of Health programs and academic institutions. The Recreation & Welfare Association is the only known source capability of provided the services stated herein. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit a proposal. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all responses and / or proposals received within ten (10) days after posting of this announcement will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is 
solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future procurement competitively.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for flight test article (FTA) transporter mobilizers consisting of three (3) refurbished 25-ton capacity container loading trailer (CLT) system mobilizers; one (1) refurbished C-130 loading kit (20-ton capacity) (modified to incorporate a new portable hydraulic power unit); & one (1) new auxiliary roller set (CLT) in support of NASA’s Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) Program. The CEV consists of a Service Module (SM), Crew Module (CM) with a shape similar to the Apollo Command Module, and a Launch Abort System (LAS). An important feature of the CEV is the LAS, which has been designed to protect the crew by providing the capability to propel the CM away from the launch vehicle in the event of a problem on the launch pad or during the ascent phase of a mission.  The LAS will undergo a series of flight tests to demonstrate its performance and functional capability throughout the required CEV flight envelope.  The LAS abort flight testing will be conducted out of the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico.  In support of this testing, Langley Research Center (LaRC) is designing and fabricating flight test articles resembling the CM and the upper, Separation Ring (SepRing) portion of the Service Module.  The CM and SepRing will be transported in specially designed fixtures that will be ramp-loaded and transported on a USAF C-17 Globemaster aircraft.  The transportation fixtures will have local, highway, and off-road mobility capability. The fixtures with their installed Flight Test Articles (CM, SepRing, and CM/ SepRing assembly) have estimated weights of between 24,000-36,000 lbs. The fixtures will be equipped with ISO Intermodal Container-compatible end frames with ISO Corner fittings. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the FTA transporter mobilizers from DCS Group of Denmark, through CDK Mobile Systems, their sole-North American Licensee as they are the only known source that can meet all the NASA LaRC requirements relative to capacity, capability, cost, and delivery, and they have demonstrated an ability to manufacture and field the described units. The required delivery time of the first CLT System Mobilizer is mid-October 2007, and mid-late November 2007 for the balance of equipment. The government intends on purchasing refurbished units if available. Refurbished includes but is not limited to repair, reconditioning, parts replacement, repainting and any other operations to bring the unit up to the manufacturer’s full performance standard for new units of the same description, and tested and otherwise verified to meet that standard. The mobilizers shall have the capability to lift 25 tons to a height of at least 60 inches. The mobilizers will be used to ramp-load the fixtures into a C-17 aircraft.  The mobilizers shall be capable of raising and lowering wheel height to negotiate the aircraft loading ramp and not violate the height and width restrictions of the aircraft. The mobilizers shall be capable of breaking down into modular sections that can be removed from the aircraft. The mobilizers shall be self propelled during attachment and un-attachment operations. The mobilizers shall provide for mechanical attachment.  The mobilizers will be used to attach to several government manufactured fixtures, and shall provide secure removable joints for attachment.  The mobilizers shall facilitate towing of government fixtures loaded to the capacity sited above.  Mobilizers shall have the capability to be towed at speeds up to 55 M.P.H and shall adhere to Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. The C-130 loading kit shall: utilize the same ISO corner fitting attachment scheme & hydraulic adjustment mechanism as the mobilizer, but with a dual-axle 16-wheel (80PSI pneumatic) tire configuration to the same 25 ton load; permit loading of fixtures without “trapping” the kit inside the aircraft, by disassembly and removal via the aircraft crew side door; and it shall be equipped with its own portable Hydraulic Power Unit (HPU) for the operation of the Kit’s hydraulic system and steering.	The auxiliary roller set shall be a set of two (2) housings each equipped with a series of rollers and attachable to the lower beam of a CLT mobilizer half, via twist-lock bolts, and capable of supporting the beam assembly to permit 3-wheeled maneuverability on the aircraft with out “tilting” the beam section to provide ease of handling on the aircraft. The Government intends to acquire these commercial items using FAR Part 12. Authority for the Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition is provided by FAR 6.302-1 - Only one responsible source and FAR 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items (PL 104-106, Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 as amended by PL 109-163, Section 1443 of the FY 2006 National Defense Authorization Act). This authority is available for use in acquiring commercial items not exceeding $5.5 million. CDK Mobile Systems is the only responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements under the authority 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1). The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12 and Part 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on June 26, 2007.

<DESC>CDC, NIOSH, Cincinnati Research Laboratory intend to issue a request for quotation (RFQ) to obtain  Microscopic Scoring of Human Lymphocyte Micronucleus Assay
		           
BACKGROUND

As a part of the recent NIOSH  project ?Determination of Antineoplastic Drug Exposure in Health Care Workers? field studies were conducted from March to October 2006.  The goals of the project were to determine worker potential exposure to antineoplastic drugs by various methodologies including worker reported use and environmental and biological sampling.  For biological sampling, urine was collected for measurement of antineoplastic drugs and blood collected for various cytogenetic assays including the COMET and lymphocyte micronucleus assay.  Whole blood samples were collected from each participant, and shipped to Taft Laboratories in Cincinnati, Ohio.  Lymphocyte cytokinesis-block cultures were initiated and cytoslides were prepared for microscopic scoring.  The results of scoring will be used to assess exposure of individuals to antineoplastic drugs by noting the presence of cellular morphologic and structural features characteristic of antineoplastic exposure.  Scoring and enumeration of micronuclei in human lymphocytes is a research function.  Micronucleus (MN) levels may vary in humans due to dietary exposure, age, sex and smoking. The presence of micronuclei and nucleoplasmic bridges has no clinical relevance, and their presence is not used medically to indicate health status.

Two levels of Micronucleus (MN) analyses in human lymphocytes are available: 1) "Classic" Fenech approach, which includes MN scoring in 1000 bi-nucleated cells and establishing a nuclear division index (NDI) in 500 cells to assess proliferation as described in  Fenech et. al. 2000 (Mutation Research 445:81-95) and Fenech et.al. 2003 (Mutation Research 534:65-75.)  2)  "State of the Art - Cytome Assay" is a  more advanced approach, also suggested by  Fenech and validated by the International Committee on Micronucleus Assay (http://www.humn.org), includes scoring for MN in 1000 binucleated cells (at least 1000 binucleated cells are scored, or 500 from each replicate culture), a replicative index, as well as nucleoplasmic bridges (in binucleated cells) and other endpoints related to genetic damage, cell death and proliferation (nuclear buds, apoptotic cells, and necrotic cells) as fully described in Fenech et. al. 2006 (Mutation Research 600:58-66.)
The research goals described in the  Research Project: Determination of Antineoplastic Drug Exposure in Health Care Workers will be served best if scoring services are conducted at the second level ?State of the Art ? Cytome Assay? as described above.  For reward of contract the vendor is required to provide scoring services at the second level of analysis. 
PURPOSE

The purpose of this contract is to obtain microscopic scoring of cytoslides prepared from human lymphocyte cytokinesis-block cultures and receive documentation of the results of this microscopic analysis.

SCOPE OF WORK

The vendor shall provide all labor, materials and equipment to complete the tasks outlined below.  Scoring of cytoslides from each participant shall be conducted using cytoslides provided by NIOSH that have been prepared from replicate cultures.  The vendor shall score 1000 binucleated lymphocytes: 500 cells from culture A and 500 from culture B.  With only two exceptions NIOSH will provide a total of four cytoslides; two slides prepared from each replicate culture per study participant.  While at least two slides must be viewed, initial scoring of slides indicate in many instances three to four slides will be needed to score 1000 binucleated cells. The vendor will be required to return all cytoslides provided by NIOSH upon completion of services by Federal Express or other appropriate shipping and delivery service, and include an inventory of all slides returned.  Slides shall be returned in several shipments as received from NIOSH. 

TASK TO BE PERFORMED

The vendor shall perform the following minimum task:

A.   Perform microscopic scoring of cytoslides provided by NIOSH at the first or 
       ?Classic? level by:
  
   1.  Scoring or enumerating micronuclei present in 1000 binuclear lymphocytes using
        the scoring criteria established by the Human Micronucleus Project,  Fenech et.al.
        2003 (Mutation Research 600:58-66.)
          

   2.  Establish a Nuclear Division Index (NDI) by enumerating 500 mono-, bi-, tri- and   
        tetranucleated cells.   
	                           NDI = [M1 + 2(M2) +3(M3) + 4(M4)] / N
    
        Where M1- M4 represent the number of cells with one to four nuclei and N is the   
         total number of cells counted (500). The vendor shall score 250 cells from each
         replicate culture.                       
  
   3.  Provide an estimate of experimental variation and the effect of scorer bias as
        described in Fenech 2000 in which estimates are based upon results from duplicate 
        cultures and preparation of a total of four cytoslides. With two exceptions four 
        cytoslides have been prepared for each participant.
 
B.  The vendor providing scoring services at the preferred ?State of the Art ? Cytome    
      Assay? shall include additional cytological end points as described in Fenech 2006:

      1.  Scoring or enumeration of binucleated cells containing nucleoplasmic bridges.
      2.  Enumerate mononuclear cells containing one or more micronuclei.
      3.  Enumerate binuclear cells containing nuclei with nuclear buds.
      4.  Enumerate apoptotic and necrotic cells in 500 cells.
      5.  Establish a Nuclear Division Cytotoxicity Index by enumerating 500 mono-, bi-,   
           tri- and tetranucleated cells and using the formula:  
           
                                    NDCI = [Ap + Nec + M1 + 2(M2) +3(M3) + 4(M4)] / N*
    
           Where Ap = number of apoptotic cells, Nec = number of necrotic cells and N* =
            the total number of cells scored (viable and non-viable).     
      
     6.  Provide an estimate of experimental variation and effect of scorer bias as described 
          above in item A.3.

C.  The vendor shall provide on a Scoring Sheet for each participant assay the following information.
      Score Sheets for ?Classic? assays will include the following information:

      1.  Code Number of each slide.
      2.  The number of slides examined to score 1000 binuclear cells.
      3.  Number of binuclear cells scored.
      4.  The distribution of binuclear cells with 0, 1, 2, 3 or more micronuclei in 1000      
           binuclear cells.
      5.  Total number of micronuclei in binuclear cells.
      6.  The frequency of micronuclei in 1000 binuclear cells.
      7.  The frequency of micronucleated binuclear cells in 1000 binucleated cells.
      8.  The proportion of mono-, bi-, tri- and tetranucleated cells in 500 viable cells.
      9.  The frequency of binucleated cells in a total of 500 viable cells.
    10.  The Nuclear Division Index
    11. Coefficient of variation for duplicate estimates of the above parameters.

      Score Sheets for ?State of the Art ? Cytome Assays? shall provide the additional information:

      1.  The proportion of binucleated cells containing nucleoplasmic bridges.
      2.  The proportion of mononucleated cells containing one or more micronuclei.
      3.  The proportion of binucleated cells containing nuclei with nuclear buds.
      4.  The proportion of cells undergoing apoptosis or necrosis in 500 cells. 
      5.  The Nuclear Division Cytotoxicity Index.
      6.  Coefficient of variation for duplicate estimates of the above parameters.

The pricing for the work will be on a cost reimbursable basis with an award fee at risk based on performance.  The sequence and technology selection of the installations has not been determined.  The scope of work will be defined for all planned and any potential future projects, if any, and authorized separately on a project-by-project basis according to the approved budget.  TVA may elect to expand the initial project(s) to provide for additional work at other locations.  Accordingly, TVA will award a contract(s) with a company which is, alone or in teaming arrangements or consortiums with others, capable of providing the support work in a long term alliance.  If such a contractual arrangement is entered into, TVA will reserve the right to delay commitment to subsequent projects to evaluate initial performance on the initial installation in order to better ascertain the long term suitability of the contractor.

TVA desires to select firm(s) that have a history of successful experience with CC and CT projects that are similar to those described in the enclosure entitled Mandatory Minimum Qualification Certification.  Therefore, in order to receive the RFP, TVA requires that all prospective respondents meet these requirements before being further considered.  All prospective respondents must first certify compliance with the requirements contained on the Mandatory Minimum Qualification Certification.  Firms which certify to TVA that they can fully meet all of the mandatory minimum qualification requirements will receive a copy of the RFP and will be invited to attend a mandatory preproposal meeting. All offerors will be required to present detailed data (later with their proposals) to substantiate compliance with each of the mandatory minimum qualification requirements.

In order to be considered, we must receive a signed Minimum Qualification Certification Statement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<CONTACT>Thomas Williamson, Senior Procurement Specialist, Phone 702-295-4071, Fax 702-295-9137, Email williata@nv.doe.gov
<DESC>Purpose:  To describe the work to be included in a contract to modify the Visual Examination and Repackaging Building (VERB) Secondary Containment Structure (SCS), also known as the Perma-Con?, to support Oversized Box Repackaging planned for Project 7005.

Statement of Work:  This work will modify the current structure of the VERB SCS originally constructed under previous contract and described in the drawings shown in the Drawings List.

This contract will include the design and fabrication necessary to: 

1.	Expand the SCS airlock doors from current dimensions to an 8-foot opening to allow the entry of the oversized boxes with the largest overall dimensions of L=164", W=76", H=81".

2.	The SCS design shall include the identification of locations in the SCS structure for the installation of appropriately sized ventilation ports to allow the total air flow of approximately 6000 cfm into the SCS.  These ports will be provided with removable filtration of appropriate size and construction to support the design.

3.	The SCS will be modified to include an exhaust filter bank to accommodate the 6000 cfm from the High Contamination Area (HCA) portion of the SCS.  This filter bank shall be constructed to at or near floor level to minimize contamination spread throughout the HCA.

4.	The SCS will be modified to add two moveable point ventilation sources in the HCA section of the SCS.  These point ventilation sources will be equipped with independent HEPA filtration as shown in Drawing 07005-005-32-M2 of the VERB design package.  These moveable point sources must have a range of motion from floor level to a height of 81".

5.	The design will include exhaust ducting from the exhaust filter bank to the exhaust fan isolation dampers HVAC-DMP-101, HVAC-DMP-201 and HVAC-DMP-301 as shown in Drawing 07005-005-32-M2.

6.	The design will maintain the PC2 functional classification for seismic consistent with the original design of the SCS.

7.	The contract will include costs associated with the transport and supervision of installation of all designed and fabricated equipment.

8.	Design calculations will be provided by the vendor to demonstrate adequacy of design for airflows and seismic events.

<DESC>The Global Systems Positioning Wing will post the final Request for Proposal number FA8807-06-R-0001 for the GPS IIIA Space Vehicle to the GPS Bidders Library ON OR BEFORE 22 JUNE 2007.  The Navstar GPS is a satellite-based radio navigation system that serves military and civil users worldwide. GPS IIIA will maintain constellation sustainment, provide existing capabilities, plus introduction of a new L1C civil signal, increased earth coverage M-code power for authorized military users, a graceful growth path to achieve full CDD threshold requirements, and continuing support for the NDS mission, to serve the evolving needs of GPS military and civil users.  GPS IIIA is an Acquisition Category 1D program.  The GPS must comply with 10 United States Code (USC) 2281 that requires that the Secretary of Defense ensure the continued sustainment and operation of GPS for military and civilian purposes and 42 USC 4712 and comply with certain standards and facilitates international cooperation.  This acquisition effort executes these statutory mandates.

BIDDER?S LIBRARY:  
The RFP and attachments can be found under Bidders-Block III at https://gps.losangeles.af.mil/gpslibrary/.  

The DoD recently mandated the Public Key infrastructure (PKI) requiring all DoD restricted web sites and web-based applications to verify users via digital identification certificates, rather than via a username and password, before granting access. 

In order to access the Bidder's Library and view the GPS IIIA RFP or any of the afore mentioned systems, each contractor must have the following PKI components: 

(a) A DoD Common Access Card (CAC) with a valid PKI certificate, along with a CAC reader and software, or 
(b) A DoD-approved External Certification Authority (ECA) certificate (http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html). 

This process may take up to 8 days to complete and there is a nominal fee. 
OMBUDSMAN:  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from potential offerors.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is to receive and communicate concerns from potential offerors when an offeror prefers not to use established channels to communicate his/her concern during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The Ombudsman will communicate certain offeror issues, disagreements, and recommendations on this acquisition into the proper channels.  The Ombudsmans role is not to diminish the authority of the program director or the contracting officer but to advocate an offerors concern on a non-attribution basis.  The Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern when requested by the offeror.  The Ombudsman will not participate in the evaluation of proposals or the source selection process for this acquisition.  The Ombudsman is Mr. John Wagner, and he can be reached at john.wagner@losangeles.af.mil or at (310) 653-2138.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Multi Function Aiming Device
<SOLNBR>MFAD0001
<RESPDATE>062207
<ARCHDATE>07072007
<CONTACT>Richard Boast, Contracting Officer, Phone 813-826-7975, Fax 813-826-7504, Email richard.boast@socom.mil
<DESC>Background

This is a market survey to locate potential sources for the development of a Multi-Function Aiming Device.  The United States Special Operations (USSOCOM) is attempting to improve the effectiveness of their soldiers by developing a fully integrated Multi-Function Aiming Device (MFAD) for engaging targets in close quarters combat.  

Combat operations require the soldier to accurately engage enemy personnel targets in Military Operations on Urban Terrain (MOUNT) environments at ranges of 200 meters and closer.  These close quarter battle operations may require the soldier to clear buildings with multiple rooms over extended periods of time.  Reducing the weight of ancillary equipment (e.g. lasers, lights, pistol grips, etc.) and freeing up rail space on the front hand guard of the soldier?s weapon system in order to maintain a stable and solid firing position is critical to mission success.  These factors will reduce soldier fatigue and free the weapon system of obstructions in order to accurately engage enemy personnel targets.  The MFAD shall incorporate the following components into a single, integrated system: a day sight, Infrared (IR) laser pointer, IR illuminator, visible laser pointer, and white light flashlight.

This Request for Information (RFI) is to assist the Government in determining the extent and capabilities of existing technology to meet the requirements of the MFAD.  The Government places emphasis on the proposed system?s size, light weight, and its ability to achieve the stated requirements.   The Government anticipates a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) to be published in 4Q FY07 or 1QFY08 based on the outcome of this RFI. 

The Government requests respondees provide a plan to achieve the Threshold/Objective (T/O) requirements in a concise manner which shall consist of no greater than 10 pages and be composed in Times New Roman 12 pt font.    The Government requests that the offeror?s intended plan include a Schedule and Compliance Matrix detailing the plan?s compliance to stated specifications.  The intended plan shall also include an estimated cost which shall consist of all design, development, non-recurring engineering and production costs for 10 prototype units which shall be used for testing and operational evaluation by the user.  Additionally, respondees shall submit a proposed production plan to meet fabrication requirements from approximately 2,300 units to a total production potential of 10,000 units.

Required Specifications

The United States Special Operations Command has identified the following required specifications of the prototype MFAD system.

1.	The MFAD?s day sight, IR laser, IR illuminator, visible laser, and white light flashlight shall be integrated into a single system.  No component shall be a separate item (T/O).  The objective is to reduce rail space consumption.

2.	The MFAD shall meet the following size specifications: 
a.	Length: Not to exceed 5 inches (T), 2.5 inches (O)
b.	Width: Not to exceed 3.5 inches (T), 2 inches (O)
c.	Height: Not to exceed 4 inches (T), 2 inches (O)
d.	Weight: Not to exceed 15 oz. (T), 10 oz (O)

3.	Waterproofing: The MFAD shall be functional when immersed in sea water at a depth of 1 meter for 2 hours (T) and at 1 Atmosphere (depth 33 ft) for 2 hours additionally in sea water (O).

4.	The MFAD shall be capable of being operated and stored under temperature conditions that range from:

a.	Minimum Temperature: -25 degrees F operational (T) and -31 degrees F storage (T) and -40 degrees F for both operational and storage (O).
b.	Maximum  Temperature: 125 degrees F operational (T/O) and 159 degrees F Storage (T/O)
c.	Operational Altitude: above 15,000 feet (T) and 50,000 feet (O)
d.	Operational in Humidity: 100 percent (T/O)

5.	The MFAD shall have auto adjusting brightness (T/O); brighter in light conditions and dimmer in dark conditions.

6.	The MFAD shall have a manual override for brightness of the sight (T/O).

7.	The MFAD?s aiming point shall have a 2 Minute of Angel (MOA) dot (T/O).  The dot shall be enclosed by a circle for quick acquisition and the device shall have a 400 meter aiming point set for a 5.56 mm, 70 grain round from a 14.5 inch barrel (T/O).

8.	The power source for the MFAD shall be CR-123 batteries (T); new lightweight battery technology used to reduce overall weight of the system (O).

9.	The Laser selector switch shall be configured as follows:
a.	OFF (T/O)
b.	Dual Low, visible laser (T/O)
c.	Dual High, visible laser (T/O)
d.	Flood High, visible laser (T/O)

10.	Both the IR and visible lasers shall have their own pressure pad (T/O).

11.	The MFAD shall mount to a MIL-STD 1913 rail (T/O).

12.	All laser output power data shall be provided in milliWatts (mW) (T/O)

Performance Requirements

The United States Special Operations Command has identified the following performance requirements for MFAD system:

1.	The low power pointer shall have a .600 mW laser (T/O)
a.	Divergence: 0.5 mrad (T), 0.25 mrad (O)
2.	The low power flood shall be at 3 mW plus or minus 0.45 mW (T/O).
a.	Adjustable divergence: 1 mrad to 105 mrad (T), 1 mrad to 155 mrad (O).
3.	The high power pointer shall have a 30 mW laser (T/O)

4.	The high power flood shall have a 100 mW laser.
a.	Adjustable divergence: 1 mrad to 105 mrad (T), 1 mrad to 155 mrad (O).

5.	The system shall have a visible green or red laser (T/O)
a.	Divergence: 0.5 mrad (T), 0.25 mrad (O).

6.	The visible laser output power in the dual low/visible laser setting shall be 30 mW (T/O).

7.	The visible laser output power in the dual high/visible laser setting shall be 30 mW (T), 150 mW (O).

8.	Illuminators shall have a diffuser that produces a uniform flood (T/O).

9.	The white light flashlight shall have an output of 100 lumens and employ a light emitting diode (LED) (T).  

This announcement is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP).  There is no solicitation available at this time. This notice is published for information purposes only and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. The Government will not pay for information received as a result of this announcement.


Points of Contact:
Questions of a technical nature shall be directed to the cognizant Technical Point of
Contact, as specified below:

Facsimile Number: (703) 704-3574
E-mail Address: charlie.hough@us.army.mil

Question:	On the illuminator flood uniformity, do you mean that the luminance is to be even over an illumination field (e.g. a flat top), or can the illumination pattern simply be smooth (e.g. a Gaussian)?  Do you have a preference on the shape of the illumination field (e.g. a square or a circle)? 

Answer:  We would like to have a circular and an even illumination flood.

Question:  In the requirements section of the sources sought there is no real specific section that talks about what weapon platform you desire the MFAD to be used on. Only section 7, which deals with aim point characteristics, comes close, where it states ??.. and the device shall have a 400 meter aiming point set for a 5.56mm, 70 gain round from a 14.5 barrel (T/O)? 
Is it safe to draw the conclusion that you are looking for this to operate on the M4 or M16 only?   It would be helpful to know if there are any other weapon platforms you intend to use the MFAD device on, so that we can make sure what we would be proposing will fit and operate properly with those platforms.

Answer:  The intended weapon platforms are the M4, HK416, and the MP5 series weapon systems

<SUBJECT>99 -- Overt Small Laser Marker (OSLM)
<SOLNBR>OSLM0002
<RESPDATE>062207
<ARCHDATE>07072007
<CONTACT>Richard Boast, Contracting Officer, Phone 813-826-7975, Fax 813-826-7504, Email richard.boast@socom.mil
<DESC>Background

This is a market survey to locate potential sources for the development of an Overt Small Laser Marker (OSLM).  The United States Special Operations (USSOCOM) is researching the use of a light and compact laser marker system to mark targets for Laser Spot Track (LST) capable aircraft.  

Combat operations require Fire Support elements to be able to mark targets for LST capable aircraft from MOUNT and rural environments.  This laser marker must be light and compact enough for soldiers to carry on helicopter assaults and foot movements.  Reducing the size and weight of Fire Support equipment (e.g. Laser Target Designators (LTDs), Radios, Infrared (IR) pointers, etc.) is critical to ensure soldiers are able to carry vital equipment during all possible infiltration/exfiltration options.  These factors will reduce soldier fatigue, provide accurate target mark/identification (ID) in order to accurately engage enemy targets and ensure mission success. The tasks proposed by the customer in this Request for Information (RFI) shall provide for specifications of the (OSLM) for use in developmental and operational testing.  

This RFI is to assist the Government in determining the extent and capabilities of existing technology to meet the requirements of the OSLM.  The Government places emphasis on the proposed system?s size, light weight, and its ability to achieve the stated requirements.   The Government anticipates a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) to be published in 1QFY08 based on the outcome of this RFI. 

The Government requests respondees provide a plan to achieve the Threshold/Objective (T/O) requirements in a concise manner which shall consist of no greater than 10 pages and be composed in Times New Roman 12 pt font.  The Government requests that the offeror?s intended plan include a Schedule and Compliance Matrix detailing the plan?s compliance to stated specifications.  Moreover, it is requested the respondees provide information specifically addressing those items/specifications that can not be achieved during this effort.  The intended plan shall also include an estimated cost which shall consist of all design, development, non-recurring engineering and production costs for 2 prototype units which shall be used for testing and operational evaluation by the user.  Additionally, respondees shall submit a proposed production plan to meet fabrication requirements of the current customer?s Basis of Issue Plan (BOIP) of approximately 10 systems.

Required Specifications

The United States Special Operations Command has identified the following required specifications of the prototype OSLM system.
1.	The OSLM shall meet the following size specifications: 
a.	Length: Not to exceed 12 inches (T), 7 inches (O)

5.	The OSLM shall have a manual override for over-heating (T/O)

6.	OSLM Power Source:  The internal power source for the OSLM shall be CR123 or AA with the ability to be connected to a BA 5590 or BA 5557 for longer duration lasing (T/O).  New lightweight battery technology used to reduce overall weight of the system as well as increasing the length of laser bursts will be sought and tested (O).

7.	The OSLM shall have the ability to be mounted to a tri-pod system for terminal guidance operations (T/O).

8.	The laser display shall be easily visible to the operator with the ability to adjust the brightness and display of the following, at a minimum:
a.	Internal Battery Life (T/O)
b.	PRF Code (T/O)
c.	Overheat/Time for Cool Down (T/O)

9.	The OSLM shall have a safety switch for on/off that is similar to the safety for a pistol (T/O).

10.	The OSLM shall include a holster that can be worn on the leg or detached to be fixed on a Modular Lightweight Load-carrying Equipment (MOLLE)-type vest (T/O).

11.	The OSLM shall allow for quick boresighting in the field with the SEE Spot III (T/O).  This may include a removable rail that allows the system to be mounted on the SEE Spot III.

12.	The OSLM shall include field bore sighting targets (T/)

13.	All laser output power data shall be provided in milliWatts (mW) (T/O)

Performance Requirements

The United States Special Operations Command has identified the following performance requirements for OSLM system:

1.	The OSLM power output shall be sufficient for aircraft using advanced targeting pods to acquire the spot at 8,000 ft AGL (T) / 25,000 ft AGL (O) using aircraft specific standoff during all environment conditions.
2.	The OSLM shall be able to mark a target, with the aircraft able to acquire, at a range to target of 1,500 meters (T) / 5,000 meters (O).
3.	The beam divergence of the system shall be 0.5 mrad (T), 0.25 mrad (O).
4.	The OSLM shall mark targets for laser spot capable aircraft (T) and conduct terminal guidance operations for laser guided munitions (O).
5.	The OSLM shall have a fixed sighting system (T/O). This sighting system should work like common fixed sights on a pistol.
6.	The OSLM?s internal power source will operate (insertion and extraction) like a pistol magazine (T/O) and include three of these ?magazines? per system.  

This announcement is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP).  There is no solicitation available at this time. This notice is published for information purposes only and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. The Government will not pay for information received as a result of this announcement.

Questions of a technical nature shall be directed to the cognizant Technical Point of
Contact, as specified below:

Question:  Internal Battery Life (T/O):   Is LED okay to indicate low battery condition?  

Answer:  Yes, as long as its indicated.  We have no set preference at this time.

Question: PRF Code (T/O)  What is the format for displaying the code?  
If the full PRF code set is supported, is it acceptable to use the control as the display?  Can the control be protected and accessed by a waterproof cover?  

Answer:  The last 3 numbers for the code are all that is required.  The first number on all codes is 1 so that does not need to be displayed.  As long as the user can see the code he is firing on any format is acceptable.  The placement of the code should obviously be in the rear so when the user is looking down the sights he can verify the code did not change during infill.  A waterproof cover is fine as long as it is see through.  In fact to ensure it meets the requirement of waterproof you will more than likely have to do this.

Question:  Overheat/Time for Cool Down (T/O)
Is LED okay to indicate overheat condition?  

Answer:  As long as its easily recognizable, any format is acceptable at this time.  Once proto-types are reviewed, this might change to the "best" solution but presently, there is no firm requirement in this area.  The Government is reviewing what industry produces and seeks to not restrict creativity while meeting the requirement.

Question: The OSLM shall have a safety switch for on/off that is similar to the safety for a pistol (T/O). 
Does a mechanical spring loaded cover satisfy the requirement?  

Answer:  The Government prefers it to work exactly like a pistol safety (1911).  In this fashion, the user relys on muscle memory during conflict and without having to think about or consider additional steps.   

Question: The OSLM shall include field bore sighting targets (T/)  
Please provide more detailed description for this requirement.  

Answer:  The laser and its sight will more than likely be a parallel bore, meaning they will never actually cross at any point.  This will require us to have a way to verify, in the field, that the laser is still sighted correctly.  That will mean a target set at a certain distance that has a dot for you to put your sight on and a dot your laser should hit to ensure you are "zeroed".  If they do not line up you know you are off and now must either adjust or compensate.

Question: The OSLM shall have a fixed sighting system (T/O). 
This sighting system should work like common fixed sights on a pistol.  Is there a preferred sight configuration?  Can you provide specific information on this sight?  

Answer:  The sight will look and act exactly like hard sights for a pistol.  This is the back up sight for the system.  Each user will have the ability to add to the top rail what they want as the sight (aim point, holo-sight, ACOG etc...).  There is not currently a preferred sight as of yet.  Prospective offerors can use a variety of pistol sights that would satisfy this requirement.

Question: What are the Laser Safety requirements for this product?   

Answer:  This will most likely be handled with a waiver.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT/REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is seeking to identify businesses, in particular Small Business sources, (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) that can provide the activities  required by the Medicaid Integrity Program provisions in the Deficit Reduction Action.  

Background:

Medicaid was enacted in 1965 as Title XIX of the Social Security Act (hereinafter referred to as the Act).  Title XIX of the Act is a Federal/State entitlement program that pays for medical assistance for certain individuals and families with low incomes and resources.  Medicaid is a cooperative venture jointly funded by the Federal and State governments (including the District of Columbia and the Territories) to assist States in furnishing medical assistance to eligible needy persons.  Medicaid is the largest source of funding for medical and health-related services for America?s poorest people.  

Within broad national guidelines governed by Federal statutes, regulations, and policies, each State: (i) establishes its own eligibility standards, (ii) determines the type, amount, duration, and scope of services, (iii) sets the rate of payment for services, (iv) and administers its own program.  While State participation in Medicaid is voluntary, all States have chosen to participate.  The federal government supports state administration by providing matching funds and establishing general programmatic guidelines.  

In accordance with the statute, the Medicaid program by law is the payer of last resort.  Third party liability (TPL) refers to the legal obligation of third parties to pay all or some of the health care costs of Medicaid services provided under a State Plan.  Examples of third parties are:  private health insurers, employer-sponsored health insurance, Medicare, workers? compensation, liability settlement, medical-support orders, long-term-care insurance, and estate recovery.  Billions of dollars each year are reported by states to CMS as Medicaid savings attributed to third party liability activities.  These programs are complex and include activities associated with the eligibility-determination process, claims-payment system, and reimbursement methodologies developed by state Medicaid programs.  The TPL policies and procedures are governed by both federal and state laws.

Section 6034 of the Deficit Reduction Act (DRA) of 2005, signed February 8, 2006, established the Medicaid Integrity Program (MIP).  Under this contract, MIP functions are to be performed by the MIC.  The integrity program offers a unique opportunity to identify, recover, and prevent overpayments.  It will also support the efforts of State Medicaid agencies through a combination of oversight and technical assistance.  While CMS has a wealth of experience in the financial management of the Medicaid program, the auditing of those who provide direct services to Medicaid beneficiaries has always been the responsibility of the States.  The DRA defines four main objectives of Medicaid integrity as follows: 

(i)	Review of the actions of individuals or entities furnishing items or services for fraud, waste or abuse;

(ii)	Audit of claims for payment for items or services furnished, or administrative services rendered;

(iii)	Identification of overpayments to individuals or entities receiving Federal funds under this title; and,

(iv)	Education of providers of services, managed care entities, beneficiaries, and other individuals with respect to payment integrity and quality of care.

Please note, this sources sought notice refers only to the review of the actions of individuals or entities furnishing items or services for fraud, waste or abuse.


THIS IS STRICTLY MARKET RESEARCH.  THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE & MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS) WILL NOT ENTERTAIN QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS MARKET RESEARCH. 


Based on the market research, CMS anticipates soliciting for multiple award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts with the following activities to be performed:

A.  Review the actions of individuals or entities furnishing items or services (whether on a fee-for-service, risk or other basis) for which payment may be made under the State plan approved under Title XIX (or under any waiver of such plan approved under section 1115) to determine whether fraud, waste, or abuse has occurred, or is likely to occur; and to determine if  such actions have any potential for resulting in an expenditure of funds under Title XIX in a manner which is not intended under the provisions of Title XIX.


B.  Conduct data mining analysis and perform risk assessment of 
	Medicaid data including, but not limited to, claims for payment under a State plan under Title XIX;


C.  Propose or develop (only one contractor from the IDIQ will be selected to perform this function) a data mining tool and support testing of the tool.  The data mining tool will be used by the Medicaid Integrity Contractors (MIC) to analyze claims data;

D.  The contractor shall provide a data-mining tool that uses Medicaid data to develop a discreet neural network model combined with Medicaid specific business rules to dynamically identify payments at the greatest risk of being fraudulent or inappropriate.

E.  The contractor shall provide an evaluative risk assessment tool that, upon demand, provides a risk assessment of any provider at any location within the Medicaid system. The risk based assessment tool will provide, on demand, a report card on the status of the internal controls of the Medicaid program.  At a minimum, the risk assessment tool shall identify high risk/problem areas of providers. 

F.  The contractor shall conduct simulations of the neural network model and the business rules in real world conditions and provide enhancements as new data and technology becomes available. 

G.  The contractor shall provide training materials and a training plan for Medicaid use of the data mining and risk assessment tools.

Stewart, GA; Gowen Field, ID; and Schofield Barracks, HI.  However, if a large mobilization troop surge occurs, the RC-MRP network must be capable of expanding to any one of 21 additional mobilization platforms.

<DESC>The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) is seeking information from potential sources to support the Agency's need to acquire Vision Testing Services for key Agency positions.  Based on the feedback received from this solicitation, NGA plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) which will delineate the selected acquisition strategy.  This is an inquiry for informational purposes only.  This is not a solicitation for proposals.    The contractor must be able to perform the requirement as outlined in the Vision Assessment Guidelines (Tasks 19 and 20) for Selected NGA Work Roles.  These physician's manuals, dated May 2006, coupled with the NGA Vision Testing Statement of Work (SOW), form the basis of the compulsory skills needed to perform the targeted requirement (these reference documents can be found on FEDTEDS).  The targeted NAICS codes for this effort are 621320 and 621111.  We are considering several contract types including firm-fixed price and time and materials, however, any input into other approaches is welcomed.  The period of performance is for one year beginning October 1, 2007 with estimated one-year options to year 2010.   This work will be performed throughout the continental U.S., although support may be extended globally.   Please identify your business as a Large Business, Small Business or 8(a) certified, if applicable.  Interested sources shall demonstrate their abilities in accordance with the corresponding SOW and applicable physician's manuals.  Responses are to be submitted electronically by 12:00 p.m. on June 22, 2007.    All submissions and questions are to be submitted to the contract specialist identified below.



Vision Testing Questions for RFI



As the contractor:

1.	The targeted NAICS codes for this requirement are 621320 
        and 621111 with a size standard of $6.5M. Would your  
        company be considered a small business by this size 
        standard? 
2.	Do you currently hold a GSA schedule, and if so, what labor 
        categories within the schedule would be utilized for this 
        requirement?  
3.	What experience do you have providing similar types of 
        services?  Was your company the sole provider of the 
        services or an integrator?  If you were an integrator how 
        many sub-contractors did you manage?
4.	How would the requirement be met for vision testing of 
        applicants in the U.S.?
5.	Since the tests may occur anywhere throughout the United 
        States, would it be easier to segregate the requirement by 
        geographical regions?  If so, do you have any suggestions 
        on we should define the regions?  If so, can you price each 
        of the required tests by regions?
6.	There is a slight possibility that tests may be required 
        OCONUS.   Given the requirements, would this require 
        additional turnaround time for the results?
7.	We are looking at the possibility of pricing each of the  
        tests on a firm fixed price basis.  Is this possible?  If 
        not, how would you recommend we structure the pricing -  by  
        test, by region?  If firm fixed price is not recommended, 
        what pricing arrangement would you propose for the MRO, 
        coordinator and for the individual tests?  Cost 
        reimbursable? Time and Materials?
8.	Do you currently have someone available that meets the 
        requirements of a Medical Review Officer (MRO)?  If not, 
        how would your company meet this requirement?
9.	Because of the unknowns of when and where the services will 
        be required, would a Blanket Purchase Agreement be 
        appropriate?
10.	NGA requires a two-week turnaround for reported results, is 
        this reasonable?
11.	Would your company be able to price this effort for more 
        than one year?  If so, how many years would you recommend?

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with High Precision Devices (HPD), 1668 Valtec Lane, Suite C, Boulder, CO  80301, for purchase of a square vacuum jacket, inner structures, radiation shields, and mechanical parts necessary to convert an adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator (ADR) presently at NIST from cooling by liquid cryogens to cooling by a mechanical cryocooler.  The work will include modification of an existing ADR to convert it to a compact U design, and assembly of mechanical parts and existing ADR and a pulse tube cryocooler.

Sole Source determination is based on NIST's requirement for an ADR that is a duplicate of two existing units at NIST.  High Precision Devices is the only vendor that offers an ADR that meets our design specifications. Specifically, no other vendor can meet the NIST requirement for an adiabatic demagnetization unit with (1) a square footprint, (2) that is compatible with NIST's existing nested magnetic shielding for the cold sample box, (3) that is compatible with NIST's existing stripline cable harnesses, feedthrus, and tower electronics, and (4) that is compatible with NIST's existing 50 mK and 4 K electronics and circuit boards.

Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Boulder, CO, and is required within 90 days after receipt of order.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 332710, and the size standard is 500 employees.

This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100K). This synopsis is issued for information only. No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by June 29, 2007, in making the final sole source determination. 

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Any questions regarding this notice shall be submitted in writing to the contracting officer either by e-mail (Brenda.S.Summers@noaa.gov) or fax. (303-497-3163) no later than close of business June 30, 2007. Anticipated award date is July 2, 2007.

Next Generation of Tactical Environmental Clothing (NGTEC)

Description
The 77th Aeronautical Systems Group (77 AESG), seeks sources from industry with the capabilities to perform research and development to improve the Austere Environment Undergarments (AEU) and the Wet and Windy Weather System (W3S).  In addition, the 77 AESG seeks sources from industry for the research and development of a Tactical Operations Glove (TOG) designed to eliminate the need to carry various different gloves and provide additional protection to the Battlefield Airmen.  The scope of this effort shall be to develop materials with integrated protection from environmental conditions, flame and incendiary weapons, and chemical and biological exposure.  Currently issued environmental clothing and protection is environment specific, with limited adaptability.  New technology in this area should be integrated into the Special Operations Forces (SOF) clothing and gear.  Fielded systems should be man-portable with personal, environmental, camouflage, concealment, and deception (CCD), and support gear integrated together into one individual system.  AEU improvements should additionally incorporate new design changes determined by the AFSOC Battlefield Airman.  The AEUs should allow for body heat, cold, and moisture exchange (breathe) as well as be lightweight so as not to significantly increase the individual's physical workload or make noise during movement.  The new AEUs should additionally have an improved flame retardant capibility.  W3S next generation improvements should be more fire resistance and provide a limited protection against chemical, biological and toxic industrial materials (TIM).  TOG should be designed to eliminate the need to carry various different gloves and provide additional protection from fire, limited chemical and biological agents and TIM.  This RFI requires compliance to the Barry Amendment.

Numbered Note 27 applies to this RFI.

Place of Performance will be at the contractor's facility.  Deliverables are to be sent to the HQ AFSOC/A5TS office.  Period of Performance will be 18 months after contract award.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS) TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE.

Evaluation of Medicare Part D Organizations
Customer Service Call Centers and Pharmacy Call Center Contractor

INTRODUCTION
This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis in support of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), Center for Beneficiary Choices (CBC).  CMS is seeking capability statements from small and minority business firms (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) that are qualified to support CMS in evaluating Medicare Part D prescription drug plan contractors? availability and responsiveness to their enrollees and contracted pharmacy providers in providing requested information over the telephone.  

Offerors should note that this is not primarily an Information Technology (IT) action.  IT tasks and requirements performed under this SOW are incidental.  The primary focus of this call center evaluation is on: (1) designing a statistical/scientific approach for sampling Part D Sponsors? beneficiary and pharmacy call centers within a CMS defined accuracy level (calculation of average hold time with an error margin of ?10 seconds); (2) utilizing live telephone interviewers with computer assisted telephone interface systems to make survey calls to beneficiary and pharmacy call centers to determine hold time and disconnection rates; and (3) providing reports and research datasets to CMS based on data collected from surveillance calls.

The Medicare prescription drug benefit, which started January 1, 2006, is provided by stand-alone Medicare Prescription Drug Plans (PDPs) that have contracted with CMS to provide only Part D benefits and by Medicare Advantage plans (MA-PDs) which offer combined Medicare Part A/B benefits along with Part D prescription drug benefits. The organizations that provide Part D benefits are required to meet certain standards for providing information to their enrollees and contracted providers.  An integral part of these requirements is that each organization be responsive when enrollees and providers call on the telephone for information.  Providing timely information is often critical for doctors and pharmacists to help provide Part D enrollees with the prescriptions they need.  In the 2007 contract year, there are currently a total of 552 stand-alone Prescription Drug Plan and Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug plan contracts being surveyed by CMS and these contracts operate a total of 414 beneficiary phone lines and 171 pharmacy help lines.
  

TASK DESCRIPTION
Tasks under this contract will focus primarily on developing a surveillance research protocol, making survey calls to Part D sponsors? beneficiary and pharmacy call centers, and providing reports and data files to CMS based on the findings.  More specifically, offerors will be required to demonstrate that they have extensive and successful experience in providing a full-range of key activities conducting health services research using statistical sampling and operating/managing an outbound call center.  These tasks include:

A.  Study Protocol for Call Center Surveillance: The contractor shall develop a written research protocol which describes their process for completing calls to Part D sponsors? beneficiary
call centers and pharmacy technical support call centers, including when various timestamps will occur during a call to determine the call hold time.  Note: this must include protocols for navigating lines which utilize interactive voice recognition (IVR) or other automated answering systems.  The contractor shall also determine the number of calls required to be placed to each Part D sponsor?s beneficiary call center and to their pharmacy technical support call center on a weekly basis to ensure an accuracy level for calculation of average hold time with an error margin of ?10 seconds, accounting for the number of beneficiaries enrolled in plans offered by the sponsor.  CMS estimates that during survey weeks, the total number of calls should be approximately 7,500 to 10,000 per week for the beneficiary lines and 4,000 to 6,000 per week for the pharmacy lines.

B.  Pilot Survey of Call Centers:  The contractor shall conduct a 1-week pilot survey of Part D sponsors? beneficiary call centers and their pharmacy technical support call centers using their CMS approved protocol.  At the discretion of CMS, a second pilot week may be required based on findings from the first week pilot.

C.  Analysis of Call Center Pilot Survey Data:  The contractor shall provide a report to CMS which includes an analysis of all data obtained from the call center pilot survey and shall also supply CMS with call-level raw data files from the pilot survey upon request.  Additionally, the contractor shall compare pilot survey findings to Part D sponsors? actual call data, both at the summary level and individual call level.

D.  Survey of Call Centers:  Once revisions are made to the research protocol following input from the pilot survey and CMS provides final approval, the contractor shall begin surveying Part D sponsors? beneficiary call centers and their pharmacy technical support call centers.  The contractor will complete the proposed number of calls to every Part D organization?s customer service line and pharmacy help line over the course of a one-week period (5 business days) as specified in their CMS approved protocol.  The contractor will repeat this same calling process for all Part D organizations, but with the Part D organizations re-ordered in the call schedule to ensure that the same organizations are not called on the same days / times as the prior week.  The contractor will continue this process for a minimum of 4 weeks per calendar quarter (specific weeks to be surveyed each quarter will be specified by CMS) and at additional times as specified by CMS, until the end of the contract period.

E.  Analysis of Weekly Call Center Survey Data:  For each organization called, the contractor shall report on the results of the inquiries.  The call center contract summary reports shall include current week, quarter-to-date, and year-to-date statistics for each contract?s beneficiary call center and pharmacy call center.  These reports shall contain the organization contract number, organization name, range of call dates, Part D sponsor type (e.g. PDP or MA-PD, or code to represent), Call center type (beneficiary or pharmacy), total number of call made to the organization, number of successful calls, number of unsuccessful calls, average IVR time, average hold time, minimum time to answer, median time to answer, maximum time to answer, percent of disconnected calls, percent of calls with a hold time of 30 seconds or less, and other information relevant to assessing performance as specified by CMS.  In addition, a second report shall be provided that describes for each contract the reasons for unsuccessful calls, and the count of calls associated with each of these reasons for the current survey week.  

F.  Call Center Call-Level Datasets: The contractor will supply CMS with an electronic file in SAS dataset file format (.sas7bdat) containing the call level data for each of the calls that were dialed to each organization?s beneficiary call centers and pharmacy technical support call centers for each week of call surveillance.

<DESC>Sources Sought and Preliminary Site Visit Announcement.  The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) seeks on-call technical assistance and maintenance support on a 24/7/365 basis from a vendor with certified Alcatel technicians to provide support for the existing MCC Alcatel VoIP telephone system.  The Alcatel telephone system installed at MCC supports 450 employees and other staff located in the U.S. and internationally.  The Alcatel system was installed in the 2004/2005 timeframe and initially provided digital support but has been upgraded to support voice over IP (VoIP) and SoftPhone.  The primary server, which includes the agency's PRI's, is located in the MCC main headquarters at 875 15th Street, N.W. in Washington D.C. In February 2007, a second location at 1401 H Street, N.W. was designed to provide spatial redundancy for the primary system.  An additional PRI is currently in progress for the secondary site.  The sites are currently connected by a 50MB Ethernet circuit which also acts as a failover route for data.  The system must be kept up to date with the latest manufacturer software/firmware releases as approved by MCC.  Service requirements include 1) Troubleshooting and problem resolution, as needed; 2) Review of all software maintenance releases and a written assessment on their applicability for the MCC; 3) Installation of software/firmware updates as needed; 4) Compliance with and execution of all manufacturers maintenance procedures; 5) Response to major system outages within two hours and minor system outages within twenty-four hours.  Major system outages are defined as the loss of 40% or more of telephones or telephone lines; 6) Assistance to MCC IT staff to address telephone system issues (response time same as minor system outage); 7) Assist MCC IT staff with configuration of additional telephone sets, faxes, and other telephone system equipment as needed; 8) Repair or replace any listed equipment with compatible unit; 9) Documentation of the overall phone system; 10) Development of system failover and recovery documentation; 11) Implementation of call accounting; 12) Identification of system deficiencies; and 13) Integration with the MCC's Active Directory. The contractor shall perform services at the MCC facilities at 875 15th Street, N.W. (Bowen Bldg.) and 1401 H Street, N.W. (City Center), Washington D.C. and at the contractor's facilities.  No office space will be provided at the MCC locations.  The performance period of the contract is estimated from contract award through December 31, 2007.  Options for continued service will be included in the contract.  A site visit is scheduled for Monday, June 25, 2007 at 2:00 p.m. in the MCC City Center facility.  In order to attend the site visit, interested vendors must send an email to Kathy Spainhower at spainhowerk@mcc.gov  not later than 11:00 a.m. on June 21, 2007 to ensure access to the facility.  The email must contain 1) Names of ALL attendees and citizenship; 2) Number of certified Alcatel technicians currently on staff; 3) A capabilities statement.  Approved attendees must arrive between 1:30 and 1:50 p.m. at 875 15th Street, N.W., 2nd Floor Lobby, Washington D.C. to be escorted to the meeting in the City Center facility.  Once a final procurement strategy is determined, a RFQ will be issued.

<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) - Field Acquisition Office in Grand Prairie, Texas, has a future requirement for the provision of Air Charter/Air Ambulance Services to be provided to all BOP facilities throughout the contiguous United States, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.  The primary objective of Air Charter/Air Ambulance Services will be to provide air ambulance/flight services to transport individuals confined to the custody of the BOP.  The purpose of publicizing for potential actions is to increase competition, to broaden industry participation in meeting Government requirements, and to assist small businesses in general in obtaining contracts and subcontracts.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a Request for Quotation (RFQ), but instead is a market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources prior to issuing an RFP or RFQ.  THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 481211 and the applicable small business size standard is 1,500 employees.  This Sources Sought Synopsis is for planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  All information submitted in response to this announcement is voluntary; the Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any costs incurred in developing information provided to the Government.  A draft Statement of Work (SOW) has been posted along with this Sources Sought Synopsis to provide a more detailed description of the requirement, and for any industry comments.  The SOW is still a work-in-progress, and is NOT the final version.  Based upon the market research, the Government will make a determination whether or not to issue an unrestricted solicitation; however it reserves the right to make this a small business set-aside based on the interest and technical capabilities received from small business concerns.  (Under an unrestricted solicitation, large businesses will be required to submit a subcontracting plan.)  Hard copies of the Market Research Questionnaire (MRQ) will not be available.  The MRQ and SOW will be available on or about June 15, 2007, and will be distributed solely through the General Services Administrations Federal Business Opportunities website at www.fedbizopps.gov.  The website provides all downloading instructions to obtain a copy of the MRQ and related documents.  Responses to the MRQ are due no later than 4:00 p.m. local time, July 2, 2007, and shall be electronically submitted to Lincoln Strunk, Contracting Officer at sstrunk@bop.gov or via facsimile at (972) 352-4545.

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service is issuing a Request for Information (RFI) for a robust Advanced Function Presentation (AFP) toolset that meets U.S. Government Section 508 compliance standards (Visually Impaired/Blind Accessibility).  This product needs to be fully Section 508 compliant or detailed information must be provided specifying all aspects of non-compliance and targeted scheduled for compliance. The IRS requires that all interested vendors address how their product meets or will meet the appropriate technical standards listed under Section 508 Standards, under 508 Law found at www.Section508.gov.  

Technical Requirements:

The Internal Revenue Service has begun a multi-year effort to migrate taxpayer notice composition and certain pre-print processes to a UNIX platform.  To accommodate the need for developers on the new environment to manipulate AFP output and compare AFP output to legacy AFP output, we are evaluating products to meet our technical needs and also meet accessibility needs within our employee community.

The following list provides a high-level list and explanation of processing requirements we are looking to meet through commercial off the shelf (COTS) solutions.  We are looking for a single source, fully integrated solution.

1.	Batch mode high speed binary print comparison
2.	Batch mode AFP file sorts and merges
3.	Batch mode transforms to PDF
4.	Page and document level manipulation (splitting, resequencing, rotation, deletions, etc.)
5.	AFP Indexing (TLE creation and manipulation)
6.	AFP Viewing

1.	Batch mode high speed binary print comparison,
	Below is a detailed explanation of each requirement: 
a.	Run on Sun Solaris version 9.x or later.  
b.	Provide masking capabilities at the individual field, page, and document level to allow comparison of files with the ability for the user to exclude reporting on known differences.  For example, reference and test files being compared could be composed using different fonts (Arial versus Helvetica), different font types (outline versus raster), different font sizes (12 point versus 8 point),  or the reference file could contain a graphic image on the first page of each notice,  while the test file does not contain the graphic image.  We require the ability to exclude known differences from the reporting. 
c.	Provide a method of synchronizing files, so that if the reference file and the test file contain differing numbers of records, they can be compared with an indication of which records occurred only on one file.
d.	Compare files with differing internal structures (MO:DCA print streams).  This could be due to different structured fields or different MO:DCA triplets within a structured field.  For example, the reference file contains a page segment referred to in an Include Page Segment (IPS) structured field.  In addition, for the reference file, the page segment is also mapped with a Map Page Segment (MPS) structured field in the active environment group for that page.  The test file contains the same page segment referred to in an Include Page Segment (IPS) structured field, but in the test file, the page segment is not mapped with an MPS structured field.  The printed output looks identical.  We need to know that the rendered output is identical.  (See requirement six below for non-printable fields).  Please see the IBM document number SG31-6802-07 Data Streams and Object Architecture Mixed Object Document Content Architecture Reference for information on MO:DCA.
e.	Compare print files with different encoding schemes (ASCII, EBCDIC, UNICODE UTF-8 and UTF-16, big-endian and little-endian byte ordering) performing the appropriate translations so files produced on different platforms can be accurately compared. For example a reference file is created on z/OS with EBCDIC encoding with big-endian byte ordering, and the test file is created on a Sun Solaris 64-bit system with UTF-16LE.
f.	If Tag Logical Elements (TLEs) are present in the print files being compared, identify and report differences.
g.	Compare AFP files generated with the same or different composition tools on the same or different hosts (z/OS and/or Solaris).  The table below summarizes possible combinations.
 
Benchmark AFP File created on:	Newly Composed AFP File created on: 
z/OS 	z/OS 
Solaris 	Solaris
z/OS 	Solaris
Solaris	z/OS

2.	Batch mode AFP file sorts and merges
	Below is a detailed explanation of each requirement: 
a.	Run on Sun Solaris version 9.x or later.
b.	Maintain font, graphics, TLE and white space integrity.
c.	Provide high performance single and multi-element sorts and/or merges.
d.	Provide capability for multi-file input and multi-file output, based upon selection criteria.  
e.	Comply with open scalable architecture (J2EE, JAVA)

3.	Batch mode transforms to PDF
Below is a detailed explanation of each requirement: 
a.	Run on Sun Solaris version 9.x or later.
b.	Maintain font, graphics, and white space integrity.
c.	Accurately produce PDF output files from AFP input files.
d.	Provide capability to convert select AFP pages or documents based on highly configurable criteria to PDF output.
e.	Provide support for Double-Byte Character Set (DBCS).
 
4.	Page and document level manipulation (splitting, resequencing, rotation, deletions, etc.)
Below is a detailed explanation of each requirement: 
a.	Run on Sun Solaris version 9.x or later.
b.	Allow for high-speed batch operation of these functions.
c.	Provide page and document level rotation (180) and within-document page resequencing (Z-to-A) for AFP documents and files.
d.	Provide AFP file splitting at the document level, based on variable criteria.
e.	Maintain font, graphics, TLE and white space integrity.

5.	AFP Indexing (TLE creation and manipulation)
Below is an explanation of each requirement: 
a.	Run on Sun Solaris version 9.x or later.
b.	Allow for high-speed batch operation of these functions.
c.	Provide configurable creation and manipulation of TLEs.
d.	Provide configurable creation of TLEs based on AFP page or document content.
e.	Maintain font, graphics, TLE and white space integrity.

6.	AFP Viewing
Below is an explanation of each requirement: 
a.	Run on Windows XP or later.
b.	Provide WYSIWYG viewing for AFP documents with inline or external resources (fonts, images, and indexes), including support for AFP outline fonts, graphics, standard barcode types, and TLEs.
c.	Provide capabilities to determine which AFP resources are used in a document, to include copy groups, fonts, and graphics.
d.	Be able to dynamically remap Windows fonts.
e.	View individual overlays and page segments.
f.	Search across documents based on text strings, document content or index values.
g.	Select ranges of pages, ranges of documents or entire files for local printing or for conversion to PDF.
h.	Provide Section 508 compliance.


Statement of Need:

The purpose of this RFI is to determine if any vendors offer an integrated, robust Advanced Function Presentation (AFP) toolset that meets the technical requirements listed above and meets U.S. Government Section 508 compliance standards (Visually Impaired/Blind Accessibility).

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT/REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is seeking to identify businesses, in particular Small Business sources, (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) that can provide the activities  required by the Medicaid Integrity Program provisions in the Deficit Reduction Action.  

Background:

Medicaid was enacted in 1965 as Title XIX of the Social Security Act (hereinafter referred to as the Act).  Title XIX of the Act is a Federal/State entitlement program that pays for medical assistance for certain individuals and families with low incomes and resources.  Medicaid is a cooperative venture jointly funded by the Federal and State governments (including the District of Columbia and the Territories) to assist States in furnishing medical assistance to eligible needy persons.  Medicaid is the largest source of funding for medical and health-related services for America?s poorest people.  

Within broad national guidelines governed by Federal statutes, regulations, and policies, each State: (i) establishes its own eligibility standards, (ii) determines the type, amount, duration, and scope of services, (iii) sets the rate of payment for services, (iv) and administers its own program.  While State participation in Medicaid is voluntary, all States have chosen to participate.  The federal government supports state administration by providing matching funds and establishing general programmatic guidelines.  

In accordance with the statute, the Medicaid program by law is the payer of last resort.  Third party liability (TPL) refers to the legal obligation of third parties to pay all or some of the health care costs of Medicaid services provided under a State Plan.  Examples of third parties are:  private health insurers, employer-sponsored health insurance, Medicare, workers? compensation, liability settlement, medical-support orders, long-term-care insurance, and estate recovery.  Billions of dollars each year are reported by states to CMS as Medicaid savings attributed to third party liability activities.  These programs are complex and include activities associated with the eligibility-determination process, claims-payment system, and reimbursement methodologies developed by state Medicaid programs.  The TPL policies and procedures are governed by both federal and state laws.

Section 6034 of the Deficit Reduction Act (DRA) of 2005, signed February 8, 2006, established the Medicaid Integrity Program (MIP).  Under this contract, MIP functions are to be performed by the MIC.  The integrity program offers a unique opportunity to identify, recover, and prevent overpayments.  It will also support the efforts of State Medicaid agencies through a combination of oversight and technical assistance.  While CMS has a wealth of experience in the financial management of the Medicaid program, the auditing of those who provide direct services to Medicaid beneficiaries has always been the responsibility of the States.  The DRA defines four main objectives of Medicaid integrity as follows: 

(i)	Review of the actions of individuals or entities furnishing items or services for fraud, waste or abuse;

(ii)	Audit of claims for payment for items or services furnished, or administrative services rendered;

(iii)	Identification of overpayments to individuals or entities receiving Federal funds under this title; and,

(iv)	Education of providers of services, managed care entities, beneficiaries, and other individuals with respect to payment integrity and quality of care.

Please note, this sources sought notice refers only to the review of the actions of individuals or entities furnishing items or services for fraud, waste or abuse.


THIS IS STRICTLY MARKET RESEARCH.  THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE & MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS) WILL NOT ENTERTAIN QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS MARKET RESEARCH. 


Based on the market research, CMS anticipates soliciting for multiple award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts with the following activities to be performed:

A.  Review the actions of individuals or entities furnishing items or services (whether on a fee-for-service, risk or other basis) for which payment may be made under the State plan approved under Title XIX (or under any waiver of such plan approved under section 1115) to determine whether fraud, waste, or abuse has occurred, or is likely to occur; and to determine if  such actions have any potential for resulting in an expenditure of funds under Title XIX in a manner which is not intended under the provisions of Title XIX.


B.  Conduct data mining analysis and perform risk assessment of 
	Medicaid data including, but not limited to, claims for payment under a State plan under Title XIX;


C.  Propose or develop (only one contractor from the IDIQ will be selected to perform this function) a data mining tool and support testing of the tool.  The data mining tool will be used by the Medicaid Integrity Contractors (MIC) to analyze claims data;

D.  The contractor shall provide a data-mining tool that uses Medicaid data to develop a discreet neural network model combined with Medicaid specific business rules to dynamically identify payments at the greatest risk of being fraudulent or inappropriate.

E.  The contractor shall provide an evaluative risk assessment tool that, upon demand, provides a risk assessment of any provider at any location within the Medicaid system. The risk based assessment tool will provide, on demand, a report card on the status of the internal controls of the Medicaid program.  At a minimum, the risk assessment tool shall identify high risk/problem areas of providers. 

F.  The contractor shall conduct simulations of the neural network model and the business rules in real world conditions and provide enhancements as new data and technology becomes available. 

G.  The contractor shall provide training materials and a training plan for Medicaid use of the data mining and risk assessment tools. 
CMS requests capability statements, not to exceed 10 pages, to this Sources Sought/RFI from particularly Small Businesses.  At a minimum, your capability statement shall include the following information:

1.  Business Information:

a.	DUNS:

e.	Company Point of Contact, Phone and E-mail address of individuals who can verify the capabilities/experience identified in the responses.



2.  The contractor(s) shall be familiar with and use of the Government Auditing Standards, commonly known as the Yellow Book, and audit work paper documentation.


3.  Please identify key personnel and a sampling of their education and experience that will be able to perform the functions identified in A through G above.  

4.  Please provide a statement of the experience and capability of your company with regard to performing the Medicaid activities described above as well as your knowledge and understanding of Title XIX of the Social Security Act and Section 6034 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005.

<DESC>VISN 12 (Chicago, North Chicago and Hines, IL; Tomah, Milwaukee, and Madison, WI; and Iron Mountain MI) have experienced one of the highest numbers of returnees from OIF/OEF in the country.  A minority of the 14,500 returnees have been screened and/or have used VA services thus far.  In order to make sure that OIF/OEF returnees are aware of their needs for services and the availability of a wide variety of VA services, these returning warriors need to be contacted, screened, and educated regarding how to take advantage of education, treatment, and benefits.  About 15% of current users of VISN 12 medical services receive mental health (MH) and substance abuse care.  All estimates suggest that at least twice that many could benefit from care for such conditions.  However, many do not seek care for MH problems due to stigma, inconvenience, and other barriers.  Previous studies in VISN 12 suggest that at least twice as many older veterans would use MH and addiction services if those services were provided in primary care and it is estimated even more would use telephone-delivered services.  The contractor would provide 24 hours per day, seven days a week service for 36 months.  The contractor will make telephonic contact with the OEF/OIF veterans and introduce the program of services that are available and encourage enrollment.  All enrollees will then be contacted by the contractor's experienced behavioral health clinicians for screening and assessment in the areas of PTSD, anxiety disorders, alcohol/substance abuse, etc.  If additional chronic medical conditions are identified, the veteran will be enrolled in a program where the primary care practitioner will handle MH problems.  Having this available to pts and staff telephonically will obviate the need for the alternative, expensive collocation model of integrated care.  Mission statement: The seamless transition of OIF/OEF veterans into VA care and the integration of mental health into primary care are major components of VA's mental health strategic plan and VHA's overall plan for health care. The VA's expectation is for 5,000 veterans to be enrolled for MH services by 9/30/07.

<CONTACT>Gregory K. Johnson, (309) 782-5851
<DESC>The United States Government is looking for sources that can provide a moving target that replicates a passenger vehicle/truck approaching an entry or check point. Vehicle speed should be adjustable between 5 and 20 mph. The vehicle must travel along  a straight path (approximately 540 feet in length) before entering a serpentine section (approximately 160 feet in length) and navigating around Jersey barriers, making a right-left-right (45 degree turns preferred) on a gravel base that is 35 feet wide. Jersey barriers (K-rails or traffic dividers) which are normally 3 feet high and 20 feet long could possibly be customized to protect vehicle propulsion system but should replicate actual standard barriers to the greatest extent possible. The target mover and any track or cables used to control its movement must be protected from firing. Sketches of the vehicle target path are available upon request from the POC listed below. The Frontal Movement Target must be a realistic 4-sided target which stays upright  and replicates pickup truck-type vehicle. The vehicle must be RF controlled and battery powered, react to 3 hits by stopping and setting off Battle Effects Simulator (BES), and have 2 Stationary Infantry Targets (SITs) that fall when hit and stop vehicle.  Vehicle targets should be designed for weapons up to .50 calibers. When traveling in the twelve oclock direction, firing on vehicle target could originate from the twelve oclock through nine oclock positions. Interested vendors are asked to provide a s tatement of interest as well as product and capability literature, including pictures where possible, by close of business (COB), 28 June 2007. Responses should be forwarded to Gregg Johnson, Contract Specialist, at Gregory.johnson23@us.army.mil , 309-782- 5851. Responding vendors are also asked to provide their business size when responding to this synopsis. This market survey is not a formal RFP or RFQ and should not be construed as a commitment by the Government to procure or pay for any such supplies or services.

<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) at the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) intends to negotiate with only one source, Micro Motion Inc., 7070 Winchester Circle, Boulder, Colorado  80301 to acquire 12 each Mass Flowmeters.  This action is authorized by and in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.  The Government believes that the only responsible source capable of satisfying the agency's requirement is Micro Motion Inc.

The metering system shall be used to tell the user the exact number of pounds of retardant loaded on the airtanker and shall meet the following criteria:  provide measurement of true mass (lb) of retardant loaded into aircraft rather than volume (gal), to one percent accuracy;  have no parts intrusive into the flow stream;  possess accuracy and applicability not affected by changes in retardant type, viscosity, density, or temperature;  possess accuracy not affected by pulsating flows or changes in flow rate +15 or -50 percent from nominal maximum flow;  be impervious to corrosion and abrasion;  possess excellent repeatability and stability with long term drift of less than 2 percent.  The estimated value of this acquisition is less than $165,000.00.  No Request for Quotation (RFQ) will be issued and no response will be made to letters or telephone requests for a copy of the solicitation.  This is not a request for competitive quotes, but serves as a procurement notice to fulfill public posting requirements in accordance with FAR 5.101(a)(1).  The requirement is unrestricted and the NAICS code 334513 applies.  Responsible firms believing they can provide the required items are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer referencing action item RAQ074007.  However, they must provide convincing evidence that they can furnish the requested items at a cost that will not exceed the total estimated transaction cost.  All responses will be fully considered.  If no affirmative responses are received by July 2, 2007 to the effect that a comparable source exists, an order will be placed with Micro Motion Inc. for the requirement stated here.  Questions concerning this acquisition may be directed to Kathy Colson at 208-387-5545 or faxed to 208-387-5574.

DESCRIPTION:  The 1 meter lens assembly is intended to complement an existing 25 and 50 mm lower performance lenses for an existing pair of FLIR Systems Inc laboratory cameras.  This lens will provide similar, but higher performance, imagery from a test continuity perspective for the Benefield Anechoic Chamber.  These lenses are custom designed to mate to both these cameras directly without optical, mechanical or radiometric modification or adjustment to either the cameras or the optics.   The refurbished high speed data recorder is a multi-hard drive very high speed data recorder designed to interface to the two laboratory infrared cameras in our possession.  This recorder supports not only the cameras we have, but more importantly, also supports the advanced thermographic analysis software, unique to FSI.  Therefore, this particular recorder from FSI is the only one that will interface to our existing cameras and software.

It is a RFI to assist the government with its market research.  The Joint Program Manager  Decontamination is conducting a market survey to determine the non-developmental availability of a Contaminated Human Remains Transport System.  This system will consist of two steps, but vendors are invited to provide information on either one or both pr ocesses.

Second, the system must provide a container capable of safely transporting contaminated remains from the decontamination point to the Continental United States for disposition.  Parameters for the handling of remains from point of fatali ty to the MADCP system include:  (1) How long will the system remained sealed and not leak fluids or off-gas vapors after remains have been placed inside? (2) How many times can the system be decontaminated with standard military decontaminants and retain its effectiveness? (3) Has the product been tested for efficacy against any hazardous materials?  Parameters for the transportation of remains from the MADCAP back to the Continental United States include:  (1) How will the system provide for the safe tran sport of all decontaminated remains to a servicing mortuary in CONUS?  (2) Will the system meet UN and IATA standards for transportation of hazardous material?   Please provide a white paper explaining the capabilities of the product and its components.  I nclude supporting documentation as it applies.  In addition to the parameters above, please address the following:  (1) Specify whether the product is designed to handle the transport of remains from the point of incident to the MADCP or the transportation  from MADCP to CONUS (or both);  (2) Cost per system;  (3) Dimensions, including height, width, length, weight;  (4) The weight capacity and internal dimensions of each container;  (5) Transportation requirements for the product;  (6) Power requirements; (7) Results of any pertinent testing;  (8) MSDSs if applicable.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation issued by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 2, Albuquerque, New Mexico for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation No. 201817Q023 is issued as a Request for Quotes.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-27.  The clauses and provisions referenced in this solicitation can be found in full text format at http://www.arnet.gov/far.  This solicitation is 100% Set Aside for Small Business.  The contract type will be firm fixed price.  The associated NAICS Code is 541360 and the small business size standard is $4.5 million.  The Department of Labor Wage Determination that applies to this procurement:  2005-2361, Rev. No. 3, Dated 05/29/2007.  The full text of the above wage determination may be obtained at www.wdol.gov. PROJECT SITE: The Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge, San Antonio, New Mexico (Socorro County), was the site of an extensive fire in May of 2006.  The Marcial Fire consumed approximately 802 acres on the Refuge.  Refuge staff has begun rehabilitation efforts in the area and requires a soil survey and analysis of approximately 300 to 350 acres of this burned area.  The area was standing dead (chemically treated) salt cedar prior to the fire.  Sprouting in the survey area is variable with the majority of the sprouts occurring in the cottonwood forest (approximately 70 acres).  This forest was not completely consumed.  The remainder of the area is very open, with only stumps and skeletons of salt cedar remaining.  A topographic survey has been completed on the project area. Soil conditions in the project area will determine in part the success of subsequent planting, seeding, or water management.  It is therefore necessary to complete a soil inventory prior to plant establishment and water delivery infrastructure.   STATEMEN TOF WORK: SCOPE OF SOIL SURVEY AND DATA COLLECTION OF MARCIAL FIRE AREA The scope of the soil survey and data collection activities includes: a.	Initial assessment of the site. b.	Order 2 soil survey - portion of project a.	Field description and classification of soils c.	Order 1 soil survey - portion of project a.	Field description and classification of soils b.	Laboratory analysis of soil samples d.	Soil Salinity Assessment (EM-38 survey) e.	Report describing the results and significance of findings a.	Presentation of data in terms of suitability for revegetation b.	Map preparation (ARCGIS 9.2 or equivalent) and presentation These studies are technical in nature and need to be conducted by professionals who can document a high degree of competence in the field of soil science.  Significant decisions will be based upon this study, and it is imperative that the data be technically sound and appropriate to rehabilitation objectives.  A national certification program for soil scientists has been employed for a number of years by the Soil Science Society of America and the American Society of Agronomy.  The Refuge will require any professional who conducts these studies to be a Certified Professional Soil Classifier under the ARCPACS program. Specifications for Soil Survey of  Marcial Fire Area Detailed procedural guidelines for conducting soil surveys of varying levels of intensity are prepared and published by the The United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).  The Bosque del Apache NWR (Refuge) requires an extensive soil survey of areas burned during the Marcial Fire (2006).   Tasks include: The first phase of the project includes initial screening of the area (330 acres).  This phase includes air photo interpretation (photography provided by the Refuge) of predicted soil chemistry based on vegetation, ground-truthing of this predictions, and minimal test holes and soil salinity measurements to confirm conclusions.  This information would be summarized to determine which areas are predicted to have suitable soils for woody riparian plant establishment. The second phase of the project includes an Order 2 survey of those areas not suitable for woody riparian plant establishment.  This survey is expected to cover the majority of the project area.  This survey would follow the protocol established by the National Cooperative Soil Suvey and the NRCS and include: 1.	Soils description to series with inclusions described, general soil texture for each series, a range of soil salinity for each series.   2.	A map showing the series determined present on the project area surveyed to this level. The third phase of the project includes an Order 1 survey of those areas suitable for woody riparian plant establishment.  This survey would follow the protocol established by the National Cooperative Soil Survey and the NRCS and include: 1.	Accurate description and classification of the soils within the area.  This includes detailed soil profile examination, classification and documentation of soils according to the NRCS Soil Taxonomy system.  Properties should be described to a depth of at least 5 feet and should include as a minimum:  (1) soil texture, (2) soil structure, (3) pH, (4) soil salinity and sodicity, (5) estimated available water capacity, (6) estimated permeability, and (7) depth to seasonal water table.  Other site-specific features that might affect revegetation/rehabilitation efforts should be noted as well.  These activities should be done in full accordance with the National Cooperative Soil Survey guidelines. 2.	Soil sample collection:  Sufficient soil samples will be collected for the accurate classification and description of the soils.  At least one soil profile of each soil taxonomic unit will be sampled and analyzed.  Tests will include (1) texture by hydrometer, (2) pH of the soil saturated paste, (3) electrical conductivity of the soil saturation paste extract, (4) sodium adsorption ratio of the soil saturation extract, and (5) calcium carbonate equivalent (surface soil only). 3.	Accurate mapping of soil types in the area.  The base map should be photographic and at a scale of at least 1:12,000.  USGS orthophotographs are suitable for base mapping.  The maps should be digitized into ARCGIS 9.2 or ARCINFO for use in subsequent analyses. 4.	Interpretation of soil types for revegetation suitability.  Suitability criteria will be developed, specific to the area, for revegetation.  These criteria will be developed jointly with the project soil scientist and either Fish and Wildlife Service, Bosque del Apache NWR biology staff.  Each soil map unit will be rated according to these criteria. The fourth phase of the project includes non-intrusive survey of the field soil salinity.  The technology, developed by the U.S. Salinity Laboratory of the U.S.D. A. Agricultural Research Service, uses an instrument called the EM-38.  The EM-38 measures bulk soil conductivity, which can be accurately correlated to soil salinity.  The EM-38 when employed with an accurate GPS system, can quickly establish hundreds of data points in an area at which soil salinity can be characterized in depth increments of .75 meters to 1.5 meters.  These data, when properly interpreted, can indicate the need and quantity of soil leaching and salinity reclamation on a very detailed scale.  When utilized with the properties described in the soil survey, a complete set of soil data information is established to assist the land manager in the selection of appropriate remediation practices. The last phase of the project is report preparation.  A report describing the methods and presenting the results of both the Order 1 soil survey and the EM-38 survey, along with digitized maps, both in electronic and paper form will be submitted to the Refuge (4 copies electronically, 1 hard copy).  The report will include all procedures, including the initial screening process, protocol followed, raw data (as appendices) and analysis.

<DESC>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency intends to award a Time and Material contract for Web and Electronic Publishing System (WEPS) Consulting services.       This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.   This combined synopsis/solicitation is issued as request for Quotation (RFQ).  This will be a 100% small business set-aside utilizing North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541519, with a small business with a revenue value of $23 Mil. Please identify your business size in your response based upon this standard. This requirement is for:

1.1	BACKGROUND

The OCC produces and delivers a wide range of valuable content to internal and external audiences.  A large portion of that content is produced in Portable Document Format (PDF) and MS Word documents and distributed through OCC Web sites.  In addition, content is delivered in the form of CDs, DVDs, and print publications that are sent to OCC staff and customers by surface mail. 

The agency's existing process for producing and distributing its content is based on a print-centric model that is largely manual and reliant on outdated paper-based editorial processes, resulting in the publishing of content not well suited for non-print media such as the Web.  In recent years, the limitations of this print-centric publishing model have come to light.  For example, content on the Web sites, CDs, and DVDs is often out-of-sync, out-of-date, and in some cases obsolete because of the lack of an authoritative content repository and the inability to effectively manage the content life cycle.  While many of the OCC's customers still rely on print publications, they recognize that the most up-to-date information will be on the Web.  OCC's content consumers want to access that information in segments smaller than the monolithic PDF and Word files that are currently provided.  They also want to be assured that the information they are accessing is the most up-to-date and reliable.   

As a result of the OCC's desire to improve the quality of its published content and the efficiency of its publication process, the Agency initiated two separate projects: The Web site of the Future's Web Content Management System Implementation and the E-Publishing Project to improve the life-cycle management, distribution, and presentation of information published by the OCC.   As the requirements were gathered for the individual efforts, it became clear that the projects shared common goals and objectives and that economies of scale in system development could be realized by implementing these systems together.  The projects were thus joined and renamed the Web and Electronic Publishing System (WEPS).

The OCC recently posted a solicitation for a professional and software services firm to assist in identifying and implementing a solution that addresses the following business objectives: 

?	Provide information to OCC bank examiners in a more timely, accessible, searchable and trustworthy format, whether they work online or off-line and increase the integration of needed information into the examination tool-set.

?	Automate current paper-based editorial processes.  

?	Transform the OCC?s print/document centric publishing model into a content centric one that emphasizes repurposing content and publishing to multiple formats both electronic and print.

?	Ensure OCC's customers are able to easily find, access, and consume OCC content.

In order to meet these objectives, the OCC must find a solution that supports the management and delivery of content as collections of chunked information objects that can be:

?	Updated easily and routinely.
?	Delivered quickly through pinpoint searches to examiners working online or off-line.
?	Enhanced with keywords and cross-referenced for more comprehensive search results.
?	Packaged in formats that are user-friendly and quick to download.
?	Constructed into documents, web pages and the like.
?	Presented in a variety of formats.
?	Managed throughout the content lifecycle.

To address the WEPS requirements, the OCC recognizes that significant organizational change, re-engineering of business processes and procedures, and a redesign of the existing websites is required.  The OCC is currently revamping existing processes in anticipation of the forthcoming CMS.  In addition, the team is developing and testing prototypes of new site designs that include revised information architecture and a content architecture that supports the effective presentation of electronic publications and a more topical organization of content on the Web.  The OCC has four websites, two public facing, one Intranet and one extranet.  It is important to note that the CMS will be implemented in support of the new site designs for all sites.  The CMS will automate newly defined business rules to enable improved content functionality.  The existing web sites will not be imported into the CMS. The fourth site, focused on bank customers, is currently under development and will be deployed on June 26th, 2007.

Content is currently being inventoried and a content clean-up activity is underway.  Publications content is also being migrated to XML templates to aid in the future transfer to the CMS.  

1.2	OBJECTIVES  

The purpose of this acquisition is to acquire unbiased and objective advisory and consultative services to assist the OCC in:
1)	The evaluation of Web Content Management System (WCMS) COTS products and capabilities, as well as the corresponding COTS vendors? current standing and planned direction in the WCMS market space. 
2)	A comparison of OCC WCMS needs and requirements versus WCMS solutions that are proposed as part of a separate OCC acquisition. 
3)	A written evaluation of solution design, demonstrations, and user acceptance testing.
4)	Guidance regarding organizational change management within the OCC.
This Statement of Work (SOW) describes the business considerations, objectives, scope, and project deliverables for requested WCMS Consulting Services. 

1.3	SCOPE OF WORK

In order to successfully procure the enterprise web content management component of the WEPS solution, the OCC seeks additional support by a qualified, unbiased Contractor who is considered an expert in the evaluation of Web Content Management Systems (WCMS). This person would serve as an advisor to the OCC and provide objective feedback regarding WCMS products, capabilities, the respective product vendors? current standing, planned direction, and continued viability in the WCMS market space. The advisory Contractor would also compare and evaluate OCC WCMS needs and requirements vis-a-vis the WCMS solutions proposed in the WEPS primary procurement.

The WCMS expert would attend OCC meetings that are part of the procurement of a WCMS. The expert would observe the meetings, provide consultation outside of the meetings and generate a final evaluation/advisory from the meetings. The WCMS expert would also participate in the evaluation of a solution design, solution demonstrations, and solution user acceptance testing. The expert would generate written evaluations from each of the efforts. 

The WCMS expert will be called upon to provide guidance regarding organizational change management within the OCC as a result of the WEPS implementation.

    Section 835 of Public Law 107?296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ?more than 50 percent? for ?at least 80 percent? each place it appears.

is held? 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107?296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107?296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.

(End of provision)

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  
The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ?more than 50 percent? for ?at least 80 percent? each place it appears.

    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107?296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.

    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights.

    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests.

(End of provision)

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  
The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, which is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ); quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12 and the Simplified Acquisition Procedures set forth in FAR Part 13. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for MTS 858 Axial-Torsion System or equivalent. Specifications: This is a brand name or equal procurement for an MTS 858 Axial-Torsion System. The system shall meet or exceed the following salient characteristics:  1. Load frame:  -The unit shall have 3.0 inch diameter columns.  The torsional stiffness is a function of diameter^4 so the column size dictates the torsional stiffness which has an effect on testing results.  This is more important with extended columns. -The standard torque capacity shall be 200 N-m. -The unit shall incorporate a proportional slow turn on manifold with off/low/high pressure control and a proportional slow turn on valve for safety of the operator and specimen. -The unit shall have Pressure & Return accumulators. 2.Hydraulic Pump (HPU): -The HPU shall have a variable displacement, pressure compensating piston pump to ensure flow meets the required demand, yet automatically reduces flow (and operating cost) when demand is low. -The HPU shall operate at no more than 60 db(A) when measured at 3 feet at full pressure, fully compensated. -The HPU shall be able to operate to the noise specification at full output without the need for a pump room or enclosure (for hearing safety reasons). -The HPU motor and pump assembly shall be submerged in the reservoir for complete leak free operation, reduced transmitted noise and minimized thermal gradients across pump mechanisms, in order to increase pump life. -The electric pump motor shall be liquid cooled to increase motor life and efficiency.  The motor should also be capable of operating at an efficiency level of at least 90%. -The HPU shall be as small and portable as possible and should offer reconfiguration capability. 3.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL
ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION
FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-17.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This acquisition is unrestricted and all interested quoters may submit a quote.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), has a requirement for a Telecom Laser with output wavelength within one of the telecom bands (either 1.319 or 1.55 micrometers) for use in experiments involving high-finesse optical cavities incorporating micromechanical mirrors.  The laser will be used to couple into a fixed-length Fabry-Perot cavity whose length may be as small as 10 mm.  The cavity finesse is expected to be in excess of 1000.  The laser must have a linewidth below that of the linewidth of the smallest Fabry-Perot cavity we might want to probe.  It must be able to be tuned to a cavity mode and allow fast frequency control to lock the laser frequency to the cavity mode.  Amplitude noise should be low.

The cavity into which we will couple the laser will have a free spectral range that may be as high as 15 GHz.  Since the cavity will not be tunable, the laser must have a tuning range of at least 15 GHz, with no gaps in tunability over this range.  Since tuning will take place inside a control loop, an electronic tuning input must be available (software tuning alone, or control from a knob, is not adequate).  We expect to have a cavity finesse of at least 1000; thus, the cavity linewidth will be in the vicinity of 15 MHz.  Consequently the laser linewidth must be smaller than 150 kHz and the laser must have fast tuning ability with a range of at least 150 MHz.  Once again, an electronic tuning input must be available (software tuning alone, or control from a knob, is not adequate).

LINE ITEM 0001: Quantity one (1) each Telecom Laser, meeting all of the following required specifications: 

A.	The wavelength shall be 1.319 micrometers or 1.55 micrometers;  
B.	The laser must have a slow tuning range of at least 15 GHz, with no gaps in tunability over this range. Slow tuning is usually accomplished by temperature.  This tuning ability must be in the form of an electronic input;
C.	The laser linewidth must be smaller than 150 kHz;
D.	The laser must have "fast" tuning ability with a range of at least 150 MHz. Fast tuning is usually accomplished by means of a piezoelectric actuator. Again, an electronic input must be provided. The bandwidth of this control must be at least 5 kHz;
E.	Optical power output: Must be a minimum of 40 mW;
F.	The laser output must be linearly polarized and provided by a single-mode, polarization-maintaining fiber.

The Contractor shall state the warranty coverage provided for the equipment.

Please submit all questions in writing to: andrew.perry@nist.gov

Delivery terms shall be FOB Destination. Delivery shall be completed not later than 12 weeks after receipt of order.
		
FOB DESTINATION MEANS: The Contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.

Award will be made to the Contractor whose quote offers the best value to the Government. The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability factor "Meeting or Exceeding the Requirement," 2) and Price.  

Technical Capability shall be more important than price. 

Technical Capability:
Evaluation of Technical Capability will be based on the information provided in the quotation. Quotations shall include the make model of the products, manufacturer sales literature or other product literature, which addresses all specifications and clearly documents that the product offered meets or exceeds the specifications identified herein. 

Price will evaluated for reasonableness. 

Stronger Consideration
Selection of a system that meets the minimum stated requirements will be made on a best-value basis (performance/cost ratio). Under technical capabilities factor, additional consideration will be given for a system that would provide the following
characteristics (listed in order of importance):  
1.	Lower amplitude noise (often called RIN, for Residual Intensity Noise); 
2.	Greater tuning range (Slow);
3.	Greater tuning range (Fast) ;
4.	Smaller linewidth;
5.	Greater optical power.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions.

1) In the USAF Band Audio and Video services for the 60th Anniversary RFP, there is a line that states "The audio and video shall be captured by dedicated trucks to be provided by the USAF."  Please explain.  The vendor needs to provide one if only bidding on one service or two if bidding on both.  Please see question and answer #5 for more details.   

2) It also states that "This production does not require an(d) CG, digital effects, or slo-mo/replay equipment", yet the equipment list asks for an Abekas DVE Dual Twin VDE with CPL control (digital effects) and a LANCE TDC-100 TD Controller and an EVS XT Live Slo-Motion system (slo-mo/replay).  Can any digital effects gear or slo-mo/replay gear be omitted? This gear can be omitted.  Further internal productions meetings have eliminated the need for this gear.  

3)  There are two DSS receivers listed that seem to be used if you were doing a live broadcast, but not for this application.  Is it okay to omit those also? The DSS receivers for the live broadcast can be omitted as long as the DSS receivers are used only for transmitting and not for video capture to tape.

4)  In the Audio truck, it asks for outboard effects (TC 6000, Eventide H 3000, etc...) that doesn't seem to be necessary if we are just recording.  Is it okay to eliminate that gear also? No.  We made this for tape to tape later. 

5)  Can we bring 1 single truck that has the ability to record the video and audio instead of bringing two separate trucks?   Yes, provided the audio and video can work independently during the shoot and at the end of the shoot the audio and video product are delivered in specified formats.

6)  Who is providing power for the video/audio truck(s)? The performance site; Strathmore.

7)  Does it matter what the location of the non-linear edit suite is? No. If it does not matter and the suite is out of state, who pays for travel costs for the producer? The government will.

8)  Are you allowed to bid on specific parts of the rfq
i.e. remote video production, but not audio production truck Yes.  

9) This is considered an entertainment event, as opposed to a government event. Does the government understand that certain entertainment rates can apply? Yes

10) Additional people will be needed above and beyond the personnel listed, does the government accept that
i.e production manager, tech manager, utilities, production assistants, associate director?  All personnel required for the job should be accounted for in the vendor?s bid.

11) Overtime is a certainity on this job, does the government accept this?  The following is a firm fixed price type contract. 
Please bid accordingly.

12) For a job like this, it would be advisable to park and power and set up the truck on Thursday, with a full rehearsal scheduled on Friday. Is this acceptable?  No.  We do not have access to the job site until Friday.

13) Does the government have a proposed  schedule for Friday and Saturday? Yes.  It?s in the statement of work and per the statement of work it does say tentative.  
              
14) Due to the truck specifications does the government understand that additional power will be needed?  Power provided for the event is listed at the Strathmore website under tech specs.  Any additional power the vendor should account for and include in his bid. 

15) No pricing can be finalized until a site survey by the parties.  Have the vendor arrange a site survey with the venue.  We have done market research with other vendors and nobody so far has requested a site visit.

16) Are the dates firm for this production? Yes

17) When will a decision be made on the rfq? Shortly after the close out on the 19th.

18) With the short notice, some key personnel, ie. TD, 1 or 2 cameras, etc may need to be brought in from out of town, does the government accept and understand that this may be necessary? What ever personnel the vendor feels they need to do the job, they should account for in their bid.

19) There is an assumption that the job is being shot in standard definition? Yes

20) For a production like this, wide angle lenses would be a major asset can we add this to the budget?  No.  We have not included a specification for this type of lens.

CONTRACT TYPE - NAVAIR is willing to consider various types of procurement vehicles using FAR/DFARS and/or non-procurement assistance vehicles using DoDGARS, such as Grants/Agreements under 10 U.S.C. 2358 or Technology Incentive Awards under 10 U.S.C. 2371 or U.S.C. 2358 (Congressional direction requires that at least 50 percent of the cost of a project under this initiative be provided by industry) and Section 845, Authority to Carry Out Certain Prototype Projects.  Selecting appropriate contract/agreement type is ultimately determined by the Contracting Officer.

Contract modifications may be executed to satisfy these requirements, thereby providing for flexibility in technology assessment (with technology transition the ultimate goal). In the event that this is required, it shall be considered to be within the scope of the contract, which resulted from this BAA, and therefore will have met FAR/DFARS requirements and the Competition in Contracting Act. 
AWARDS - Contract award will be based on the proposal's technical merit, cost, and availability of appropriations. There is no commitment by the Navy to be responsible for any monies expended by the offeror prior to award of a contract. Offerors are cautioned that only a Contracting Officer is legally authorized to commit the Government. 
POINTS OF CONTACT - The offerors may email the technical point of contact at James.Sheehy@navy.mil for technical inquiries, and Melisha.Proctor@navy.mil for contractual guidance.

<DESC>This combined synopsis/solicitation is hereby amended to extend the Response Date to NLT 4:30 p.m. on June 29, 2007 and to provide answers to offerors questions.  Any additional questions are to be submitted in writing to Cynthia Ybarra, FLETC, 1300 W.

Written replies to questions will be provided as an amendment to this combined synopsis/solicitation.

What are the Electrical connections for the washers and dryers:
     
1. The equipment electrical service can be either 200 or 400 voltage 3 phase service.  

Answer:  Washers (20 Amps) 3-Phase @ 480VAC, and Dryers (30 Amps) 3-Phase @ 480VAC.
  
2. Facility provides the electrical service boxes for the equipment to be connected to?

Answer:  YES 

Washer Water Connections:

1. Washers will be shipped with 1 inch water hoses, for connection to 1 inch water line service provided by facility. Each connection needs a shutoff valve for isolation between washer and water feed connection.  

Answer:  Building Hot and Cold Water branch service supply lines remains 3/4 inch NPT with isolation valves. 

Washer Drain too?
1. Do the washers drain to a pit/drain trough or into a sewer line.  

Answer:  Drain Through 
2. If sewer line what size and capacity flow of this line?  

Answer:  N/A 

Dryers:
1. Gas type Natural Gas or LP-Gas pipe connection required 1 inch.  

Answer:  Natural Gas branch line remains 3/4 inch. 

2. Connection Exhaust duct work for dryers should be all individual 12 inch either through wall or roof. Who is performing this work in connecting exhaust duct work to outside. 

Answer:  Vent is 12 inch, and final connection to building exhaust system shall be provided by equipment supplier. 

3. Duct work proposal would only be to connect dryer to interior duct work in facility. If additional work would be needed I would need to be sent drawings for exhaust system pertaining to the dryers. 

Answer:  See last comment. 

Special Note on Dryers:
I notice that in the bid proposal there was no mention of fire protection for the dryers. While there is an additional cost for this feature it requires a water connection and internal changes in the dryer connections. Since all the recent Government Contracts for dryers have required that addition could you let me know if I have to add this to the dryer equipment?  

Answer:  Not  Required.

All other terms and conditions of the original combined synopsis/solicitation remain the same.

I17D01   52.217-9C03   OPTIONS FOR INCREASED QUANTITY   (OCT 2001)   DSCC 
(a) The Government may require delivery of additional supplies in accordance with the CLIN(S) identified as Option CLIN(S) in Section B.
(b) The option may be exercised in one or more increments at the time of award and after award during the period of the contract delivery schedule minus 14 days.  The total amount of supplies ordered under this option will not exceed the maximum specified in Section B but may be less than the maximum amount.  A written notice mailed or otherwise furnished by the DSCC contracting officer to the contractor within the time specified shall constitute an exercise of the option.  Delivery schedule is defined as follows:
(1) The delivery schedule means a period of time from the date of award to the last scheduled delivery date of any CLIN, including CLINs added by modification (other than option exercises) as stated in the modification.
(2) Modifications extending the delivery schedule shall be interpreted as extending the option period, unless otherwise stated in the modification.
(3) Modifications accelerating the delivery schedule shall NOT be interpreted as reducing the option period, unless otherwise stated in the modification.
(c) Prior to option exercise, the contractor voluntarily may reduce option price or improve delivery time by written notice to the contracting officer.
(d) Delivery of supplies ordered pursuant to this clause shall be required within the same number of days as the original contract quantity, computed from date of option exercise.  However, if First Article Testing is required under the contract and the First Article Test has been waived or passed at time of award of the option, delivery time for option quantities shall be reduced by the amount of time specified for reduction based upon FAT waiver as specified under contract clauses I09D04, DSCC 52.209-9C07 or I09D06, DSCC 52.209-9C11.  If additional time is required for delivery of the option quantity the contractor must submit a written request to the contracting officer within 10 days after receipt of option notice.
(e) If the specifications are changed prior to option exercise or if the option exercise specifies different delivery points or packing requirements other than stated in the contract, the price and delivery time for the option exercise quantity shall be subject to adjustment under the clause entitled "Changes".
(f) The Government may reject an offer as nonresponsive if it is materially unbalanced as to prices for the basic requirement and the option quantities.  An offer is unbalanced when it is based on prices significantly less than cost for some work and prices which are significantly overstated for other work.
NOTE:  FAILURE TO SUBMIT AN OFFER ON THE OPTION CLIN(S) IN SECTION B MAY RESULT IN REJECTION OF BID/OFFER.
