<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Sensors Directorate has a planned new research program called Passive Radar Illumination Selection Manager (PRISM). The PRISM program will research, design, document, and test an Illumination Selection Manager (ISM) subsystem in furtherance of the Passive MultiMode (PMM) vision. PMM seeks a multi-mode passive radar system which adapts to local conditions. The ISM testing will demonstrate real-time functionality. A roadmap shall be developed outlining the approach to an ISM suitable for current and future platforms. The PRISM effort will have two objectives. The first objective will be to design and implement a real-time ISM algorithm. Inputs to the ISM will be emitter reports from a front-end Electronic Support subsystem. Outputs from the ISM will be commands to a back-end surveillance data collection subsystem. The second objective will be to develop a technology roadmap for an operational ISM capability. This is a pre-solicitation notice only. Anticipated issue date for the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is TBD at this time. Details of the BAA will be included when the BAA is issued via FedBizOpps.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under the statutory authority of 10 USC 2304(c) (1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(A) and (B), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the United States which is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in filling the agency's requirement.
<p><br />The Government has conducted extensive market research leading up to development of its acquisition strategy, issuing Request for Information (RFI), Reference Number FA8818-16-R-0024 (Posted 25 February 2016). The industry responses have identified a future potential for competition of the requirement for certified Minuteman Flight Termination Systems (MM FTS Hardware). However, at this time, there are no other contractors who are capable of providing delivery of this hardware within the required timeframe and without substantial cost duplication including additional pass-through costs of non-ordnance producing contractors. Cost duplication of ordnance producing contractors would include: flight hardware modification and associated drawing, engineering, and procedures updates required to integrate a new MM FTS design with launch vehicle contractor hardware; AF installation documentation updates and technician training; and increased mission assurance support through all phases including updates to AF training and installation procedures, users guides, and range safety documentation. These requirements for a new MM FTS design also significantly push out the schedule at which first use of the new design could commence which is unacceptable for an immediate requirement.</p>
<p>This sole source contract will allow Pacific Scientific Energetic Materials Company (PSEMC) to provide/deliver Modular Mechanical Ordnance Destruct System (MMODS) components as the MM FTS hardware components. PSEMC is able to provide MMODS with no additional pass-through costs, and no additional costs for integrating with launch vehicle contractor's existing hardware. They are also able to best utilize the inert government furnished property available from previous unused and expired MMODS kits, and they are able to deliver the requirement within the schedule critical path.</p>
<p>While this notice of intent is for informational purposes only, and is not a request for competitive proposals, interested parties (to include small and small disadvantaged businesses) may identify their interest and technical capability, and submit information which will be considered by the agency for a future competitive requirement. The applicable NAICS code is 336419 with a corresponding size standard of 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>This announcement constitutes the only notice for this effort.</p>
<p>This acquisition action does not assume that PSEMC is the only contractor who can complete this action. This action only assumes that there are no contractors, at this time, who are capable of providing this equipment without substantial duplication of costs and within the required schedule. The Justification and Approval document will be made available on FBO within 14 days of contract award.</p>

<p><strong>Authority: IHS (Division of Engineering Services (DES))</strong> Seattle is issuing this synopsis in accordance with FAR Part 5.204 Pre-solicitation Notices.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> <strong>The proposed contract listed here is 100 percent set-aside for small business concerns.  The Government will only accept offers from small business concerns. All other firms are deemed ineligible to submit offers.</strong></p>
<p>This is a new procurement.  It does not replace an existing contract.  No prior contract information exists.  A Sources Sought was issued on 18 August 2016 in order to conduct Market Research. This is a Pre-solicitation notice. The Request for Qualifications will be available on or around 12/30/16, on www.fbo.gov, under the solicitation number 16-102-SOL-00023.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals</strong>, <strong>and no contract will be awarded as a result of this notice or any follow-up information requests.</strong></span> In order to protect the procurement integrity of any future procurement, if any, that may arise from this notice, information regarding the technical point of contact will not be given and no appointments for presentations will be made. <br /><br /><strong>The anticipated work includes, but is not limited to:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> The Rapid City Service Unit (RCSU) provides health care to Indian people in Rapid City, South Dakota and the surrounding area, and is unique because it is located in an urban area and not on a reservation. The current Sioux San campus consists of 29 buildings, of which 19 are categorized as historical, and 3 structures, of which two are categorized as historical.  Indian Health Service owns the land and buildings.</p>
<p><strong>The Statement of A/E Services for the proposed project includes </strong>detailed design for construction, furniture, equipment, information technology (IT), and audio-visual (AV) and any other related services to construct a replacement facility to support an ambulatory care facility with the addition of the following services:  Audiology, Public Health Nutrition, Physical Therapy, Psychiatric Consultation and Podiatry. It is anticipated that this requirement will be procured in accordance with FAR Subpart 36.6, Architect-Engineer Services.</p>
<p><strong>The estimated cost range of this design requirement is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.</strong></p>
<p>All offerors are advised that in accordance with 36.601-(3)(b) the total cost of the architect or engineer services contracted for must not exceed six (6) percent of the estimated cost of the construction project plus any fees for related services and activities. Additionally, FAR Clause 52.236-2 (c) - Design within Funding Limitation, will be applicable to this procurement action.  Design limitation costs will be provided to the most highly rated AE firm selected to complete the design.</p>
<p><strong>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code</strong> is 541310 Architectural Services, with a Small Business Size Standard of $7.5 million.</p>
<p><strong>Competitive Acquisition:</strong> The solicitation will utilize source selection procedures FAR 36.602.  The offeror will be required to submit Qualification Statements (SF-330s) for evaluation by the Government.</p>
<p><strong>Contract Type:</strong> Indian Health Service intends to award a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) A/E Contract in support of this requirement.</p>
<p><strong>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Period of Performance: </strong><br /><br />The Period of Performance will be 730 calendar days from the date of notice to proceed.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTICE:</strong> In formulating the Qualifications submission, potential respondents should consider that FAR 52.219-14, which will be incorporated into any resultant contract, requires the Prime Contractor to perform services under the contract equivalent to 50% or more of the contract value in personnel costs throughout the life of the contract. This is a positive requirement rather than one where an indication of capacity, capability or willingness to meet these requirements would be acceptable. Respondent(s) should demonstrate in their Qualifications submission how they will meet this requirement. Although the specific project effort awarded under any resultant contract is not known at this time, it is believed to be unlikely a Respondent could reasonably expect to meet this FAR requirement where they propose a Prime Contractor role limited to a single discipline, or possibly even multiple disciplines, where the discipline mix proposed leans towards disciplines typically not heavily utilized in A-E Services for Health Facilities Engineering projects.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer and Important Notes All respondents must register on the SAM located At http://www.sam.gov/.</strong></p>

The purpose of this contracted effort is the professional development of Department of the Navy civilian employees.  The Commander, Naval Information Forces (COMNAVIFOR) requires a vendor to create and deliver two targeted leadership development programs of study.    

The programs of study are to be aligned to the Department of Defense (DoD) Civilian Leader Development Framework, which can be found in Table 1 of Department of Defense Instruction 1430.16 entitled Growing Civilian Leaders.
  The two required programs are:

1. Senior Leadership Development Program (SLDP):  27 (non-consecutive) days of classroom-based training to meet civilian leadership development requirements for government civilians in the equivalent grades of GS-13 through GS-15.  

2. Mid-Level Leadership Development Program (MLDP):  24 (non-consecutive) days of classroom-based training to meet civilian leadership development requirements for government civilians in the equivalent grades of GS-10 through GS-12.

This is a new requirement.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 611430, Professional and Management Development Training, with a Small Business size standard of $11.0M.
  After analyzing submittals received in response to a Sources Sought Notice posted on 27 May 2016, the Request for Quote (RFQ) will be set aside for Woman or Women-owned Small Businesses (WOSBs).

The resulting contract, if awarded, will be for a five-year ordering period.  FAR 52.217-8 â€œOption to Extend Servicesâ€ will be included in the solicitation and contract.

 By submitting a quote, the vendor is self-certifying that neither the requestor nor the principal corporate officials and owners are currently suspended, debarred, or otherwise ineligible to receive contracts from any federal agency. Failure to do so may represent grounds for refusing to accept the offer. By submission of a quote, the contractor acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation, except for awards to foreign vendors for work to be performed outside the United States.

The Government physically does not have in its possession, sufficient, accurate or legible data to repair this part from other than the current source. Only the source previously approved by the Government for this item ha been solicited. The subject item requires Government source approval prior to award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such than an award can not be delayed pending approval of a new source.
 If you are not an approved source, you must submit, together with your proposal the information detailed in https://www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx NAVSUP source approval request at www.navsup.navy.mil. If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which was forwarded with your request for source approval. If evaluation of a source approval request submitted can not be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the availability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on fleet support needs.

<DESC>PR-ORD-16-01065: Four Month Extension to EP-D-11-058 - Facilities Operation &amp; Maintenance Support Services
<p>Intent to Sole Source:<br />NAICS Code: 561210 Facilities Support Services. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has a requirement for continuation of services under the current contract, EP-D-11-058, as described below. EP-D-11-058 expires on September 30, 2016. The Government intends to compete, negotiate, and award follow on services to this contract for a base and five option periods in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR). However the contract for follow on services will not be awarded prior to the expiration date of EP-D-11-058. The services under this contract are critical and cannot lapse. The EPA intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, with Native Energy &amp; Technology, Inc., 110 Broadway St Ste 320, San Antonio, TX 78205-1960 and exercise FAR clause 52.217-8 -- Option to Extend Services to extend services under this contract, not to exceed four additional months of service, until such time that the competition for the follow-on Facilities Operations &amp; Maintenance (O&amp;M) Support Services contract is completed and a follow-on contract is awarded.</p>
<p>Native Energy &amp; Technology, Inc. (NET) currently provides the stated facilities O&amp;M support services (scheduled preventive maintenance and repair, janitorial services, grounds maintenance services, guard services, and other services including pest control, elevator maintenance, solid waste removal, copier maintenance, etc; materials and repair parts associated with scheduled preventive maintenance; and unscheduled repair materials and subcontractor labor for unscheduled repairs) for the EPA's Office and Research and Development (ORD) National Exposure Research Laboratory (NERL), Ecosystems Research Division (ERD) ORD-Athens Laboratory (ORD-Athens) facilities located at 960 College Station Road, Athens, GA 30605-2700, under contract EP-D-11-058 and has provided these services and support under said contract since April 2011. The continuity that NET's services will provide are critical to ORD research priorities and to ensure continuity of research.</p>
<p>There are no other entities that have the capability of providing the level, breadth, and depth of support that are required by the ORD-Athens Laboratory facility in order to maintain a fully functioning facility with the least amount of disruption in a short period of time on a temporary basis.</p>
<p>NET is best suited for continuing to provide the above indicated services and support for the requested four month extension as they have the necessary infrastructure, personnel, supplies, and subcontractors already in place, fully functioning, and doing so will guarantee continuity of services for the ORD-Athens Laboratory facilities while the Government completes the competition for the follow-on Facilities Operations &amp; Maintenance (O&amp;M) Support Services contract is completed and a follow-on contract is awarded.</p>
<p>The Government is not stating that there are no other contractors who can support this facilities O&amp;M support services requirement. The Government understands that there are other companies that provide similar facilities O&amp;M support services. The Government is instead saying that considering the short period of performance contemplated within this extension and that the actual base and four option period follow on contract award will be competed amongst eligible, qualified companies, that no other contractors could transition this workload from NET and efficiently continue performance without potential reduced services, increased costs, and unnecessary risks to the Government. This four month extension of services is not an attempt by the Government to limit competition to the incumbent contractor but to provide additional time to complete the evaluation of proposals received and the award of a follow-on contract.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR Part 5.207(c)(16)(ii), all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the Agency. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon response to this notice, is solely within the direction of the Government.</p>
<p>This notice will be posted for 15 days.</p>
<p>The intent of this synopsis is to state the Government's intention to sole source this requirement and to determine if any other source(s) exist; and, therefore, no solicitation is available. All interested parties who believe they can provide the required service should 1) fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing and submit same via FedConnect, a government web portal, within 15 days from the date of this announcement; and 2) must submit itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.</p>
<p>Consequently, any responder(s) failing to provide the aforementioned data but instead choosing merely to submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will not be honored. Offerors must submit all technical questions / responses concerning this synopsis electronically through FedConnect at www.fedconnect.net/Fedconnect/. This notice and any amendments will be available via the Internet at the following URL: www.fedconnect.net/FedConnect/ .

White papers shall be limited to twelve pages with two additional pages for technical drawings. Acknowledgment of receipt of white papers will not be made and white papers will not be returned.</p>
<p><br />Data Requested<br />Specifically, this announcement is looking for experience/expertise in the development of a Virtual Training Product, to provide a simulation-based capability that delivers an interactive multimedia instruction (IMI) training solution for the Rocket, Artillery, Mortar (RAM) Warn System-of-Systems (SoS) focused on simulated hands&#8208;on equipment hardware, software, and firmware. The objective of this effort is to improve and sustain training efficiency and effectiveness through a virtual training environment that conveys all course material, increases student comprehension and retention, and provides a means to measure and track student performance. RAM Warn primary mission is to alert U.S. forces of enemy Indirect Fire (IDF) attacks.</p>
<p>Development of this simulation-based training capability will require in-depth knowledge and technical expertise of the RAM Warn system architecture and its interfaces with the Army's Air Defense Airspace Management (ADAM) and Field Artillery Radars currently fielded. Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) must understand the technical and engineering applications that connect RAM Warn components with existing radars and the command and control capability in the ADAM already fielded at the Brigade Combat Team (BCT). This in-depth knowledge and expertise of the RAM Warn system interfaces is critical to effectively modeling a simulated training environment that will keep Soldiers highly proficient in perishable technical skills such as configuration management, emplacement, and march-order procedures.</p>
<p>The RAM Warn Virtual Training Product simulation software must be consistent with current RAM Warn training and technical materials, consisting of multiple modules providing instruction on high priority tasks and system equipment sets. These simulation products must be designed to work both together and separately, and must be interoperable and compatible with previously developed Air and Missile Defense Planning and Control System (AMDPCS) simulation training products in order to accurately reflect and maintain consistency of ADAM cell training objectives relative to both systems. The training modules shall be playable within a simulation&#8208;based training system.</p>
<p>Support is required to provide IMI training modules which includes the following task areas: <br />1. RAM Warn SoS Familiarization System Overview <br />2. C-RAM C2 BCT Operator <br />3. Sensor Link Operator <br />4. Sensor Link System Admin <br />5. Sensor Link Field Maintainer<br />6. C-RAM Distributed SoS Simulation (CDS3)<br />7. Warn 3.0 Operator<br />8. Warn 3.0 System Admin<br />9. Warn 3.0 Field Maintainer<br />10. RAM Warn SoS Integration Exercise</p>
<p>SME support is also required for Cybersecurity requirements implications on system training in regards to system design and interfaces between RAM Warn, C-RAM C2 within the ADAM, and fielded radar systems. All SME personnel must have tactical operational knowledge of the RAM Warn hardware/software/firmware and associated software systems residing in the ADAM and/or Field Artillery Radars. Additionally, SME support is required to provide other functional services related to development of the RAM Warn virtual training product such as Configuration Management (CM), Data Management (DM), Security, and Environmental Compliance.</p>
<p>Firms should identify their management approach in the identification and selection of personnel to provide the desired solution. Initial training of personnel to perform the desired support will not be authorized on any resultant contract. All proprietary material should be clearly marked and will be held in the strictest confidence. At a minimum, the white paper shall address four areas: the submitter's expertise within the domain, the technical approach, personnel approach, and a summary of expertise and experience. Provide a statement on how the following key attributes will be met:</p>
<p>1. Personnel Availability - discuss the approach for identifying, recruiting and selecting personnel to provide the desired support.</p>
<p>2. Personnel Selection - discuss the approach, including prerequisite qualifications, for determining the selection of personnel to perform the desired support. Identify the experience and education attributes to be used in selecting personnel.</p>
<p>3. Key personnel - discuss approach for the identification of key personnel and defining their duties and responsibilities.</p>
<p>4. Assignment location - discuss the approach for identifying and selecting personnel with the necessary qualifications for assignments at multiple locations.</p>
<p>5. Management - discuss the management approach to be used to organize and control a system to provide the desired product and services.</p>
<p>6. Experience - discuss past experience in producing virtual training products delivering IMI solutions as training applications for military systems of comparable or sufficiently similar complexity that would qualify the selected personnel to provide required product and services.</p>
<p>Responses must include company name, Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, mailing address, place of performance, and appropriate point of contact information. Responses must also identify themselves as a small or large business.</p>

This acquisition will involve the use of streamlined acquisition procedures employing best practices for competitive negotiated procurements as authorized by the FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS).  The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 561612 - Security Guards and Patrol Services. The small business size standard for this code is $20.5 million.  

Tiered Evaluation: In order to provide opportunities for small businesses and to ensure that FAA requirements are met, the acquisition strategy for this procurement includes the use of a tiered evaluation of offerors with the following tiers:

I.	SEDB/8(a) Businesses
II.	Small Businesses
III.	Other Than Small Businesses

(1) Tiered evaluation of offers is a process by which FAA promotes small business participation while providing FAA a means to continue the procurement if small business participation is insufficient.

(2) The FAA may use tiered evaluation of offers to promote competition in each tier of small business concerns while still allowing other than small business to participate without issuing another SIR.

With the exception of joint ventures, all business classifications will be encouraged to submit offers for this SIR.  The FAA will proceed with the evaluation of offerors and award within the lowest tier found to contain adequate competition among technically acceptable offers. Adequate competition exists when two or more responsible offerors, competing independently, submit priced offers that satisfy the Governmentâ€™s expressed requirement. If only one proposal is received in a lower tier, this offer from a lower tier may compete with higher tiered submissions in order to achieve adequate competition.

Each offeror may be considered as a prime contractor for only one Service Area award but have the ability to pursue subcontracting opportunities on other Service Area awards without restriction. The FAA will only recognize one Prime Contractor per offer. Under the first two tiers, Small Business offerors are reminded that in accordance with AMS clause 3.6.1-7 Limitations on Subcontracting, at least 50% of the work must be performed by employees of the Prime contractor. AMS clause 3.6.1-7 may be viewed in full text at http://conwrite.faa.gov.   Under the third tier, in accordance with Section I AMS Clause 3.6.1-4 Small, Small Disadvantaged, Women-Owned and Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Subcontracting Plan (August 2012) (c) the offeror, upon request by the Contracting Officer, shall submit and negotiate a subcontracting plan, where applicable, that separately addresses subcontracting with small business, small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business and service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns. 

Alternate proposals will not be evaluated. In the event a proposal is rejected a notice will be sent to the Offeror stating the reason(s) that the proposal will not be given further consideration.

All responses to this SIR must follow all submission instructions found in Section L of the SIR.

The FAA will not pay any costs incurred in the preparation or submission of any response to this solicitation.

<CONTACT>Grace H. Garrity, Phone 3019752345, Email grace.garrity@nist.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST) seeks vendors that are capable of providing a specialized heat stabilization instrument to support NIST measurement efforts at the Hollings Marine Laboratory. This announcement is not a Request for Proposals or Quotes (RFP/RFQ) and does not commit the Government to award a contract now or in the future. The information contained in this notice is DRAFT only and as such, is subject to change prior to issuance of a solicitation. No solicitation is available at this time. After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed, NIST may conduct a competitive or non-competitive procurement and subsequently award a contract. If at least two qualified small business sources are identified during this market research stage, this acquisition may be solicited as a small business set aside. NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large and small businesses (SB, SDB, WOSB, HUB Zone, SDVOSB and VOSB). This requirement is assigned a NAICS code of 334516 with a Small Business Size Standard of 1,000 employees.
<p>Preliminary market research efforts indicated that only one source was capable of providing equipment with the required capabilities, but in the interest of due diligence in market research, this notice seeks to identify any other vendors that may be capable of providing this equipment.</p>
<p>Interested business organizations that believe they may be capable of meeting NIST's requirements detailed below should respond to this notice with a narrative demonstrating their ability to meet NIST's requirements. Contractors may provide supplemental information at their discretion. Responses should be submitted to Grace.Garrity@nist.gov no later than 9:00 AM Eastern Time on 12/16/2016.</p>
<p>NIST's potential requirements are described below:</p>
<p>Metabolite stability is an often overlooked component of many omic workflows, yet extremely vital. For metabolite-based studies to be validated, identification and quantification of metabolites should be minimally influenced by pre-analytical factors (such as clotting factors, time to freezing, homogenization, etc.). The preservation of the native metabolite profile from the time of collection is an ongoing pre-analytical challenge. Flash freezing samples in liquid nitrogen immediately after collection is considered one approach to immediately halt metabolic activity in the sample. However, recent data from NIST's laboratory suggests that this alone may not stop enzymatic activity (and consequential breakdown or conversion of metabolites). Sample collection in the natural environment (field studies) also pose a difficulty in this regard, as the availability of liquid nitrogen may be limited, and thus samples may not exhibit a true native profile when analyzed. Laboratory studies are not exempt from issues using flash freezing. The integrity of samples is maintained by remaining in a frozen state until chemical extraction; however, it is often necessary to weigh samples prior to extraction where thawing is undoubtedly occurring (increasing likelihood of enzymatic activity until extraction). Current options to better preserve the metabolite profile have included using inhibitors or chemical stabilizers; however, these additives are generally targeted and narrow in benefit (and not conducive to global omic profiling, meaning they generally only help a small sub-set of metabolites) and while these additives can be readily applied to liquid matrices such as plasma, solid matrices, such as tissues, require alternative approaches.</p>
<p>The required equipment is an instrument that can provide a means to control stability of metabolites in a variety of matrices at various periods in the workflow. This "heat stabilization" instrument provides a controlled, pre-programmed approach to uniformly heat (conductive, i.e. heating the whole sample at once, instantaneously), which could be effectively applied to enhance stability during sample collection, sample processing and extraction, and sample storage (both long and short term). The concept of heat treatment (non-additive based) has been used as early as the 1940s, mostly achieved using crude heating devices (heat block, water bath, calorimeter). The required equipment is a state of the art adaptation of this concept: an instrument that allows a researcher to rapidly and uniformly heat a sample with explicit control of heating parameters (i.e. temperature) and pre-programmed heating templates based on the type and amount of sample analyzed. In addition, the instrument should be compatible with several sample matrices, including solid, liquid and dried blood spot media, using different cards. The system should also be compatible with both fresh and frozen samples, an important aspect for our work and ongoing efforts with the NIST Specimen Bank at HML. Also, due to NIST's environmental applications (collecting samples in the field), NIST also requires an instrument that is small, portable, and easy to use (standardized and repeatable). Essentially, NIST requires an instrument with the functionality capable of allowing the development of methods to reproducibly preserve samples and/or metabolites at any stage in the omic workflow.</p>

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought for information and planning purposes.  Naval Supply Center (NAVSUP) Fleet Logistics Center (FLC) Norfolkâ€™s intent of this announcement is to identify qualified and experienced sources for a contract vehicle that will provide comprehensive operational and environmental support for Fleet training range complexes and operations as defined in the attached draft Performance Work Statement.

Anticipated NAICS Code
The NAICS Code for this requirement is 541620 â€“ Environmental Consulting Services and the Size Standard is $15 million.
 The Government has not yet determined whether an existing strategically sourced vehicle will be used to satisfy this requirement. If it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government to utilize Seaport-E, then the applicable NAICS code and size standard will be 541330 â€“ Engineering Services and $38.5 million. Respondents should provide their business size in both potential NAICS. 

Reponses to this Sources Sought request should reference N00189-17-T-0026 and shall include the following information in this format: 

1.	Company name, address, point of contact name, phone number, fax number and email address. 

2.	Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) Code.

3.	If the services can be solicited from a GSA schedule, provide the GSA contract number.

4.	If your company has an applicable GSA Oasis contract, please identify the particular Oasis pool to which your company belongs.

5.	If the services can be solicited from SeaPort, provide the contract number.

6.	Size of business - Large Business, Small Business, Small Disadvantage, 8(a), Hubzone, Woman-owned and/or Service Disabled Veteran-owned.

7.	An estimated Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM).

If past performance information is provided, please include only relevant past performance on the same/similar work within the last 5 years.  Please also include in past performance information the contract numbers, dollar value, and period of performance for each contract referenced in the response to this sources sought.  

10.	The Government is still determining the acquisition strategy and if this acquisition will be a small business set-aside, then FAR clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, applies.
 Note that if there is sufficient demonstrated interest and capability among small businesses, a key factor in determining if an acquisition will be a small business set-aside is that two or more potential small business prime contractors must be capable of performing at least 50% of the effort, as defined in FAR clause 52.219-14.

If it is determined that a small business set-aside is appropriate and your company anticipates submitting a proposal as the prime contractor for a small business set-aside, please provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, and if subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of the effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large business subcontractors will be used.
 Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided.

11.	Include any other supporting documentation.

12.	Comments or suggested changes to the Governments NAICS Determination
 
13.	Identify conditions or issues the U.S. Government should consider or may interfere with the intention of this project.

<DESC>NAVSUP WSS intends to issue a two year extension under BOA N00383-14-G-009D with BAE Systems in Greenlawn, NY for various NSNs.The Government physically does not have in its possession, sufficient, accurate or legible data to repair this part from other than the current source. Only the source previously approved by the Government for this item ha been solicited. The subject item requires Government source approval prior to award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such than an award can not be delayed pending approval of a new source.
 If you are not an approved source, you must submit, together with your proposal the information detailed in https://www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx NAVSUP source approval request at www.navsup.navy.mil. If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which was forwarded with your request for source approval. If evaluation of a source approval request submitted can not be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the availability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on fleet support needs.

<DESC><p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) John C. Stennis Space Center (SSC) Office of Procurement (OP) is seeking potential sources from all categories of Large and Small Businesses with the capabilities and experience to provide the requirement described herein. The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice, therefore, is to conduct market research to determine potential sources, capabilities of Small Business firms, availability of services, appropriate terms and conditions, lead time of delivery/period of performance, transportation options, etc. necessary to provide the required services to SSC, as well as explore interest in both the immediate requirement and potential arrangements/options for dry-dock for up to the entire fleet. <br />SSC has set a distance restriction for the contractor's location to be no further than 125 nautical miles from SSC.</p>
<p>SSC wishes to determine if there are Small Business (SB), Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Certified 8(a) Small Business, HUBZone Small Business (HUBZone), Woman-Owned Small Business (WOSB), Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), or (HBCU), firms with the capabilities and experience to meet the Government's requirement, and the appropriate level of competition and/or Small Business subcontracting goals if applicable. The NAICS Code and Size Standard for this requirement are 336611 and 1,250 Employees, respectively.</p>
<p>The work to be performed includes the dry-dock, inspection (repair as required), and painting of SSC's fleet of propellant and work barges. The fleet consists of ten (10) barges (six (6) Liquid Oxygen (LOX) barges, three (3) Liquid Hydrogen (LH) barges, and one (1) work barge). SSC has an immediate requirement for dry-dock of one (1) LOX barge and future dry-dock requirements for the entire fleet.</p>
<p>SSC is particularly interested in industry's input regarding the following questions:</p>
<p>1. Would the vendor be interested in bidding on a five (5) year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) with an immediate requirement for dry-dock of one (1) LOX barge? <br /><br />2. If not, what is inhibiting the vendor's interest? Please be specific. <br /><br />3. If the vendor is not interested in bidding, can recommendations of other potential vendors that may be interested be provided?<br /><br />4. In the vendor's experience, what would a typical time between dry-docks be for barge vessels of the type described below?<br /><br />5. What is the best approach bidding fixed priced elements, i.e. labor rates, structural steel, welding?<br /><br />6. Describe any industry practices that would need to be included in the requirements.</p>
<p>The information gathered from this Sources Sought Notice will be used for market research analysis and to plan future procurements. Based upon information submitted in response to this Sources Sought Notice, NASA will determine the final content of any future solicitation(s). Submissions will also be evaluated for the purpose of determining whether a future procurement may be conducted as a competitive set-aside or issued under full and open competition (unrestricted). The Government reserves the right to consider a Small, 8(a), SDV, or HUBZone small business set-aside based on responses hereto for this requirement. A determination by the Government not to procure this requirement, based upon responses to this notice or other market research, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Although all comments received will be carefully reviewed and considered for inclusion in any possible later action, the initiators of this request make no commitment to include any particular recommendations. Respondents will NOT be notified of the results of the evaluation of submissions received.</p>
<p>This notice <span style="text-decoration: underline;">should not</span> be construed as a formal Request for Quotation (RFQ) or Proposal (RFP) (solicitation).

The sole purpose of this notice is to identify potential System for Award Management (SAM) Database registered businesses that are interested and capable of performing this work.
<p>Project Description: LD 18 Install Relief Wells. The work shall include installation of approximately 70 pressure relief wells through the floor of the lock chamber at Lock and Dam 18 in Burlington, Iowa. The wells are 8-inch diameter and approximately 35 feet deep. The wells are to be constructed of PVC pipe, with the lower portion surrounded by clean filter stone and the upper portion surrounded by grout (16-inch diameter hole drilled with area outside of 8-inch diameter PVC pipe being backfilled). The work is anticipated to be performed from a floating plant with a water depth of approximately 20 feet. Reclaimed material from the drilling operation has to be tested for hazardous material prior to disposal off-site.</p>
<p>The anticipated period of performance for this project is December 2017 through March 2018. Construction will take place in the wet. It is anticipated that prior to construction, the lock chamber will be drawn down to tail water levels in an effort to reduce the water level in the lock chamber in support of drilling operations. It is expected that divers will be necessary to support the well installation and dewatering will be required. Additionally, the lock will need to be dewatered after the relief wells have been installed in order to test the wells and install pre-cast concrete well head blocks. The contractor must have the capability of moving and placing Government furnished bulkheads (80,000 lbs.) to dewater the lock chamber (dewatering pumps).</p>
<p>Minimum Technically Acceptable Contractor Expertise Criteria: The Contractor must demonstrate through experience, references, project lists, or reports, they possess relevant resources and capability of placing bulkheads (bulkheads provided by the government - approx. weight of 80,000 lbs.) and the ability to dewater the lock chamber (dewatering pumps).</p>

<DESC>Project: Universal Stakeholder Participation Questionnaire (uSPEQÂ®)

Background: The Department of Veterans Affairs is committed to providing specialized treatment and rehabilitation care to Veterans with disabilities. These populations include, but are not limited to, Veterans with spinal cord injury and disorder (SCI&D), blindness or severe visual impairment, traumatic brain injury, amputation, other orthopedic conditions, serious mental illnesses, and homeless Veterans.  As part of our obligation to monitor and assure high quality care to these groups, a valid survey of patient experiences during rehabilitation was launched in 2011 with the uSPEQ survey.  The uSPEQ survey compliments surveys administered to general VA inpatient and outpatient services that are currently monitored with the Survey of Health Experiences of Patients (SHEP).  Given that the underlying instrument that forms the basis of SHEP, the Consumer Assessment of Health Providers and Systems (CAHPS), was not developed to address the specific needs of patients undergoing rehabilitation, therefore, use of the uSPEQ survey was necessary.  VA rehabilitation programs currently are obtaining valid information from their patients on such key areas as: 1) service responsiveness; 2) informed choice; 3) respect of individual needs; 4) functional outcomes and community participation; and 5) overall perceived value.   Without continuing such information collection, and the ability to benchmark with leading rehabilitation facilities within and outside of the VA, we are limited in our ability to do continuous quality improvement, provide informed programmatic development and evaluation, rapidly identify rehabilitation program strengths and weaknesses, or conform with accreditation agency standards.  

Purpose:  The purpose of this requirement is to:
Provide the means to administer the uSPEQÂ® customer experience survey within Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF)-accredited VA medical and psychosocial rehabilitation programs.  This includes access to paper survey forms and web-based surveys as deemed appropriate for the specific patient population served at a program site.
Provide program-specific results, along with benchmarking comparisons, for VA medical and psychosocial rehabilitation programs administering the uSPEQÂ® survey.

Information Requested: The contractor should illustrate its ability by providing supportive documentation that describes past projects and current capabilities that are of similar size, scope, and complexity. Past project information shall include (if applicable) contract/order number, type of contract (i.e., FPP), customer s point of contact information (name/phone/email, position), procuring contracting officer s email address, and contract value.
 
Specific Questions to be Addressed (all questions listed below must answered completely):

Describe your capacity/capability to provide/performance uSPEQ survey requirements for VA rehabilitation patients to support healthcare programs in similar size, scope and complexity as described in the attached draft PWS?

Identify and describe the associated risk with the complexity of this requirement.

Describe your organizations experience with surveys in a rehabilitation setting, specifically veteran s rehabilitation.

The Government has determined the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541611-- Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services is the most appropriate for this require. If the contractor believes another code would be more appropriate, please list the code and justification.

Identify the number of labor hours, labor categories, and any other relevant pricing components/industry standards to consider, that support tasks as described in the attached draft PWS. Include a rationale/justification for a suitable contract type, if other than Firm Fixed Price.

Please specify your organizations social economic category.

Responses: Responses should be single-spaced, 12 point-font, with numbered pages and should not exceed 12 pages in length, including cover page, appendices, tables and figures. Responses should use the following subject heading:  Request for Information (RFI)  Universal Stakeholder Participation Questionnaire (uSPEQÂ®)

THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL OR QUOTE. THE VA IS NOT SEEKING PRICING OR OFFERS.

This is a Request for Information (RFI)/Sources Sought Notice, issued in accordance with FAR 15.201(e), to conduct market research. This RFI/Sources Sought Notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute either a Request for Quotation (RFQ) or a Request for Proposal (RFP); nor is it a promise to issue a RFQ/RFP in the future. This RFI/Sources Sought Notice does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is not seeking proposals at this time, and will not accept any unsolicited proposals. Responders, and not the Government, will pay for any costs incurred while responding to this RFI/Sources Sought Notice. Vendors who don t respond to this RFI/Sources Sought Notice may still participate in any future RFQ/RFP. Information submitted in response to this RFI/Sources Sought Notice is strictly voluntary and becomes the property of the Government. The Government may modify this announcement in the future, as information changes.

This RFI/Sources Sought Notice is market research to help the Department of Veterans Affairs make acquisition decisions. The VA Heartland Network Contracting Office (NCO) 15 is looking for VETBIZ VIP verified SDVOSB and VOSB concerns registered under the NAICS code of 238220 (Plumbing, Heating, and Air-Conditioning Contractors) in both VETBIZ and SAM that are capable of performing Air Changes per hour (ACH) testing in HVAC systems, as described below.

DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES: 
Perform air duct testing and calculate Air Changes per hour (ACH) in the HVAC systems in buildings 1 and 2 on the St. Louis Health Care System campus, John Cochran Division, 915 North Grand Blvd., St. Louis, MO 63106. Test all HVAC systems and components in the defined spaces and verify that test results are within acceptable tolerances. The test is required for annual certification. 

CONTRACT OBJECTIVE:
The purpose of determining the ventilation rate   calculated as Air Changes per hour, or air change rate, abbreviated ACH or ac/h - is to measure:

the air volume added to or removed from a space, or how many times the air within a defined space is replaced per hour;
duct leakage, or airtightness; 
pressure differentials; and
maximum ACH required to prevent (or control) condensation. 

The test shall include: 1) measurement of airflow and pressure relationships in all the defined spaces; 2) measurement of fresh air changes per hour; 3) total air changes per hour; and 4) pressure relationship to adjacent areas.
The Contractor shall identify the deficiencies in the areas that don t meet current VA and industry standards, and recommend solutions to correct those deficiencies.
The Contractor shall submit a detailed report to VA Engineering no later than two weeks after the testing is completed. The Ventilation Rate (or ACH) Report shall include the following information: A. Report Title; B. Report Certification; C. Table of Contents; D. Report Summary/Remarks; E. Appropriate Forms; F. Instrument Calibration; and G. Abbreviations. The report shall accurately represent the system measurements obtained in accordance with the current edition of the NEBB or AABC Procedural Standards for Testing, Adjusting, and Balancing of Environmental Systems. The report shall note any variances from design quantities, which exceed NEBB or AABC tolerances. The report shall clearly spell out any deficiencies uncovered, such as: 1) air and hydronic measurements on the HVAC systems; 2) total air changes and fresh air changes per hour; 3) pressure differentials, as measured in inches of water (iwc). The report shall also recommend solutions to fix the deficiencies in the areas where the air flow and pressure relationship is out of tolerance. And the report shall include notes and comments, as appropriate, to provide VA Engineering with additional details related to the test procedure, system operation and results. VA Engineering will provide the room by room benchmarks for the ACH rates. Nevertheless, ACH rates may change at any time, depending on revisions to VHA Directives and VA Office of Construction & Facilities Management Design Manuals.

CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS:
Testing and certification shall be in accordance with ASHRAE 170-2013 (Addendum k), and the design requirements of the existing HVAC system.
The Contractor shall provide all the labor, supervision, material, and instruments required to perform the air changes testing on the HVAC systems and components.
Air duct testing to calculate the Air Changes per Hour (ACH) shall be performed by an accredited Testing, Adjusting and Balancing Bureau (TABB) certified Contractor.
After each test the Contractor shall submit the test results to VA Engineering.
The Contractor must hold a valid Class A Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Contractor s (ACR) license with a code E endorsement.
The supervisor should be a TABB supervisor, and the technicians should be TABB technicians.
The Contractor shall provide all necessary Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for his (or her) employees.

The intended contract period of performance is one year, with options for renewal.

The assigned NAICS code is: 238220 (Plumbing, Heating, and Air-Conditioning Contractors) and the small business size standard is $15.0 Million.

<DESC>1.0 Introduction
<p>Request for Information. This a Request for Information Only (RFI).</p>
<p>Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) in support of the Program Executive Office Intelligence, Electronic Warfare, and Sensors (PEO IEW&amp;S) Project Manager Distributed Common Ground System-Army (PM DCGS-A), is conducting market research to identify commercial items and/or non-developmental items to satisfy current DCGS-A Increment 1 intelligence capability requirements (draft) at only the battalion echelon. The Government invites all business/academic organizations to respond to this RFI notice.</p>
<p>This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. Solicitations are not available at this time. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. This notice does not constitute a commitment by the United States Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. All information submitted in response to this announcement is voluntary; the United States Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the United States Government. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.</p>
<p>2.0 Background</p>
<p>The DCGS-A is a systems of systems that is comprised of an extensive intelligence architecture that enables distributed processing and information sharing of data from sensors and other sources across the globe; software tools to help the users perform the analyses, update, and share intelligence products; servers that store data and collected intelligence; and alignment to a set of common standards that enable integration of new technology, processes, and ideas. As technology evolves and new warfighting requirements emerge, the DCGS-A capability set needs to be updated to meet the user needs.</p>
<p>DCGS-A will continue to contribute to visualization and situational awareness (SA), thereby enhancing tactical maneuver, maximizing combat power and enhancing the ability to operate in an unpredictable and changing environment throughout the operational spectrum. This RFI is being issued to determine the immediate availability of commercial items or non-developmental items software that can meet the DCGS-A BN requirements (draft).</p>
<p>3.0 White Paper and Battalion (BN) Requirements (draft) Spreadsheet</p>
<p>Interested contractors should provide a white paper (maximum 10 pages) to describe their proposed solution, and return a completed BN Requirements (draft) Spreadsheet no later than 5 January 2017. Please note, the BN Requirements (draft) Spreadsheet, with supporting documentation, are marked as For Official Use Only (FOUO). To obtain a copy of the spreadsheet and related documents, please send an email with your Company Name, Address, and CAGE code to dean.w.tallant.mil@mail.mil and prettina.j.biedenkapp.civ@mail.mil.</p>
<p>The white paper must address at a minimum the following questions and information requests listed below:</p>
<p>1. Describe the proposed solution you offer and describe the type of hardware required to run your BN solution software to include the device type, hard drive space, system memory, graphics card, and CPU requirements.<br />2. Provide a Rough Order of Magnitude of applicable costs of the proposed solution, to include licensing costs (e.g. unlimited enterprise, term (with range pricing), perpetual, follow-on maintenance support). Include whether your software requires a Field Service Engineer (FSE) or Field Service Representative (FSR) and associated costs. Using a FFP contracting mechanism, what is a reasonable amount the government should expect to pay for a minor modification?<br />3. Explain the list of standards that are implemented in your system and sub-systems which facilitate how data ingresses/egresses through defined system interfaces in order to support a modular and open systems approach.<br />4. Provide a detailed list of data types/sources that can be ingested and persisted within system boundaries (Unstructured Text Data (Reports), Entity Data (People, Places, Things), and multi-modal Sensor Data (Images, Video) are examples).<br />5. Explain how your solution would perform data synchronization and maintain interoperability with DCGS-A Increment 1 horizontally and vertically across Army echelons (e.g. with their higher headquarters, with the Army Fixed Sites).<br />6. Explain how your solution would perform over a network that experiences latency, intermittent connectivity, and moments of total network disconnection. Explain how the capability would still operate under these condition and any limitations that may exist.</p>
<p>This notice is part of Government Market Research, a continuous process for obtaining the latest information on the commercial status of the industry. This RFI is for planning purposes, and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will follow.</p>
<p>The Government will use the information submitted in response to this notice at its discretion and will not provide comments to any submission; however, the Government reserves the right to contact any respondent to this notice for the sole purpose of enhancing understanding of the notice submission.

<DESC>The Armed Forces Pest Management Board (AFPMB) is soliciting pre-proposals for original and innovative research designed to develop new interventions for protection of deployed military personnel from diseases caused by arthropod-borne pathogens and to improve control of filth flies.  Diseases of significant concern include malaria, dengue fever, chikungunya fever, and other arboviruses.  The program supports development of: (1) new toxicants or the adaptation of existing toxicants to relevant vectors; (2) new insecticide application techniques; and (3) new personal protection tools that prevent human-vector contact (excluding work on topical repellents).  Ideally the research would support the development, evaluation, and registration of new insecticides, or improved formulations of existing insecticides for vector control, new technology or enhanced modalities of personal protection from biting arthropods, or would improve the efficacy and sustainability of equipment for application of pesticides for vector control in a military operational environment.  Research should be product oriented, consisting of basic or applied research related to a particular product, evaluation of experimental products for military uses, or research directed towards development of an existing product for commercial manufacture.  The research must be primarily applicable to the military but products should be transferable to civilian uses. Program consists of competitive grants open to PIs from academia, industry, and military entomologists. <br>  <br> Potential applicants are encouraged to discuss their proposal ideas with the AFPMB technical contacts listed in Section IV, paragraph G. Federal Awarding Agencies Contacts. <br> Administrative questions concerning the preparation of preproposals or proposals should be addressed to U.S. Army Contracting Command Natick Contracting Division/ Grants Officer. They should be emailed to usarmy.detrick.cbms.mbx.baa@mail.mil,

The technologies embodied in the Causal Exploration platform will enable users to rapidly create, maintain, and interact with a causal model that has been tailored for the operational environment they are facing. Interaction with the model will allow users to explore the causal dynamics driving the conflict, and gain in-depth understanding of the operational environment to support and inform their planning efforts. While this capability will have broad applicability, the program will focus on hybrid or irregular conflicts, which are dominated by complex human system dynamics such as political, ethnic, or religious tensions, low intensity conflict, or economic aggression.</div>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO NEGOTIATE A SOLE-SOURCE CONTRACT<br />The US Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Region Acquisition Division, Simplified Acquisition Branch intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Compumatics Group, LLC, located at 8321 Old Courthouse Road, Suite 360, Vienna, VA, 22182, using the procedures in FAR Part 13, to procure Independent Cost Estimate Services for the National Weather Service's Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS).
<p>The purpose of this independent, non-proponent entity conducting an independent cost estimate is to provide confidence to the Acquisition Executive and senior leadership of NWS, with minimal bias, that the program has reasonably estimated the schedule and cost.  This is a logical follow on contract. Compumatics Group, LLC performed the original independent cost estimate using its proprietary cost estimation methods not available to any other business concern. The use of another contractor to provide an updated cost estimate for independent cost estimating services would lead to a breakdown in the existing cost estimate and the loss of work already completed. <br /> <br />The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) for this acquisition is 561499, All Other Business Support Services, with a business size standard $15 million.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotes.  However, if any other interested party believes that it can meet the requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities, which if timely received, will be considered by NOAA.  A statement of capabilities must be received by 12:00 PM EST on December 6, 2016.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.  Evidence must be provided of ability to provide the required services.  The capability statement and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NOAA to determine if the party can meet all of the requirements.  Capability statements and related materials must be e-mailed to Alexander Cooper at alexander.cooper@noaa.gov by 12:00 PM EST on December 6, 2016.</p>

<DESC>The Smithsonian Institution hereby provides notice of its intention to issue brand-name or equal specification for ETC lighting controls as part of a construction project for installation of Theatrical Lighting Upgrades at its National Museum of the American Indian in Washington, DC to be issued in early 2017. <br /><br />The rationale for selecting ETC is that, according to Smithsonian market research, ETC is the only manufacturer that delivers all Smithsonian requirements for lighting controls at NMAI. These requirements include, but are not limited to, a warranty of performance in line with long-term life cycle costs; reasonable standards for part replacement and legacy system support; integration with existing building systems and alignment with future expansion via modularity; DMX smart lighting capabilities; and the demanding range of lighting direction and control requirements needed by the museum. In addition, ETC lighting controls are capable of web-based control of the system and ETC's web-based control platform includes features that are consistent with Smithsonian IT Security Directives. <br /><br />Please be advised that Smithsonian IT Directives often exceed information technology industry standards and are not waivable. Finally, ETC lighting controls are already installed in other areas of the museum. <br /><br />The full product requirement matrix and market research supporting this position can be obtained by contacting the Smithsonian's Office of Contracting. In lieu of naming ETC as the brand name or equal standard, the Smithsonian will consider including other manufacturers in the specification that can meet or exceed these requirements. Interested distributors or manufacturers should request and review the full product requirement matrix, and supply cut sheets, product information and design requirements to the Smithsonian's point of contact before December 16, 2016. Once received, the Smithsonian shall refer all submissions to its designer of record for confirmation. If submitted lighting controls meet or exceed the Smithsonian's requirements, the Smithsonian will include same as part of its brand name or equal requirement. <br /><br />This notice is for information purposes only. Proposals are not being requested. <br />POC for this request is Eve Errickson, Erricksone@si.edu. <br /><br />Responses must be received by&nbsp;the named POC&nbsp;by the closing date/time of this notice December 16, 2016 by 2:00 pm ET, unless otherwise amended. Submission via email as follows: Erricksone@si.edu. <br /><br />Telephone inquiries will not be accepted or acknowledged, and no feedback or evaluations will be provided to companies regarding their submissions.<br /><br />Interested parties are responsible for routinely checking this website for any amendment to this notice. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes ONLY and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Smithsonian, and/or the Smithsonian will not pay for information solicited and submittals will not be returned to the senders.
<p>AGAIN, THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED AS A RESULT OF THIS NOTICE.</p>

  (a) North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and small business size standard. The NAICS code and small business size standard for this acquisition appear in Block 10 of the solicitation cover sheet (SF 1449).

  (b) Submission of offers. Submit signed and dated offers to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this solicitation. Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show 
    (1) The solicitation number;
    (2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers;
    (3) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror;
    (4) A technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation. This may include product literature, or other documents, if necessary;
    (5) Terms of any express warranty;
    (6) Price and any discount terms;
    (7) "Remit to" address, if different than mailing address;
    (8) A completed copy of the representations and certifications at FAR 52.212-3 (see FAR 52.212-3(b) for those representations and certifications that the offeror shall complete electronically);
    (9) Acknowledgment of Solicitation Amendments;
    (10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information); and
    (11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.
  (c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.
  (d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender's request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.
  (e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.
  (f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers.
    (1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.
    (2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and 
        (A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or
        (B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or
        (C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.
      (ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.
    (3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.
    (4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.
    (5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.
  (g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.
  (h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the offer.
  (i) Availability of requirements documents cited in the solicitation.

The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor's records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred which reasonably could have been avoided.
  (m) Termination for cause. The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon request, with adequate assurances of future performance. In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law.

    (5) Solicitation provisions if this is a solicitation.

    (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
    (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
      (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
    (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims).

TECHNICAL  
 Technical proposals will be initially evaluated as either acceptable or unacceptable with respect to the following factors:

 Technical Factor 1 - Technical Capability (Acceptable/Unacceptable)

 Sub Factor B -  Provide an example reporting tool. Demonstrate that the report is easy to read, comprehensive, customizable, and includes a graphical demonstration of previous specimens tested.  Demonstrate that the report states what testing results are consistent with the patient medication list that will be provided with the sample and what results are inconsistent with the provided list. Reports must also include an estimated detection window for the analytes to assist providers in the interpretation of the results.

Technical Factor 2 -  Certification requirements met(Acceptable/Unacceptable)

Offerors with no relevant history of past performance will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on Past Performance.    
   
   
  Technical and past performances when combined are more important than price.
  (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
  (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

The enterprise must meet these requirements throughout the following time periods: (1) At the time an offer is made in response to a written solicitation; (2) At the time of contract award; and, Cont... <BR> <BR>(3) During the full term of the contract. Indian Tribe means an Indian Tribe, band, nation, or other recognized group or community which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians, including any Alaska Native village, regional or village corporation established under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (PL 92-203, 85 Stat. 688; 43 U.S.C. 1601).

The notification must include full disclosure of circumstances causing the contractor to lose eligibility status and a description of any actions that the contractor will take to regain eligibility.

<RESPDATE>011217
<CONTACT>Neil-Michael Chiaradio, Contracting Officer, Phone 2157373668, Email neil.michael.chiaradio@dla.mil
<DESC>The DLA-Troop Support seeks offers for a full line food distributor who will act as the Subsistence Prime Vendor responsible for the supply and delivery of perishable, semi-perishable, and GFM food items to the US military and other federally funded customers in Afghanistan. <br />This acquisition will be solicited on a full and open competition basis. DLA Troop Support intends to make one (1) award. The length of a contract resulting from this solicitation will be for a term of 60 months, with three separate pricing tiers (instead of Option periods). The first tier shall be for a 24-month period (up to or inclusive of a 6-month ramp up period followed by an 18-month performance period). The second tier, directly following the first, shall be for an 18-month performance period. Finally, the third and final tier, following the second tier, shall be for an 18-month performance period.
<p>The total estimated dollar value including all pricing tiers is $1,500,000,000. The estimated total maximum dollar amount is $3,000,000,000 including all pricing tiers and surge requirements.

Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award <BR> <BR>(a) Inspection/Acceptance.

The Government reserves the right to inspect or test any supplies or services that have been tendered for acceptance.

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <BR> <BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <BR> <BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ``I agree'' click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ``click-wrap'' or ``browse-wrap'' agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u) (1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. (v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor's representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract. <BR> <BR>(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: (1) 52.209-10, Prohibition on Contracting with Inverted Domestic Corporations (Nov 2015).

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;<br />(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;<br />(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">(v) Background:</span></p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) mission has expanded to encompass a broad range of studies aimed at understanding the structure and function of the human genome and its role in health and disease. NHGRI supports the development of resources and technology that will accelerate genome research and its application to human health. A critical part of the NHGRI mission continues to be the study of the ethical, legal and social implications (ELSI) of genome research. NHGRI also supports the training of investigators and the dissemination of genome information to the public and to health professionals. <br /><br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), NIH Intramural Sequencing Center (NISC) currently has four (4) Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencers, three (3) Illumina MiSeq sequencers and one (1) Pacific Biosciences RS II sequencer which are proven platforms for genetic analysis and functional genomics. The HiSeq 2500 sequencers were introduced at NISC in early 2011 and have been the primary sequencing data producers ever since. The system has advanced through numerous chemistry and software upgrades, but now has reached the limit of advancement. At this time NISC is also experiencing increased down time for the HiSeq 2500 sequencers due to an increase in break down on these aging instruments. NISC urgently needs to upgrade their sequencers in order to be able to properly support the NIH community. This is particularly critical since NISC is the only sequencing facility at the NIH currently certified to return clinically relevant exome sequencing data to patients. NISC seeks to acquire a more efficient, cost effective sequencer with a higher sample throughput.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose and Objectives</span>:</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), NIH Intramural Sequencing Center (NISC) needs to replace outdated DNA sequencers with new, more efficient and cost effective equipment. A key requirement is to reduce the instrument run time to improve sample turnaround times. Our current sequencers have a 7 day run time. NHGRI-NISC would like this reduced to 3.5 days and would like to increase data throughput from 1 Tb to 1.5 Tb per run. Since laboratory researchers work with precious samples of limited quantity it is important that protocols be robust and minimize the risk of cross contamination. As the cost of sequencing has dropped over the last decade it becomes more approachable to perform whole genome sequencing for individuals. A requirement for optimal read mapping to reference sequence is that the reads be long and paired. Paired reads are generated by obtaining individual reads from each end of the DNA fragments being sequenced. The pairing provides important quality information pertaining to the DNA preparation being sequenced and has advantages in mapping reads in areas where there are repeat sequences in the genome. The length of reads has been improving on all sequencing platforms. NISC requires paired-end reads where each read is at least 150 bases long for a total of 300 bases of data per DNA fragment.</p>
<p>The purpose of this proposal is for the Government to procure a cBot<sup>TM</sup> 2 Cluster Generation System and HiSeq&reg; 4000 Sequencing System, which is compatible with existing HiSeq and cBot Sequencer Systems already existing in the NHGRI-NIH Sequencing Center.</p>

<CONTACT>Kevin Newton, Email kevin.newton@tsa.dhs.gov
<DESC>(i) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. <br /><br />(ii) The solicitation number is HSTS05-17-Q-FLT005. The solicitation is issued as a request for proposal (RFP). <br /><br />(iii) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-92.<br /><br />(iv) This solicitation is set-aside for small business concerns. The associated NAICS code is 315990 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.<br /><br />(v) Contract Line Item Number 0001 Ballistic Panels 600 Each<br /><br />(vi) Description of requirements for the items to be acquired: Ballistic Panels. Technical requirements for the ballistic panels are included in the attached Statement of Work.<br /><br />(vii) Delivery of all ballistic panels shall occur within 30 days after receipt of order or by 31 Jan 17, whichever occurs first. FOB Destination to Egg Harbor Township NJ 08234.<br /><br />(viii) The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial applies to this acquisition. The following addends apply to the provision:
<p>- Paragraph (d) of the provision is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:</p>
<p>"<strong>Product samples are required</strong><strong>.</strong> <strong>Samples shall be sent to:&nbsp;COR Terrel Roberts, 601 South 12th Street, Arlington VA 22202.&nbsp; Samples shall be delivered and received by Mr. Roberts&nbsp;no later than 19 Dec 16.&nbsp; Please note that due to enhanced security measures, all packages shipped to&nbsp;TSA by the US Postal Service or shipping carriers (e.g. UPS, Fedex, etc.) undergo security screening which&nbsp;may delay receipt of samples submitted from dates guaranteed by the shipper.&nbsp; Please plan accordingly.</strong><br /><br />The Government requires 2 sample ballistic panels (at no expense to the Government) for necessary manufacturing design and inspection purposes. The samples will be used for technical evaluation and testing purposes, which may involve destructive testing. Using the evaluation process described herein, not all product samples may be tested. Product samples that have been tested will not be returned to the sender under any circumstance. Product samples that have not been tested may be returned at the sender's request and expense. Product samples will not count toward the final order quantities. "</p>
<p>(ix) The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation -- Commercial Items does not apply to the solicitation. The evaluation procedures to be used are as follows:</p>
<p>- Award will be made using the lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) selection process. Award may be made on initial quotations. Therefore, each initial quote should contain the quoter's best terms from a technical and price standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to contact quoters if it is later determined by the contracting officer to be necessary. The LPTA process will proceed as follows:</p>
<p>1) Quotes may be removed from consideration for any of the following reasons:</p>
<p>&bull; Quotes that are not received timely<br />&bull; Quotes that fail to follow the instructions in FAR Provision 52.212-1<br />&bull; Quotes that fail to submit any required documentation <br />&bull; Quotes that have language inconsistent with the terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation</p>
<p>2) Quotes will be ordered by price from lowest to highest.</p>
<p>3) The Government will then review Factor 1 of the lowest priced quote. If the review finds that Factor 1 of the lowest priced quote is acceptable, the Government will then evaluate Factor 2 of the lowest priced quote. If the review finds that Factor 2 of the lowest priced quote is acceptable, then the quote is techincally acceptable and the technical evaluation stops at this point.<br /><br />The Government will then evaluate Factor 3 of the lowest priced quote. If the review finds that Factor 3 of the lowest priced quote finds to be&nbsp;satisfactory, that quote represents the best value to the Government and the&nbsp;evaluation process stops at this point. <br /><br />Award of any quote is contingent upon a subsequent determination of price reasonableness and of contractor responsibility by the Contracting Officer.&nbsp; Upon such a determination,&nbsp;award will be made to the lowest-priced quoter without further consideration of any other quoters.</p>
<p>If the lowest quote is determined not to be acceptable for any reason, then the next lowest priced quote will receive an evaluation as described above. The process will continue (in order by price) until a quote from a responsible contractor is determined to be acceptable and priced fairly and reasonably.</p>
<p>4) USING THIS PROCEDURE, THE GOVERNMENT MIGHT NOT EVALUATE ALL QUOTES.</p>
<p>- Each Factor will be evaluated as follows:</p>
<p>Factor 1. Technical Acceptability</p>
<p>Past performance will be rated on an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" basis as follows:</p>
<p>Rating -&nbsp;Description<br />Acceptable - The quoted product meets all technical criterion stated in the Statement of Work.<br /><br />Unacceptable -&nbsp;The quoted product does not meet all technical criterion stated in the Statement of Work.</p>
<p>Factor 2. Past Performance</p>
<p>Past performance will be rated on an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" basis as follows:</p>
<p>Rating -&nbsp;Description<br />Acceptable -&nbsp;Based on the quoter's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the quoter will successfully perform the required effort, or the quoter's performance record is unknown. (See note below.)<br /><br />Unacceptable -&nbsp;Based on the quoter's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the quoter will be able to successfully perform the required effort</p>
<p>Note: In the case of a quoter without a record of relevant past performance, or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the quoter may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. Therefore, the quoter shall be determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, "unknown" shall be considered "acceptable."</p>
<p><strong>Note: Quoters are not required or requested to submit past performance references. The Government will use public and Government-restricted sources (e.g. PPIRS) to evaluate past performance.</strong></p>
<p><br />Factor 3. Price</p>
<p>Price will not be rated. Price analysis will be conducted to determine reasonableness.<br /><br />(x) Quoters are required to include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items with its quote.<strong> Quoters shall complete only paragraph (b) of this provision if they have completed the annual representations and certification electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM) Web site accessed through http://www.acquisition.gov . If the Quoter has not completed the annual representations and certifications electronically, it shall complete only paragraphs (c) through (q) of this provision.<br /></strong><br />(xi) The clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items applies to this acquisition. There are no addenda to the clause.<br /><br />(xii) The clause at 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes Or Executive Orders -- Commercial Items applies to this acquisition.

As used in this clause:<br />Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears.<br />Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.<br />Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)-<br />(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;<br />(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-<br />(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or<br />(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and<br />(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.<br />Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.<br />(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.<br />(1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:<br />(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or<br />(ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section 835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1). <br />(2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.<br />(3) Certain transfers disregarded.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. <br />Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed. <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>Ombudsman Notice</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

b). The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation -- Commercial Items. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.

Quotes will be evaluated for acceptability but not ranked using the non-cost/price factors. The following factors will be used to evaluate quotes:
All quotes shall be subject to evaluation by Government personnel. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions based upon the initial evaluation of quotes.  The proposal will be evaluated strictly in accordance with its written content.  Proposals which merely restate the requirement or state that the requirement will be met, without providing supporting rationale, are not sufficient.  Award will be made to Offeror whose price for items are lowest among all quotes that were deemed to be technically acceptable. Offerors who fail to meet the technical requirements of the solicitation will be rated Unacceptable and thus, ineligible for award.
Price:  
The Government anticipates that adequate price competition will establish a fair and reasonable price.  However, if the Government does not receive adequate price competition, it will evaluate price proposals to ensure price reasonableness of the products being provided to the Government, considering the specific terms and conditions and relevant commercial practices.
 Technical Qualifications for Blanks:  Granite: (pass/fail)
An experienced technical representative from the Memorial Programs Service (MPS), Program Support Office, will review the sample provided, in accordance with this solicitation, and the Statement of Work (SOW) instructions, and determine if the sample passes by evaluating a sample of granite as specified in the SOW for the following:
  Finish
  Dimension within tolerance
  Material meets ASTM criteria
  Color/reflectivity standard is met
  Workmanship free from defects 
Bonding within specs

Boring appropriately sized spaced

Past Performance: 
This factor will indicate Performance History/Experience in relationship to successful performance and ability to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation.  The Government may also obtain information from customers known to the Government, consumer protection organizations, and any other sources that may have useful and relevant information with regards to performance history/experience. If discussions are held, the Government will allow Offerors an opportunity to comment on any negative past performance information obtained by the Government. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  
To assist in this determination, Offerors are required to complete the Business Management Questionnaire, please see Attachment C.
Options. N/A 
A written and signed/dated, by the Contracting Officer, contract of award to the successful Offeror shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
Evaluation Process:  A Responsibility Determination will be made in accordance with FAR 9.1 Responsible Prospective Contractors.

(t) System for Award Management (SAM). (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <BR> <BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of Payment? paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <BR> <BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ``I agree'' click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ``click-wrap'' or ``browse-wrap'' agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u) (1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. (v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor's representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract. <BR> <BR>(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: (1) 52.209-10, Prohibition on Contracting with Inverted Domestic Corporations (Nov 2015).

<DESC>Notice modified to change Standard Service hours from M-F , 8am-5pm pst, to M-F, 8am-6pm local time.&nbsp; There are no other changes to this notice.<br /><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation number is NICHD-17-015a and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-92.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 811219 and the business size standard is $20.5m.  However, this solicitation is not set aside for small business.  This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to contract on a sole source basis with Illumina Inc., 5200 Illumina Way, San Diego, CA  92122 to procure a fixed priced one year service agreement for the following Illumina equipment:<br />1.	Product Care NextSeq&reg; 500 Sequencing system (SN: NB501202)  Comprehensive plan to include:  full coverage for parts, labor and travel; Reagent/kits replacement upon Hardware failures @ no charge, 1PM; Remote Technical Support; Service technician/personal shall acknowledge repair request w/in 24 business hours, priority scheduling for service calls , on-site responses shall occur w/in three business days when required, Hardware/Software updates: On-site applications support; advanced application training, Field Application Scientist Support -  Standard coverage hours/days are 5x18 (M-F, 8:00 am to 6:00 pm local time., excluding holidays) phone support and 5x24 email access to Technical Support.  Replacement parts/reagents and hardware/software updates/upgrades provided must be Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) certified.  Coverage period start date mid to late December 2016. <br />2.	Product Care NeoPrep<sup>TM</sup> Library Prep System Basic Plan (SN: NP00325) Basic Plan to include:  full coverage for parts, labor and travel; Reagent/kits replacement upon Hardware failures @ no charge: Remote Technical Support; Service technician/personal shall acknowledge repair request w/in 24 business hours, priority scheduling for service calls, on-site responses shall occur w/in five business days when required, Hardware/Software updates: On-site applications support; advanced application training -  Standard coverage  hours/days are 5x18 (M-F, 8:00 am to 6:00 pm local time, excluding holidays)  phone support and 5x24 email access to Technical Support.  Replacement parts/reagents and hardware/software updates/upgrades provided must be Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) certified.  Coverage period start date mid to late December 2016.
<p>Illumina is the sole provider of service for the Illumina pieces of equipment.  Only Illumina, Inc. has technical service representatives who receive comprehensive and on-going factory training and regular technical updates, as well as having direct access to original manufacturer's parts to help maintain the pieces of equipment in optimal condition. Illumina can engage directly with the engineers that designed the pieces of equipment to help resolve challenging technical support needs. <br />These pieces of equipment by virtue of their complex nature containing multiple individual components require regular maintenance as well as alignment and calibrations which can only be carried out by dedicated knowledgeable engineers trained specifically by the manufacturer, Illumina Inc. No other vendor has either access or has to ability to provide these specialized parts.  These pieces of equipment are mission critical for the scientific experiments undertaken in the individual laboratories where these devices are maintained in NICHD laboratories.  Furthermore, Illumina trains only their engineers on the functions and system control of all these integrated devices.  Illumina does not offer this training to anyone outside of their personnel resources.  The priority scheduling is very important for the proper upkeep and functionality of these pieces of equipment.  Thus, timely service is crucial in the functioning of these two pieces of equipment. Acquisition of service contract offering from other entities/third parties providers can lead to substantive problems getting timely service engineer dispatched and can lead to down times on devices.  NIH is a research organization where critical experiments require many weeks of tissue culture preparations and also in animal breeding programs, etc. thus such delays will impose a very large financial burden on research laboratories which are hurting for research funds in the first place.  Waste of experimental reagents, animals and human resources are the biggest problem in addition to reduction in research productivities.  <br />The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of the 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations however, all responses received, within twelve days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. <br />The offeror must include a completed copy of the provision of FAR Clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items with its offer.  The provisions of FAR Clause 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items; FAR Clause 52.212-2, Evaluation: The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The factors used to evaluate offers are (1) technical capability to provide all services/consumables, etc. outline above (2) price; and (3) past performance. Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.- Commercial Items; FAR Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items; and FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items - Deviation for Simplified Acquisitions applies to this acquisition.

<DESC>Notice modified to change Standard Service hours from M-F , 8am-6pm pst,  to M-F, 8am-5pm local time.&nbsp; There are no other changes to this notice.<br /><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation number is NICHD-17-017 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-92. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 811219 and the business size standard is $20.5m. However, this solicitation is not set aside for small business. This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13. Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to contract on a sole source basis with Illumina Inc., 5200 Illumina Way, San Diego, CA 92122 to procure a fixed priced one year service agreement for the following Illumina instruments:<br />1. Product Care HiSeq&reg; 2500 DNA sequencer (sn: D00762) Comprehensive Plan: Includes full coverage for parts, labor and travel; Reagent /kits replacement upon Hardware failures @ no charge, 1PM; Remote Technical Support; Service technician/personal shall acknowledge repair request w/in 24 business hours, priority scheduling for service calls , on-site responses shall occur w/in three business days when required, Hardware/Software updates: On-site applications support; advanced application training, Field Application Scientist Support - Standard coverage hours/days are 5x18 (M-F, 8:00 am to 5:00 pm local time, excluding holidays) phone support and 5x24 email access to Technical Support. Replacement parts/reagents and hardware/software updates/upgrades provided must be Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) certified. Coverage period start date mid to late December 2016.<br />2. Product Care MiSeq&reg; DNA sequencer (sn: M04210) Comprehensive Plan: Includes full coverage for parts, labor and travel; Reagent/kits replacement upon Hardware failures @ no charge: Remote Technical Support; Service technician/personal shall acknowledge repair request w/in 24 business hours, priority scheduling for service calls, on-site responses shall occur w/in three business days when required, Hardware/Software updates: On-site applications support; advanced application training - Standard coverage hours/days are 5x18 (M-F, 8:00 am to 5:00 pm local time, excluding holidays) phone support and 5x24 email access to Technical Support.

<p>Illumina is the sole provider of service for the Illumina pieces of equipment. Only Illumina, Inc. has technical service representatives who receive comprehensive and on-going factory training and regular technical updates, as well as having direct access to original manufacturer's parts to help maintain the instruments in optimal condition. Illumina can engage directly with the engineers that designed the instruments, to help resolve challenging technical support needs. <br />These instruments by virtue of their complex nature containing multiple individual components require regular maintenance as well as alignment and calibrations which can only be carried out by dedicated knowledgeable engineers trained specifically by the manufacturer, Illumina Inc. No other vendor has either access or has to ability to provide these specialized parts. These sequencers are mission critical for the scientific experiments undertaken in the individual laboratories where these devices are maintained in NICHD laboratories. Furthermore, Illumina trains only their engineers on the functions and system control of all these integrated devices. Illumina does not offer this training to anyone outside of their personnel resources. The priority scheduling is very important for the proper upkeep and functionality of these complex sequencers. Thus, timely service is crucial in the functioning of these two sequencers. Acquisition of service contract offering from other entities/third parties providers can lead to substantive problems getting timely service engineer dispatched and can lead to down times on devices. NIH is a research organization where critical experiments require many weeks of tissue culture preparations and also in animal breeding programs, etc. thus such delays will impose a very large financial burden on research laboratories which are hurting for research funds in the first place. Waste of experimental reagents, animals and human resources are the biggest problem in addition to reduction in research productivities. <br />The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of the 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations however, all responses received, within twelve days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. <br />The offeror must include a completed copy of the provision of FAR Clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items with its offer. The provisions of FAR Clause 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items; FAR Clause 52.212-2, Evaluation: The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The factors used to evaluate offers are (1) technical capability to provide all services/consumables, etc. outline above (2) price; and (3) past performance. Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.- Commercial Items; FAR Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items; and FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items - Deviation for Simplified Acquisitions applies to this acquisition.

Illumina does not offer this training to anyone outside of their personnel resources.  The priority scheduling is very important for the proper upkeep and functionality of these pieces of equipment.  Thus, timely service is crucial in the functioning of these two pieces of equipment. Acquisition of service contract offering from other entities/third parties providers can lead to substantive problems getting timely service engineer dispatched and can lead to down times on devices.  NIH is a research organization where critical experiments require many weeks of tissue culture preparations and also in animal breeding programs, etc. thus such delays will impose a very large financial burden on research laboratories which are hurting for research funds in the first place.  Waste of experimental reagents, animals and human resources are the biggest problem in addition to reduction in research productivities.  <br />The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of the 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations however, all responses received, within twelve days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. <br />The offeror must include a completed copy of the provision of FAR Clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items with its offer.

The factors used to evaluate offers are (1) technical capability to provide all services/consumables, etc. outline above (2) price; and (3) past performance. Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.- Commercial Items; FAR Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items; and FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items - Deviation for Simplified Acquisitions applies to this acquisition.

<DESC>The Research Vessel Acoustic Explorer (AX) is equipped with Detroit Diesel 16-V-92N engines. These engines are obsolete and are becoming increasingly more difficult to maintain. Caterpillar C32 ACERT diesel engines coupled with Twin Disc MGX5222 gear sets have been purchased to replace the existing engines. The purpose of this requirement is to identify the requirements and expectations for a skilled/experienced engineering and design services company familiar with engine replacement to create an acceptable drawing package for the replacement of the propulsion diesel engines on the AX.

<p>TITLE: Multi-Source Analysis (MSA)</p>
<p>ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial announcement</p>
<p>FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA-RIK-13-04</p>
<p>CATALOG OF FEDERAL DOMESTIC ASSISTANCE (CFDA) Number: 12.800</p>
<p>I. <strong>FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</strong></p>
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory is soliciting white p963369pers for various scientific studies, analytical tools, algorithm developments, projects, and experiments focused on developing Multi-Source, Activity-Based Analysis capabilities to provide the Air Force the means to better conduct Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR).</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The Processing and Exploitation Core Technical Competencies (CTC) mission is to lead the discovery, development, and application of technology to enable the processing and exploitation of multi-source ISR data for commanders, decision makers, and intelligence analysts. The volume of sensor data produced is enormous and still growing rapidly; however the ability to process and exploit this data has not been able to keep pace with the sheer volume of data produced. The Multi-Source Analysis (MSA) sub-CTC, which is the intended target of this Funding Opportunity, focuses on the creation of force multipliers for the ISR operators/analysts by developing automated processes to identify, extract, analyze, correlate, and sort multi-source data in order to classify and identify activities, entities and entity-relation networks in the battlespace. It also supports analysts in developing/maintaining more comprehensive situational awareness on an area of responsibility, as well as expertise on a topic in which they specialize. Multi-source exploitation and analysis capabilities are needed to turn data into information for the analyst. The key aspect is to provide automated capabilities to help the analyst more efficiently develop target sets, answer time-sensitive requests for information and produce intelligence analysis reports.</p>
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate (AFRL/RI) has an established test-bed facility that provides evaluation, assessment and demonstration of intelligence tools. The Automated Processing and Exploitation (APEX) Center provides a facility for algorithm development and evaluation, analytical studies, on-site and network distributed simulation exercises and demonstration of fusion technologies with real and simulated multiple source intelligence (multi-INT) data. Capabilities include scenario generation, and platform and sensor modeling. Simulators have been developed for various intelligence data types such as Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) information, electronic signals intelligence (ELINT) and measurement and signature intelligence (MASINT). Highly developed multi-INT data fusion systems are available for application to the problem of ground target tracking against a variety of operational scenarios. Analytical tools that quantify established measures of performance (MOPs) are available for target tracking and other applications. In total the APEX Center helps to facilitate a broad range of intelligence capabilities, and fusion technology development.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE:</p>
<p>The Information Directorate, Activity Based Analysis Branch, is soliciting white papers under this announcement for unique and innovative technologies to explore and develop network-centric, collaborative intelligence analysis capabilities that allows the fusion of multi-INT and data sources to enable accurate, shared, real-time intelligence products that locate and characterize entities, and tracks events, activities, and adversary networks. The key aspect is to provide automation capabilities for the analyst in the development of target sets and intelligence analysis reports. The three focus areas within MSA include: (1) Integrated Tracking, Analysis and Discovery (ITAD), (2) Multi-Source Information Extraction &amp; Analysis, and (3) Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Enterprise to the Edge (CETE). AFRL/RI intends to utilize the APEX Center capabilities to assist analytical studies, on-site and network distributed simulation exercises, and the processing of real-world, multi-INT data. The availability or use of Government Furnished Property/Government Furnished Equipment (GFP/GFE) will be determined on a contract-by-contract basis, but no GFP/GFE is anticipated at this time. Any GFP/GFE required by the offerors must be clearly identified in the submitted white paper.</p>
<p>Descriptions of Key Focus Areas:</p>
<p>1. ITAD intends to enable the analyst's ability to collect, characterize and locate activities and transactions. This includes identifying and locating actors conducting the activities and transactions, the networks of these actors, the relationships between networks, and the development of patterns of life (spatial and temporal motion statistics). ITAD seeks to develop automated processing and exploitation capabilities for activity based detection, normalcy and wide-area motion statistics. There are two major areas under ITAD: Motion Exploitation (ME) and Activity-Based Intelligence (ABI). ME includes automatic tracking and activity detection. ABI includes patterns of life, motion-augmented link and network discovery, and activity characterization. The specific technology areas of interest under these areas include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Automatic Tracking is developing technology to perform continuous tracking of objects through the use of multi-intelligence feature and contextual data from similar and dissimilar domains. Performance must be optimized across sensor variations, target densities, real time/forensic operations, automatic/operator in the loop control, and operational scenarios.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Activity Detection is developing automated techniques and tools to discover activity within the motion data (events, sequences, changes) to provide clues to analysts and for automated analysis. This spans individual activities (e.g. check point avoidance) through aggregate Area of Interest (AOI) -wide motion activities (e.g. traffic volume or full retreat).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wide Area Motion Statistics, characterizes and develops patterns of life in researching automated tools to exploit motion data including anomaly detection to characterize normalcy, finds origins and destinations, and relates statistical features to events.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Motion-Augmented Link and Network Discovery area develops algorithms to define and exploit multi-source networks representing adversary organizational structure and behavior.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Activity Characterization is researching techniques to dynamically update the assessment of insurgent activity with the probable intent, phase of operation, location, timing and participants associated with observed or detected activities and events. This will characterize and assess detected activity by combining kinematic analysis with behavior analysis and social network analysis for enhanced and timely situational awareness (SA).</p>
<p>AFRL/RI is soliciting innovative research white papers of interest to the Activity Based Analysis Branch for the specific technology areas listed above. Advancements are required to optimize performance, algorithm development, researching techniques and develop automatic techniques and tools.</p>
<p>2. Multi-Source Information Extraction &amp; Analysis capabilities allow for the efficient and effective exploitation of information that is contained within large volumes of structured, unstructured and semi-structured textual data. These data sets are very challenging to exploit as they can include material from many different sources, languages, genres and domains of interest and can be so vast that the application of automated analysis and visualization tools is necessary to have a chance at achieving a comprehensive understanding of the content. Employing Multi-Source Information Extraction &amp; Analysis capabilities greatly reduces the time it takes analysts to exploit these ever increasing volumes of textual data to produce reliable decision-making information. Addressing this textual data overload is a foundational component of the Secretary of Defense's "Data to Decisions" science and technology priority. The major areas within Multi-Source Information Extraction &amp; Analysis include: (1) Entity, Event &amp; Relationship (EER) Extraction; (2) Association &amp; Resolution (A&amp;R); and (3) Analysis &amp; Visualization (A&amp;V). EER addresses the extraction of entities, events and relationships from open source text, messages, reports, social media and structured databases such as transactions, communications, social relationships, sightings, and organizational structures. A&amp;R deals with multi-source/document data association and resolution as well as consolidation and association of data across disparate information sources using techniques such as standardization, normalization and probabilistic reasoning techniques. A&amp;V is developing algorithms for analysis and visualization of entities, events and relationships as they change over time. Parallelizable batch and real time graph analytic algorithms and heuristics to derive and maintain graph measures, graph matching and graph bundling to identify semantic and structural equivalences, and graph mining to discover new patterns of interest. The specific technology areas of interest under these areas include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EER Extraction: Data preparation (e.g. document zoning), smart filtering (e.g. document and corpus summarization), extraction of explicit and non-explicit entities, events, relationships and their attributes, within document entity and event co-reference, exploitation of idiosyncratic text types (e.g. micro text), sentiment analysis, domain customization and native foreign language exploitation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A&amp;R: Cross source entity and event resolution, data source alignment, hard/soft fusion, and deception detection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A&amp;V: Social network analysis, network analytics, pattern discovery, scalable algorithms, and novelty detection.</p>
<p>AFRL/RI is soliciting innovative research white papers of interest to the Activity Based Analysis Branch for the technology areas listed above, and their effective application to meet operator/analyst needs. Advancements are required to increase the speed, scalability and accuracy of textual analysis; to provide a greater depth of understanding of textual content, effectively map and link multiple concepts and relationships to increase comprehension and coordinate the derived knowledge across multiple intelligence media.</p>
<p>3. The C4ISR Enterprise to the Edge (CETE) program seeks innovative revolutionary solutions for processing closer to the sensors to minimize the latency of exploitation products associated with very high density and high throughput airborne sensors offsetting severe communication constraints by significant onboard computing capabilities. A strategic approach should take advantage of mission context and location specific exploitation, semi-automated and assistive methods to multiply analyst effectiveness and/or autonomous and dynamically steerable decision making algorithms. Fast and efficient summarization, indexing, storage, management, and delivery methods based on high performance computing are critical to this vision. Distributed computing models applicable to concurrent coordinated sensing, summarization of dynamic events, through multiple independently moving sensor platforms is critical to develop the next generation of persistent surveillance across large hostile areas. Evasive presence and opportunistic reach-back communication, and associated onboard processing are among the options. Future platforms will combine multiple independently moving passive and coordinated risk-managed active sensing including: video, hyperspectral, passive-radar, and quasi-passive multistatic synthetic aperture imaging, and must robustly address operations within a denied environment (Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD)) through stand-off surveillance and autonomous operations, taking advantage of dynamic awareness derived from other sources (SIGINT). A combined advantage of sensor-persistence, on-board storage, on-board computing, and intelligent exploitation algorithms will offer a wide range of solutions to effectively meet the mission requirements. Major areas under CETE include Context-Based Exploitation Architecture Designs (CBEAD), Information Management (IM), adaptive methods of latency minimization, Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR), Mapping of Key Algorithms on versatile architecture (MoKA) to deliver "code-once and run anywhere" capabilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The CBEAD area will focus on context specific exploitation algorithms including intelligent ways of estimating resource requirements impacting onboard realization of such exploitation algorithms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MoKA area will focus on developing approaches to map algorithms to on board processors of varied computational resources. The objective is to ensure that the algorithms can be effectively implemented on-board a platform within size, weight, and power (SWaP) restrictions. Furthermore, the developed solutions are required to meet the data storage requirements, and utilize computing methods to exploit both long-duration persistent data, and short-duration tactical data, while smartly adapting the computational effort to the required throughput.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The IM area is to ensure that the algorithms utilize big data solutions (e.g. Multidimensional Integrated Ontology (MDIO) and Managed Information Object (MIO)) that balance expressiveness with resource limitations. The IM effort will insure that the information produced by CETE can be effectively distributed across multisensory and multimodal assets, intelligently leverage database solutions and quickly disseminate products to a broad user community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The CBIR area is focused on developing exploitation algorithms that can detect, track, and identify targets of interest, monitor regions of interest, measure patterns of life, etc. from standoff-sensors. The intent is for the algorithm to be agnostic to the platform and sensor specifics and to produce low-bandwidth products that can be efficiently disseminated in real time to a broad user community. Method designs should push processing closer to the sensor to eliminate communication latency constraints, improve salient content, and enable robust mission solutions.</p>
<p>AFRL/RI is soliciting innovative research white papers of interest to the Activity Based Analysis Branch for the specific technology areas listed above and will span various maturity levels. Advancements are required to increase the speed of image-based analysis, provide a greater depth of understanding of image-based content, effectively map and link multiple concepts and relationships to increase comprehension and coordinate the derived knowledge across multiple intelligence media.</p>
<p>Solutions proposed for the above three areas will undergo testing, evaluation, integration, and verification in the APEX Center. The facility may be used to perform analysis for all efforts proposed under this BAA. The overall mission is to understand, measure, and advance the state of technology in the fusion of information. Offerors should consider any potential advancements that may be required for the APEX Center to support this BAA's 3 focus areas. If specialized modeling and simulation, scenarios for testing, analytical tools, algorithm developments, or new evolving metrics and evaluation standards are required in order for the Government to perform tasks within the APEX Center, include that information within the white paper.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Estimated Cost, Name/Address of Company, Technical and Contracting Points of Contact (phone, fax and email)(this section is NOT included in the page count); <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Section B: Task Objective; and <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Section C: Technical Summary and Proposed Deliverables.</p>
<p>Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror. If the offeror wishes to restrict its white papers/proposals, they must be marked with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a) and (b).</p>
<p>All white papers/proposals shall be double spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch. In addition, respondents are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number, their Dun &amp; Bradstreet (D&amp;B) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number, a fax number, an e-mail address, and reference BAA-RIK-13-04 with their submission. All responses to this announcement must be addressed to the technical POC, as discussed in paragraph seven of this section. The offeror must identify which focus area their white paper addresses upfront.</p>
<p>3. SUBMISSION DATES AND TIMES: It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award:</p>
<p><strong>FY 14 by 15 Dec 2013<br />FY 15 by 1 Mar 2015<br />FY 16 by 1 Mar 2016<br />FY 17 by 1 Mar 2017<br />FY 18 by 1 Mar 2018</strong></p>
<p>White papers will be accepted until 2pm Eastern Time on 28 Sept 2018 but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited. FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME. This BAA will close on 28 Sept 2018 at 2pm Eastern Time.</p>
<p>4. FUNDING RESTRICTIONS: The cost of preparing white papers/proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18. Incurring pre-award costs for ASSISTANCE INSTRUMENTS ONLY are regulated by the DOD Grant and Agreements Regulations (DODGARS).</p>
<p>5. CLASSIFICATION GUIDANCE FOR WHITE PAPER SUBMISSIONS: AFRL/RIEA will accept classified responses to this BAA when the classification is mandated by classification guidance provided by an Original Classification Authority of the U.S. Government, or when the proposer believes the work, if successful, would merit classification. Security classification guidance in the form of a DD Form 254 (DoD Contract Security Classification Specification) will not be provided at this time since AFRL is soliciting ideas only. After reviewing incoming proposals, if a determination is made that contract award may result in access to classified information; a DD Form 254 will be issued upon contract award. Proposers who intend to include classified information or data in their white paper submission or who are unsure about the appropriate classification of their white papers should contact the technical point of contact listed in Section VII for guidance and direction in advance of preparation.</p>
<p>6. All Proposers should review the NATIONAL INDUSTRIAL SECURITY PROGRAM OPERATING MANUAL, (NISPOM), dated February 28, 2006 and incorporating Change I, dated March 28, 2013, as it provides baseline standards for the protection of classified information and prescribes the requirements concerning Contractor Developed Information under paragraph 4-105. Defense Security Service (DSS) Site for the NISPOM is: http://www.dss.mil/.</p>
<p>7. OTHER SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: DO NOT send white papers to the Contracting Officer. <br />All unclassified responses to this announcement must be sent via U.S. Postal Service, registered mail and addressed to AFRL/RIEA, 525 Brooks Road, Rome NY 13441-4505, and reference BAA-RIK-13-04. Electronic submission is NOT authorized. Questions can be directed to the cognizant technical POC:</p>
<p>Adnan Bubalo <br />315-330-2991<br />Email: <a href="mailto:adnan.bubalo@us.af.mil">adnan.bubalo@us.af.mil</a></p>
<p>CLASSIFIED SUBMISSIONS MUST BE SENT TO AFRL/RIEA SEPARATELY FROM UNCLASSIFIED PAPERS AS PER THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW.</p>
<p>Use classification and marking guidance provided by previously issued security classification guides, the Information Security Regulation (DoD 5200.1-R), and the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (DoD 5220.22-M) when marking and transmitting information previously classified by another original classification authority. Classified information at the Confidential and Secret level may be mailed via U.S. Postal Service (USPS) Registered Mail and addressed to AFRL/RIEA, 525 Brooks Road, Rome NY 13441-4505, and reference BAA-RIK-13-04.

When mailing, ensure the response is appropriately marked, sealed, and mailed in accordance with the classified material handling procedures.</p>
<p>In the event of a possible or actual compromise of classified information in the submission of your white paper or proposal, immediately but no later than 24 hours, bring this to the attention of your cognizant security authority and AFRL Rome Research Site Information Protection Office (IPO):</p>
<p>Vincent Guza<br />315-330-4048 0730-1630 Monday-Friday<br />315-330-2961 Evenings and Weekends<br />Email: <a href="mailto:vincent.guza@us.af.mil">vincent.guza@us.af.mil</a></p>
<p><strong>DO NOT contact the IPO with technical questions, his role is to handle only security breaches.<br /></strong><br />V. <strong>APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION</strong>:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: Proposals will be evaluated through a peer or scientific review process using the following criteria, in which criteria (1) through (3) are of equal importance and criteria (4) is of lesser importance than criteria (1) through (3), to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- The approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology including technical feasibility, degree of innovation, understanding of the technical and operational approach for evaluation of the technology; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged, the ability to share and change software, and the appropriate technology relative maturity (e.g., accuracy, timeliness, confidence, throughput, reliability, and robustness); The potential for AFRL to transition the research and development deliverables to future Government needs. Any proposed restriction on technical data or computer software will be considered. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).</p>
<p>No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: (a) Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; (b) Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and (c) Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>3. ADEQUATE PRICE COMPETITION: The Government may simultaneously evaluate proposals received under this BAA with a common cutoff date for multiple offerors. In this case, the Government may make award based on adequate price competition, and offerors must be aware that there is a possibility of non-selection due to a proposal of similar but higher-priced technical approach as compared to another offeror.</p>
<p>4. FEDERAL AWARDEE PERFORMANCE AND INTEGRITY INFORMATION SYSTEM (FAPIIS) PUBLIC ACCESS: The Government is required to review and consider any information about the applicant that is in the FAPIIS before making any award in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold (currently $150,000) over the period of performance. An applicant may review and comment on any information about itself that a federal awarding agency previously entered. The Government will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in FAPIIS in making a judgment about the applicant's integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 2 CFR &sect; 200.205 Federal Awarding Agency Review of Risk Posed by Applicants and per FAR 9.104-6 FAPIIS.</p>
<p>VI. <strong>AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</strong>:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.<br />All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after white paper/proposal submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS: Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a Top Secret facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to Top Secret information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility such as the AFRL Rome Research Site APEX Center located in the Corporate Collateral Facility to support work under this BAA. This acquisition may involve data that is subject to export control laws and regulations. Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) at <a href="http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/">http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/</a> and have a legitimate business purpose may participate in this solicitation. For questions, contact DLIS on-line at <a href="http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp">http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp</a> or at the DLA Logistics Information Service, 74 Washington Avenue North, Battle Creek, Michigan 49037-3084, and telephone number 1-800-352-3572. You must submit a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your proposal.</p>
<p>3. Data Rights: The potential for inclusion of Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or data rights other than unlimited on awards is recognized. In accordance with (IAW) the Small Business Administration (SBA) SBIR Policy Directive, Section 8(b), SBIR data rights clauses are non-negotiable and must not be the subject of negotiations pertaining to an award, or diminished or removed during award administration. Issuance of an award will not be made conditional based on forfeit of data rights. If the SBIR awardee wishes to transfer its SBIR data rights to the Air Force or to a third party, it must do so in writing under a separate agreement. A decision by the awardee to relinquish, transfer, or modify in any way its SBIR data rights must be made without pressure or coercion by the agency or any other party. Non-SBIR data rights less than unlimited will be evaluated and negotiated on a case-by-case basis. Government Purpose Rights are anticipated for data developed with DoD-reimbursed Independent Research and Development (IR&amp;D) funding.</p>
<p>4. REPORTING: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Contract Applicable: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be given complete instructions on the submission process for the reports. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. FAPIIS Applicable: As required by 2 CFR 200 Appendix XII of the Uniform Guidance and FAR 9.104-6, non-federal entities (NFEs) are required to disclose in FAPIIS any information about criminal, civil, and administrative proceedings, and/or affirm that there is no new information to provide. This applies to NFEs that receive federal awards (currently active grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts) greater than $10,000,000 for any period of time during the period of performance of an award/project.</p>
<p>5. NOTICE: The following provisions* apply:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) FAR 52.209-07, Information Regarding Responsibility Matters<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) FAR 52.209-11, Representation by Corporations Regarding Delinquent Tax Liability or a Felony Conviction under any Federal Law <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) DFARS 252.203-7996, Prohibition on Contracting with Entities that Requirement Certain Internal Confidentiality Agreements-Representation <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d) DFARS 252.204-7008, Compliance with Safeguarding Covered Defense Information Controls <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (e) DFARS 252.239-7017, Notice of Supply Chain Risk<br />* Please note that the current versions or deviations of the related clauses will be included in any resulting contract.</p>
<p>6.<strong> GRANT AWARDS ONLY</strong>: For efforts proposed as grant awards, offerors must provide an abstract in their proposal (not to exceed one page) that is publicly releasable and that describes - in terms the public may understand - the project or program supported by the grant. If the proposal is selected for award, the DoD will publically post the abstract to comply with Section 8123 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2015 (Pub. L. 113-235).</p>

<DESC><br /><strong>AMENDMENT 2 for BAA AFRL-RIK-2016-0010</strong>
<p>The purpose of this Amendment to BAA AFRL-RIK-2016-0010 is to make the following changes:</p>
<p>1) SECTION I, "Funding Opportunity Description": Focus Area - Multi-Domain Command and Control is revised. A detailed attachment on this focus area has been added to this synopsis. Also a specific point of contact (POC) this area has been added;</p>
<p>2) SECTION III, "Eligibility": Updated to include access restrictions for foreign nationals; and</p>
<p>3) SECTION IV, "Application and Submission Information": Revised to establish a FY17 submission date for the Multi-Doman Command and Control focus area.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CHANGE SUMMARY:</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) SECTION I, "Funding Opportunity Description". The following Focus Area is revised to read as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Multi-Domain Command and Control.</strong> The goal of this focus area is to enable the USAF to operate in the highly constrained, multi-domain environments of the future. <br /><br /><strong>See Attachment 1 to this synopsis for complete details on this focus area.</strong> <br /><br />Technical POC for this focus area: Aaron W. McVay <a href="mailto:aaron.mcvay.3@us.af.mil">aaron.mcvay.3@us.af.mil</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) SECTION III, "Eligibility Information" is deleted in its entity and replaced with the following:</p>
<p><strong>III. ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION:</strong></p>
<p>1. ELIGIBILITY: All qualified offerors who meet the requirements of this BAA may apply.</p>
<p>2. FOREIGN PARTICIPATION/ACCESS:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. <strong>This BAA is closed to foreign participation at the Prime Contractor level.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Foreign Ownership, Control or Influence (FOCI) companies who have mitigated FOCI&nbsp;may inquire as to eligibility by contacting the contracting office focal point, Gail E. Marsh, Contracting Officer, telephone (315) 330-7518 or e-mail <a href="mailto:Gail.Marsh@us.af.mil">Gail.Marsh@us.af.mil</a> for verification prior to submitting a white paper. Please reference BAA AFRL-RIK-2016-0010.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Contractor employees requiring access to USAF bases, AFRL facilities, and/or access to U.S. Government Information Technology (IT) networks in connection with the work on this contract <strong>must be U.S. citizens</strong>. For the purpose of base and network access, possession of a permanent resident card ("Green Card") does not equate to U.S. citizenship. This requirement does not apply to foreign nationals approved by the U.S. Department of Defense or U.S. State Department under international personnel exchange agreements with foreign governments. Any waivers to this requirement must be granted in writing by the Contracting Officer prior to providing access. The above requirements are in addition to any other contract requirements related to obtaining a Common Access Card (CAC). If an IT network/system does not require AFRL to endorse a contractor's application to said network/system in order to gain access, the organization operating the IT network/system is responsible for controlling access to its system. If an IT network/system requires a U.S. Government sponsor to endorse the application in order for access to the IT network/system, AFRL will only endorse the following types of applications, consistent with the requirements above:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Contractor employees who are U.S. citizens performing work under this contract.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Contractor employees who are non-U.S. citizens and who have been granted a waiver.</p>
<p>Any additional access restrictions established by the IT network/system owner apply.</p>

<p>1. SUBMISSION DATES AND TIMES: It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award:</p>
<p><strong>FY17 by 06 Jan 2017 for the Multi-Doman Command and Control Focus Area</strong></p>
<p>FY18 by 30 April 2017<br />FY19 by 30 April 2018<br />FY20 by 30 April 2019<br />FY21 by 30 April 2020</p>
<p>White papers will be accepted until 2 PM EST on 30 Sep 2021, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited. This BAA will close on 30 Sep 2021.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the TPOC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the TPOC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after submission.</p>
<p><strong>No other changes have been made.</strong></p>

<p><br /><strong>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE (SSN)<br /></strong><br />TITLE: Abrams Engine Diagnostic and Troubleshooting Trainer (ED/TT) <br />Response Date: <strong>29-April-2016</strong><br />Classification Code: 69 - Training Aids and Devices<br />NAICS Code: 333318 <br /><br /><strong>*</strong>This SSN is a follow on of previous FBO&nbsp;notices for&nbsp;Solicitation Number <span style="text-decoration: underline;">STOC-II-15-OPD-0010<br /></span><br /><strong>Description:<br /></strong>The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Program Manager Training Devices (PM TRADE), Project Manager for Ground Combat Tactical Trainers (GCTT) is contemplating a new acquisition for an upgrade of the existing Abrams M1A1 Engine trainers at Ft. Benning, GA., Ft. Lee, VA., and Gowen Field, ID., to the M1A2 System Enhancement Package (SEP) version 2 (v2) configuration. These trainers are required to support the Program of Instruction (POI) for the 91A, 913A and 915A Military Occupational Specialties (MOSs). This trainer is expected to provide training in diagnostic and troubleshooting tasks of the Abrams M1A2 SEP v2 electronics, cables and Line Replaceable Units (LRUs). This development is expected to improve the existing trainer's design in the area of monitoring of student actions and progress and automation of trainer initiation, lesson execution and student scoring. <br />A driver's compartment design shall be updated to more closely replicate the tank driver's compartment and internal components. Student ingress and egress shall approximate the tactical tank.<br />Line Replaceable Units (LRUs), cables, and software will be utilized in the upgraded trainer design. The upgrade should utilize current and emerging technologies to provide the required training capability. This SSN solicits industry's feedback for trainer development and procurement strategy. <br />PEO STRI is currently developing its acquisition approach as well as the Period of Performance (POP) of the contract. It is contemplated that this award will be made through the Best Value Trade Off approach in accordance with FAR 15-101. This acquisition will require access to information classified as "Sensitive but Unclassified" or "For Official Use Only". <br /><br /><strong>Background:</strong><br />The Engine Trainer has been a part of the United States Army Ordnance Center and School (USAOC&amp;S) for the last 30 years, early 1980s. The program was developed to improve Soldiers proficiency to maintain the Full-Up Power Pack (FUPP-engine and transmission) and engine systems management. The Engine Trainer has become a major part of training for the M1 Abrams series tank. The Engine Trainer consists of three-pieces: FUPP, Engine Stand, and Driver's Compartment. The Stand is comprised of two (2) pieces: Engine and Driver's Station Stand. This gives the student access to the system with ease during their diagnostics and troubleshooting tasks. An analog fault insertion training box is configured with single pole/double throw (SPDT) switches to enable the instructor to initiate faults in performance of training lessons. The trainer is located in a fixed site facility with all safety aspects such as external exhaust plenum and carbon monoxide sensors and other features for safe operation.</p>
<p>There are currently nine (9) Engine Trainers and two (2) Live Engines: seven (7) Engine Trainers in use at Ft. Benning, GA., and two (2) Engine trainers in use at Ft. Lee, VA. There is currently one (1) Live Engine at Ft. Lee, VA., and one (1) Live Engine at Gowen Field, ID. <br />The nine (9) Engine Trainers are in the M1A1 configuration. Faults are inserted through the use of an instructor control panel that includes three position double throw switches to insert faults. The design includes a Full Up Power Pack (FUPP), a Driver Station frame, and a FUPP stand. The FUPP consists of the engine and transmission. The Driver's Station consists of a frame resembling the driver station where LRUs are mounted. This includes the Digital Electronics Control Unit (DECU), Driver's Master Panel (DMP), Driver's Instrument Panel (DIP), Driver's Alert Panel (DAP), Throttle control and Shift Selector Assembly (SSA). The FUPP stand consists of the mount for the FUPP, the fuel tank, Battery Box and the electrical interface panel. The FUPP is mounted on a hard stand and requires a forklift to drag it out from under the exhaust vent. Tactical cables are utilized with the excess rolled up and lying on the floor exposed.<br />The two (2) Live Engines are currently being used as ground-hopped training aids.</p>
<p><strong>Performance Objectives:<br /></strong>The performance objectives shall be IAW the attached ED/TT SOW, SRD and CDRLs.</p>

<DESC>The Pre-Solicitation Notice originally issued on Apr 2, 2016 as stated in paragraph 6. SET-ASIDE INFORMATION, and all subsequent amendments issued thereto, is hereby changed to read as follows:

This procurement is a 100% Total Set-Aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) AE firms under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541310, Architectural Services (Small Business Size Standard $7.5 Million).  Verification of SDVOSB status will be done via confirming current registration in the Center for Veterans Enterprise   Vendor Information Pages database (vip.vetbiz.gov). The Government intends to make five (5) awards to SDVOSB AE firms. The awarded contracts will be firm-fixed price Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ). The IDIQ contracts will be for one base year from the date of award with option to extend the term of the contracts up to four (4) additional one year periods to be exercised at the discretion of the Government, or until the maximum contract amount of $12,000,000.00 awarded across all IDIQ contracts is reached, whichever is earlier.  Each contract awarded will have a guaranteed minimum order of $1,500.00 for the total of the base year and all option years.  The minimum value of any individual Task Order is $2,500.00 with a maximum Task Order value of $1,000,000.00.  Each specific IDIQ Task Order shall be competitively selected and separately negotiated based on the A/E effort involved.

All non-SDVOSB firms who submitted SF330 qualification packages via the original Pre-Solicitation notice and any modifications thereto are by virtue of the above set-aside change considered non-responsive and ineligible for further consideration. 

All non-SDVOSB firms who submitted SF330 qualification packages via the original Pre-Solicitation notice and any modifications thereto shall not request nor shall they receive debriefs. 

There is no extension to the date for providing SF330 qualification packages as stated in the original Pre-Solicitation Notice and any modification thereto, therefore no additional SF330s shall be submitted nor shall they be accepted. 

Due to the fact Stage I Source Selection is complete, SDVOSB AE firms who submitted SF330 qualification packages are not permitted to submit updates or changes.

<DESC>PR-ORD-16-01065: Two Month Extension to EP-D-11-058 - Facilities Operation &amp; Maintenance Support Services
<p>Intent to Sole Source:<br />NAICS Code: 561210 Facilities Support Services.  The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has a requirement for continuation of services under the current contract, EP-D-11-058, as described below.  EP-D-11-058 expires on January 31, 2017.  The Government intends to compete, negotiate, and award follow on services to this contract for a base and four option periods in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).  However, the contract for follow on services will not be awarded prior to the expiration date of EP-D-11-058.  The services under this contract are critical and cannot lapse.  The EPA intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, with Native Energy &amp; Technology, Inc., 110 Broadway St Ste 320, San Antonio, TX  78205-1960 and exercise FAR clause 52.217-8 -- Option to Extend Services to extend services under this contract, not to exceed two additional months of service, until such time that the competition for the follow-on Facilities Operations &amp; Maintenance (O&amp;M) Support Services contract is completed and a follow-on contract is awarded.</p>
<p>Native Energy &amp; Technology, Inc. (NET) currently provides the stated facilities O&amp;M support services (scheduled preventive maintenance and repair, janitorial services, grounds maintenance services, guard services, and other services including pest control, elevator maintenance, solid waste removal, copier maintenance, etc; materials and repair parts associated with scheduled preventive maintenance; and unscheduled repair materials and subcontractor labor for unscheduled repairs) for the EPA's Office and Research and Development (ORD) National Exposure Research Laboratory (NERL), Ecosystems Research Division (ERD) ORD-Athens Laboratory (ORD-Athens) facilities located at 960 College Station Road, Athens, GA 30605-2700, under contract EP-D-11-058 and has provided these services and support under said contract since April 2011.  The continuity that NET's services will provide are critical to ORD research priorities and to ensure continuity of research.</p>
<p>There are no other entities that have the capability of providing the level, breadth, and depth of support that are required by the ORD-Athens Laboratory facility in order to maintain a fully functioning facility with the least amount of disruption in a short period of time on a temporary basis.</p>
<p>NET is best suited for continuing to provide the above indicated services and support for the requested four month extension as they have the necessary infrastructure, personnel, supplies, and subcontractors already in place, fully functioning, and doing so will guarantee continuity of services for the ORD-Athens Laboratory facilities while the Government completes the competition for the follow-on Facilities Operations &amp; Maintenance (O&amp;M) Support Services contract is completed and a follow-on contract is awarded.</p>
<p>The Government is not stating that there are no other contractors who can support this facilities O&amp;M support services requirement.  The Government understands that there are other companies that provide similar facilities O&amp;M support services.  The Government is instead saying that considering the short period of performance contemplated within this extension and that the actual base and four option period follow on contract award will be competed amongst eligible, qualified companies, that no other contractors could transition this workload from NET and efficiently continue performance without potential reduced services, increased costs, and unnecessary risks to the Government.  This two-month extension of services is not an attempt by the Government to limit competition to the incumbent contractor but to provide additional time to complete the evaluation of proposals received and the award of a follow-on contract.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR Part 5.207(c)(16)(ii), all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the Agency.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon response to this notice, is solely within the direction of the Government.</p>
<p>This notice will be posted for 15 days.</p>
<p>The intent of this synopsis is to state the Government's intention to sole source this requirement and to determine if any other source(s) exist; and, therefore, no solicitation is available.  All interested parties who believe they can provide the required service should 1) fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing and submit same via FedConnect, a government web portal, within 15 days from the date of this announcement; and 2) must submit itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.</p>
<p>Consequently, any responder(s) failing to provide the aforementioned data but instead choosing merely to submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will not be honored.  Offerors must submit all technical questions / responses concerning this synopsis electronically through FedConnect at www.fedconnect.net/Fedconnect/.  This notice and any amendments will be available via the Internet at the following URL:  www.fedconnect.net/FedConnect/ .  You must register with FedConnect as an interested party to submit questions and to view responses.  Vendors can register with FedConnect at www.fedconnect.net/FedConnect/.

  Potential vendors are hereby notified that the solicitation and subsequent amendments to the solicitation will ONLY be available for download at the above web sites.  This office will no longer issue hard copy solicitations.  By submitting a quote, the vendor will be self-certifying that neither the requestor nor the principal corporate officials and owners are currently suspended, debarred, or otherwise ineligible to receive contracts from any federal agency.  Failure to do so may represent grounds for refusing to accept the quote.  Through its submission, the vendor acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation, except for award to foreign vendors for work to be performed outside the United States.
  Lack of registration in the SAM database will make a vendor ineligible for award.  Vendors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-999-227-8220, or via the Internet at http://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/.  Please direct all questions regarding this requirement to William S. Powell at william.s.powell@navy.mil.

Justification and Approval (J&A)
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition (>$150K)

Acquisition Plan Action ID:  VA255-16-AP-3941

Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 15

Maintenance and repair service contract for the Varian Clinac Accelerator and its components at John Cochran division, St. Louis VA Medical Center.
2237:  657-17-1-1110-0011

Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  

The Contractor shall supply all labor, travel, materials, equipment, tools, supervision, and all incidentals required to complete on-site full service planned maintenance and corrective maintenance for the Varian Clinac Accelerator high energy x-ray machine and its components.  This will be a Firm Fixed Price contract for one year + 2 option years.  $178,578 per year; total value $535,644.00.

Name of proposed Contractor:  
Varian Medical Systems, Inc.
3100 Hansen Way
Palo Alto, CA 94304-1030

Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency s Needs:  

This is a justification for soliciting one source, Varian Medical Systems, Inc., for the services required to maintain the Clinac Accelerator and its components.  Varian s Clinac products utilize proprietary Varian technology.  Varian s service and support training, procedures and documentation are intellectual property of Varian and are proprietary.

Contract period:  December 1, 2016 to November 30, 2017 with two additional option years.

Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  

 ( X )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
        Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
 (  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
 (  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
         or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
 (  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
 (  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
 (  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
 (  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

Demonstration that the Contractor s Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   

Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1.  The Varian Clinac Accelerator system utilizes proprietary software and only Varian technical support personnel are certified to service the Varian Medical Systems, Clinac Accelerator and its proprietary operating software.  In an effort to ensure proper patient care, it is within the best interest of the government to ensure these critical pieces of equipment are maintained and repaired to meet all OEM specifications.  Based on previous procurement history and the proprietary nature of the requirement, there is not a reasonable expectation that offers will be received from two or more eligible SDVOSB s, VOSB s or any other SB concern.

Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  

A Sources Sought notice was posted to FBO on October 5, 2016 and Varian Medical Systems and The Remi Group, LLC, a large business, replied.  The Remi Group, LLC, noted that they provide services that manage the maintenance of multiple equipment types under one fixed-price agreement.  While these services are available from this contractor on a GSA contract (GS-21F-0093V), The Remi Group, LLC is a third party, and the end user would be required to go through their call center.  Accordingly, the manufacturer would not directly work with the end user.  There is only one linear accelerator at the John Cochran VA Medical Center, and continuing to work with Varian Medical Systems will allow for more prompt service when the accelerator is down and emergency service is needed.   

Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  

The cost associated with this service, estimated to be $178,548.00 per year, is deemed to be fair and reasonable after looking at similar awarded contracts in FPDS.  Also, the St. Louis VAMC has acquired these services from Varian since 2013 and the price has remained consistent.

Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  

Market research was conducted in an attempt to identify open market competitors that could provide the required services.  VetBiz.gov, AbilityOne, GSA, SBA were searched to confirm whether any other vendors could perform services related to the proprietary equipment.  The market research performed shows that no other vendors are certified or authorized to service the Varian equipment.  FPDS searches for the Clinac Accelerator services were all found to be awarded to Varian by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  

Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  

N/A

Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  

         Varian Medical Systems and The Remi Group, LLC.  

A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  

This equipment utilizes unique technology.  The manufacturer will specify hardware and software support since the software is proprietary.  The option of product replacement exists, but the equipment has not reached its end of life.  Re-procuring in an effort to avoid proprietary issues and expand the competitive field would result in a substantial duplication of cost.

Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

JUSTIFICATION
FOR AN EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY

1.  Contracting Activity: Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) 
                                          Office of Acquisition Operations
             Technology Acquisition Center
             23 Christopher Way
             Eatontown, NJ 07724
            
2.  Description of Action:  This proposed action is for a firm-fixed-price delivery order issued under the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement (SEWP) V Government-Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) for the renewal of brand name Entrust certificate subscription licenses and software maintenance.

3.  Description of the Supplies or Services:  For several years, VA suffered from various migration issues with its escrowed Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) encryption certificates.  Specifically, VA experienced issues maintaining several contracts with different vendors to provide migration services, and in that, VA experienced significant problems executing the migration of escrowed encryption certificates, to include failures to migrate escrowed encryption certificates.  To address the PKI encryption and migration issues, VA determined it was in its best interest to enter into an Interagency Transaction with the Department of Treasury (Treasury) in accordance with applicable regulations and procedures.  The current Interagency Transaction with Treasury, effective July 2016, provides PKI services for VA in support of a Shared Service Provider (SSP).  As an SSP for PKI services, the Treasury s Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD) provides PKI support services to VA.  For about four years, VA has held agreements with BPD to install, operate, and maintain a PKI enrollment server which provides VA with the ability to issue web and device based PKI and encryption certificates to users across VA enterprise.  VA, Office of Information and Technology, Service Delivery and Engineering, Enterprise Systems Engineering, Core Infrastructure Services has a requirement to renew 550,000 brand name Entrust Entelligence Security Provider User Client Access Licenses (CALs) to include software maintenance, 500,000 Entelligence Security Provider for Devices User Identity CALs to include software maintenance, and 400,000 Web Certificates (no maintenance) to support the Interagency Transaction.  These subscription licenses allow VA a limited web based PKI administration platform for the issuance and management of end entity certificates within VA enterprise.  The required certificate authority administration software subscriptions include capabilities for auto enrollment, user management and user registration and enrollment server for the web management of encryption certificates.  VA must renew these licenses in order for BPD as a SSP to provide PKI services for VA.  The Contractor shall also provide software maintenance to include 24 hours per day, 7 days per week technical phone support, software patches, bug fixes, and version upgrades.  The period of performance shall be December 5, 2016 through December 4, 2017, plus two 12-month option periods, if exercised.  
                        
4.  Statutory Authority:  The statutory authority permitting this exception to fair opportunity is 41 U.S.C. 4106(c)(2) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.505(b)(2)(i)(B), entitled  Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized. 

5.  Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:  Based on market research, as described in section eight of this justification, it was determined that limited competition is viable among authorized resellers of the required brand name Entrust certificate subscription licenses and software maintenance.  VA has a critical need to continue the existing license subscription with Entrust.  Entrust is the current software that the BPD uses for its entire customer base, which includes VA.  VA utilizes BPD as a SSP for its PKI services and Entrust is the only software that is interoperable and compatible with the existing BPD Entrust SM8 software currently installed in BPD s PKI management environment.  BPD currently utilizes Entrust SM8 software and VA needs to communicate with that software and can only use Entrust certificate subscription licenses due to the proprietary code that only allows Entrust certificates to be issued from the Entrust software that BPD hosts.  Any other product, other than Entrust, would not communicate and work with the existing BPD Entrust SM8 software.  VA requires Entrust certificate subscription licenses for continued operational availability.     

Maintenance is required for software updates and patches to VA s current Entrust software.  These updates and patches provide new feature sets, address program errors in prior software versions, and provide security enhancements.  Only Entrust, through an authorized reseller, can provide the necessary software upgrades and patches because of the propriety source code required to develop and implement software updates.  Since the software is proprietary, a legal restriction is placed on access to the software code that is required in order to develop upgrades and patches to the software.  Without this access it is impossible for another source to modify the software code as necessary to provide the required patches and upgrades.  No other source other than an Entrust authorized reseller can provide the required maintenance support requirements described herein, such as assistance via phone and email, as well as all software upgrades and patches.  

Failure to renew the existing Entrust certificate license subscriptions will cause PKI services in VA (email encryption/Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card issuance/Secure websites) to be invalidated because the Entrust licenses are the only ones that are interoperable with the current system.  This will cause integration for other Veteran Focused Integration Program (VIP) deliverable items, such as PIV card management system (CMS) activities that support Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) mandates for PIV cards to be severely disrupted.  The services that will cease to function will leave VA without a PKI provider.  Failure to procure Entrust PKI software licenses will cause systems that use security certificates and encryption to go offline, resulting in outages that will cause access failures to VA IT systems to include medical systems, which will cause patient safety incidents.  

6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  Market research was conducted, details of which are in section eight of this justification.  This effort did not yield any additional sources that can meet the Government s requirements.  It was determined, however, that limited competition is viable among authorized resellers for the required Entrust software license subscription and maintenance renewals.  In accordance with FAR 5.301 and 16.505(b)(2)(ii)(D), the award notice for this action will be synopsized and this justification will be made publicly available on the Federal Business Opportunities Page within 14 days of award of the order.  Additionally, in accordance with FAR 16.505(a)(4)(iii)(A)(2), this justification will be provided with the Request for Quote to NASA SEWP V GWAC holders.

 7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  The Government will continue to conduct market research to ascertain if there are changes in the market place that would enable future actions to be competed.  VA technical Subject Matter Experts regularly review industry trade publications and conduct internet research to ascertain if any other software is available to meet the requirements described herein.

8.  Market Research:  The Government s technical experts conducted market research in August of 2016 by reviewing similar software products to ascertain if these items could meet VA s requirements.  Specifically, the Government s technical experts conducted web-based research from Verisign, Inc., Verizon Communications, Symantec Corporation, and SafeNet, Inc. as other PKI providers.  VA reviewed each of the possible sources  product information and it was determined that only Entrust meets VA s requirements.  All other PKI providers use a different PKI vendor suite that is incompatible with the current BPD environment consisting of Entrust SM8 software.  Furthermore, no other vendor, including those reviewed by the technical experts, has the capability of issuing software patches, bugs, fixes, and version upgrades for Entrust certificate subscription licenses necessary to support the existing VA requirement.  Based on the above, only Entrust certificate subscription licenses and software maintenance meet all of the Government s requirements.

Additional market research was conducted in October 2016 by utilizing the NASA SEWP Provider Lookup tool to determine whether the brand name Entrust certificate subscription licenses and software maintenance are available from NASA SEWP V GWAC holders.  It was determined that there are several resellers of the brand name Entrust certificate subscription licenses and software maintenance that hold current GWACs such that limited competition is anticipated.
