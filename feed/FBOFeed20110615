<DESC>The Air Armament Center, Long Range Systems Division, MALD Branch, intends to award a three year sole-source IDIQ contract under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 to Raytheon Missile Systems (Tucson, AZ) for program support of the Miniature Air Launched Decoy (MALD) and MALD Jammer (MALD-J) programs. The contract maximum value is estimated to be $40 million. Raytheon Missile Systems is the only known company that has the detailed knowledge necessary to provide this required MALD/MALD-J specific support. No government owned technical data package exists to provide to other companies. <br />This support is for non-routine engineering support activities that are not within the scope of the current development or production contracts. Types of effort that may be ordered under this IDIQ contract include, but are not limited to: Support of the Government's Operational Safety, Suitability and Effectiveness (OSS&amp;E program), procurement of Range Safety Systems (RSS), Reliability Assessment Program (RAP), Support of Initial or Follow-On Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) activity, MALD/MALD-J/MALD-J Increment II manufacturing risk mitigation, and additional Explosive Ordinance Disposal, mission planning software support, non-warranted assessment and repair, and taskings that cannot be funded under Interim Contractor Support or Contractor Logistics Support.
<p>The only known responsible source that can satisfy these requirements is Raytheon Missile Systems (RMS) the original MALD producer and sustainment provider because it solely possesses the critical vehicle information and qualified vehicle design to meet Government's requirements. No technical data package is available from the Government. FAR 5.207(c)(15)(ii) requires that all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. All responses must be received 15 calendar days after date of post. The AFFARS clause 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, is applicable to this procurement. The Ombudsman is Colonel David Harris, AAC/CV, at 101 West D Avenue, Suite 116, Eglin AFB FL 32542-5495, (850)-882-5422. For any technical issues, contact Rob Cooney, (850) 883-3490. For contractual issues, contact Colin McCranie, 205 West D Avenue, Suite 633, Eglin AFB FL 32542-6864, or e-mail colin.mccranie@eglin.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>This is the formal synopsis for the sources sought synopsis, FA8250-10-A-F16PR that was posted on 15 June 2010.<br /><br />Solicitation Number: <br />FA8252-11-R-50027
<p>Description: F-16 INITIAL PROVISIONING AND SPARES</p>
<p>The 748 Supply Chain Management Group (SCMG) intends to issue a solicitation for the purpose of identifying potential sources capable of providing F-16 initial provisioning data, spares and support equipment, at all supply and maintenance levels during aircraft production. The Government will not reimburse any costs for providing any information, documentation, and/or data submitted or preparation costs for submittals in response to this solicitation. In addition, the Government<br />will not pay for any costs associated with participation in demonstrations. Initial responses are due to this solicitation by 5 September 2011.</p>
<p>This contract is to define, develop, and purchase initial provisioning documentation and recommended initial provisioning spares to support the F-16 aircraft. Provisioning documentation includes predictable and unpredictable data. It secures supplies and data for modification programs, and new systems as they are included on the aircraft. These initial efforts will support the end items at the least cost to the Government until follow-on replenishment spares can be procured.<br />The solicitation number for this acquisition is FA8252-11-R-50027 and is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP). This solicitation is to be awarded Sole Source Firm Fixed Price repair contract to Lockheed Martin Corporation, DBA Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company (LM Aero), Lockheed Blvd, Fort Worth, TX 76108-0000, CAGE Code 81755. The North American Industry Classification System is 336413. The Statutory Authority permitting other than full and open competition is: 10 U.S.C. 2304(C)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1-Only One or Limited Responsible Sources and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed. The above authority was selected because LM Aero is the only known source with technical data and manufacturing experience for F-16 initial provisioning and spares.</p>
<p>The period of performance will consist of a five (5) year basic. The estimated award date is 19 December 2011 with performance and delivery through 18 December 2016. The total contract period will not exceed five (5) years.</p>
<p>The USAF is issuing this request in an effort to identify contractors who are qualified to conduct the following tasks:<br />Develop a capability to define, develop, and deliver initial provisioning documentation and recommend initial provisioning spares to support the F-16 aircraft. The contractor shall prepare provisioning documentation using the Logistics Support Analysis 036 format (LSA-036) format and delivered to 418 SCMS/GULAAC via the D220 Mechanized Provisioning System, which is the sole initial provisioning archive database for the USAF and our customers. This will require the contractor to be able to establish their database and systems with interface capability with the government systems. The contractor shall compute the recommended spares quantities to initially support the USAF and its customers and include the data in the provisioning documentation.</p>
<p>The contractor must have the capability to access the F-16 design history, baseline, or the necessary F-16 engineering data for all aircraft models, in all of the World-wide configurations. The government cannot presently provide that data. Companies responding must describe how they will obtain and/or develop the necessary data. The contractor must be able to utilize this data to develop engineering changes, provide data, and deliver the resulting recommended spares lists required for initial provisioning spares.<br />To be eligible for contract award, offerors must be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) prior to solicitation closing date. Register via the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov. Contractors must also submit their representations and certifications at the online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) website at https://orca.bpn.gov.</p>
<p>The solicitation will be issued on or about 2 July 2011, and will be available to view and download on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website: http://www.fbo/gov/. PAPER COPIES OF THIS SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE MAILED. The solicitation will close on or about 5 September 2011. Be sure to check the solicitation after issuance to verify the correct proposal response date. All amendments will be posted on the FBO website as well as the date and time. All prospective offerors are responsible to visit the web page frequently and obtain the solicitation and any amendments or other information pertaining to this solicitation. No telephone calls or written requests for this solicitation package will be accepted.</p>

<DESC>Item: 0001B-1  Strategic Action and Investment Plan

This soliciation will be a logical Follow on to a GSA contracGS-10F-0233V

The B-1 achieved Initial Operational Capability in 1986 and is scheduledto remain in service with the Air Force through at least 2040.  Many of the systems in the B-1 are original equipment and suffer fromsustainability shortfalls which impact reliability, availability andmaintainability (RAM) and the ability to reduce total ownership costs (TOC).  Operational capabilities of theB-1 are also beginning to reflect a gap in required capability versuswhat the platform is capable of providing the Combatant Commander.  These capability gaps may also bemore critical based on potential future mission tasks.  In light of these factors and in preparation for FY14 POM, Air CombatCommand is developing a strategic, long range vision for the B-1.  The B-1 2012 - 2025 Roadmap (Oct 2007) will form the foundation forthis strategic vision.  The 2014 to 2040 Strategic Action and InvestmentPlan will consider current system programmatic, operational, and sustainment realities as a baseline.  The updated Strategic  Action and Investment Plan will consider themethodology used in preparing the 2007 Roadmap then provide ananalytically supportable set of required operational capabilities and improved, sustainable system for thewarfighters.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command  Picatinny has a requirement for a modification to the Spider Contractor Logistical Support (CLS) contract W15QKN-08-C-0517.  It is the Governments intent to solicit, negotiate and award on a sole source basis to the Spider Joint Venture (JV) of Alliant Techsystems, Inc. and Textron Systems Corp under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.
FAR 6.302-1 is considered applicable as the effort being acquired represents a bridge effort between the System Development and Demonstration and Low Rate Initial Production Phase of the Spider Program and commencement of full rate production.  The JV is the only contractor capable of performing this bridge effort as award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays resulting in a discontinuation of CLS.  The period of performance for this extension will be approximately four and a half months. 
No Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued with respect to this procurement. This is a notice of intent and not a request for competitive proposals.  Questions shall be submitted in writing to the U.S. Army Contracting Command  Picatinny, Attn: Maria Robertson, Contract Specialist, at maria.robertson@us.army.mil.

<DESC>This announcement has three DRAFT SCREENING INFORMATION REQUESTS (SIR) attached covering the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) requirements for the National Security Officer Program.   The FAA is not seeking or accepting proposals (solicited or unsolicited) at this time.
The FAA Air Traffic Facility Security Risk Management office has a requirement for security officer services throughout the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii and U.S. Territories.  These services are being procured in order to provide physical security safeguards for FAA employees, facilities, and United States Government property and assets from loss, theft, damage, unauthorized use, criminal acts, espionage, sabotage and terrorism. 
The FAA intends to issue a separate SIR for each Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Service Area (SA): Eastern Service Area (ESA), Central Service Area (CSA) and Western Service Area (WSA).  It is intended that these solicitations will be considered for award based on the tiered evaluation method discussed below.  Based on market analysis, there are a significant number of small businesses capable of covering the requirements nationwide.  The FAA has a non-binding goal of awarding at least two of the three SA awards to small businesses, with the possibility of all three SA awards being made to small businesses.   The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code anticipated to apply to this effort is 561612 Security Guard and Patrol Services with the size standard of $17 Million.
In order to provide opportunities for small businesses and to ensure that FAA requirements are met, the acquisition strategy for this procurement is anticipated to use a tiered evaluation of offerors with the following tiers:
I.	8(a) CompaniesII.	SDVOSBIII.	Small BusinessesIV.	Large Businesses
Where:(1) Tiered evaluation of offers is a process by which FAA promotes small business participation while providing FAA a means to continue the procurement if small business participation is insufficient.
(2) The FAA may use tiered evaluation of offers to promote competition in each tier of small business concerns while still allowing other than small business to participate without issuing another SIR.
(3) The FAA will consider the tiers of small business concerns prior to evaluating offers from other than small business concerns.
All business classifications will be encouraged to submit offers for these SIRs.  It is intended that the FAA will proceed with the evaluation of offerors and award within the lowest tier found to contain adequate competition among technically acceptable offers.
It is intended that an offeror be considered as a prime contractor for only one SA award but have the ability to pursue subcontracting opportunities on other service area awards without restriction.
The three SA contracts under this acquisition are intended to be Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (FFP IDIQ) with one Time and Material (T&M) Contract Line Item (CLIN) and a period of performance of one base year and four one year options anticipated to begin on April 01, 2012.
PURPOSE:The Purpose of this public announcement is to request comments on the attached draft SIRs, and the acquisition strategy for this requirement.  Additionally, the FAA desires to inform industry of the below bidder's information session.
The FAA will host its annual National Small Business Procurement Opportunities Training Conference and Trade Show on July 18, 2011 - July 21, 2011, in Atlantic City, NJ.  There will be a National Security Officer Program Overview on Monday, July 18, 2011, from 2:15 - 4:15 p.m.  Attendance is not required in order to participate in the subsequent solicitation.
Interested parties may use the link below to register:
http://www.faa.gov/news/conferences_events/small_business_forum_2011/

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.<br />The COAC Services Branch, Office of Acquisitions, DERA, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), NIH, intends to negotiate with Affymetrix, Inc 3420 Central Expwy, Santa Clara, CA 95051, for the following services outline in the statement of work.
<p><br />The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees. This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13. However, this solicitation is not set aside for small business.</p>
<p><br />Background:</p>
<p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and serious illness in the United States. In 1948, the Framingham Heart Study -- under the direction of the National Heart Institute (now known as the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; NHLBI) -- embarked on an ambitious project in health research. At the time, little was known about the general causes of heart disease and stroke, but the death rate for CVD had been increasing steadily since the beginning of the century and has become an American epidemic.</p>
<p>The objective of the Framingham Heart Study was to identify the common factors or characteristics that contribute to CVD by following its development over a long period of time in a large group of participants who had not yet developed overt symptoms of CVD or suffered a heart attack or stroke. The Framingham Heart Study continues to make important scientific contributions by enhancing its research capabilities and capitalizing on its inherent resources. New diagnostic technologies, such as echocardiography (an ultrasound examination of the heart), carotid-artery ultrasound, bone densitometry (for monitoring osteoporosis), and computerized tomography of the coronary arteries, are evaluated and integrated into ongoing protocols.</p>
<p><br />Product:</p>
<p>1. Item Number: 900651, Array Human Exon, 1.0 ST 30/PG, quantity 65 BX<br />2. Item Number: 900720, RGT, Kit HYB Wash stain 30 RXN, quantity 65 KT <br /><br />I. Contractor Requirements:<br /><br />A. Contractor will provide the gene chips and reagents to analyze 1950 blood samples <br />B. The Contractor will provide the necessary technical support during the sample processing step and the required internal controls for use as a quality control measure.</p>
<p>II. Government Responsibilities:<br /><br />A. NHLBI will inspect each chip and reagents to determine if the supplied buffers are adequate for processing 1950 samples.</p>
<p>III. Reporting Requirements and Deliverables:</p>
<p>A. Prepared cDNA targets from the 1950 samples in NHLBI for concentration and integrity using a spectrophotometer and bioanalyzer.<br />B. Samples that have passed the QC would be hybridized to gene chips for further analysis.<br />Spiked in internal controls supplied by the contractor would be used to determine QC and technical variability</p>
<p><br />The delivery point is the National Institutes of Health, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Framingham MA.</p>
<p>The Government=s anticipated delivery date is twelve months after receipt of purchase order.</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on the fact that Affymetrix is the only known source capable of providing the required supplies, and are the only items that are compatible with government-owned Affymetrix equipment. A change in the product would affect ongoing laboratory research and threaten the investment already made.</p>
<p>The notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p><br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis, by June 28, 2011, 7:30am Eastern Standard Time. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Inquires to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NHLBI-CSB-(HL)-2011-174-DDC, may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisition, Procurement Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6042, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, Attention: Deborah Coulter.

<DESC>This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice. The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) NOAA Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC) is seeking a contractor to (1) Provide three fishing vessels (including crew) for up to 45 days per quarter to conduct a pilot fishery independent survey for bottomfish in waters around Oahu and Maui using local fishing vessels, (2) expand the State of Hawaii's bottomfish tagging program to include other areas and species, (3) network with local fisherman and industry to expand fishery dependent sampling of bottomfish at major landing ports and/or auctions throughout the Main Hawaiian Islands (MHI), and (4) assist with logistics to discuss progress of the projects with local constituents, including the fishing and scientific communities.
<p>The fishery independent pilot survey constitutes a feasibility study, and data from the survey will be used to determine optimal gear(s), sample sizes, and number of vessels needed to implement fishery independent surveys in the Hawaiian Archipelago, Guam, CNMI and American Samoa. The contracted vessels shall have, in proper working order, all required USCG approved safety, navigation and communication devices. Captains of contracted vessels must have sufficient experience with bottomfish fishing in the Hawaiian Archipelago.<br />Data from the tagging study will provide growth and movement data to advance the development of species specific models, as well as our understanding of connectivity. Current length and weight sampling of bottomfish catch in the MHI occurs only at the United Fish Auction (UFA) in Honolulu. A significant amount of catch is also landed and sold at landing ports and/or auctions on islands other than Oahu. Because the growth of individual bottomfish species differs between islands in the MHI, the length structure of the catch from the UFA is not representative of other areas. Data from this study will allow for the development of spatially explicit models and biological reference points. The meetings are an effective way of communicating progress, while at the same time promoting open communication and trust with local fisherman and scientists.<br />REQUIREMENT<br />The Contractor shall furnish the necessary vessels, personnel, equipment, and services (including all bottomfish fishing gear, bait and insurance for the vessel and the ship's personnel) to perform the statement of work/specifications shown below. <br />- Provide three (3) fishing vessels (including crew) to conduct fishing operations for 45 days each quarter year at selected sites in waters around Oahu and Maui. In addition, contract at-sea technicians (scientific personnel) to collect scientific data while at sea. The Captains of contracted vessels must have sufficient experience with bottomfish fishing in the Hawaiian Archipelago. Vessels must be capable of housing 1-2 scientific personnel and crew for the duration of the fishing trip.</p>
<p>- Provide additional fisherman to tag and release bottomfish during regular fishing operations following standardized protocols. A key-species list will be provided to each contracted vessel along with tags. While conducting fishing operations throughout the contract period, fish will be tagged and released by the crew and requisite information recorded (e.g., tag number).</p>
<p>- Identify a network of bottomfish landing ports in the MHI to conduct length and weight sampling. Assist with the development and implementation of sampling protocols to collect length and weight data and contract technicians or fishermen to collect these data.</p>
<p>- Periodically conduct constituent meetings to discuss progress of the projects.</p>
<p>This will be a Firm Fixed Price type contract. The Period of performance is for a one (1) year period. The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 541990 with a size standard of $7.0 Million. Request for Proposal (RFP) solicitation documents may be available on or about July 1, 2011 at the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps or FBO) website: http://www.fbo.gov/. The ESTIMATED response due date is&nbsp;Aug 1, 2011; however, the actual date offers are due will be stated within the solicitation documents. Paper copies of this solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>The proposed contract is unrestricted. Interested parties should use the FedBizOpps [Add To Watchlist] and [Add Me To Interested Vendors] features which provide a notification when the RFP becomes available for download as well as all postings of information associated with this solicitation, thereafter. Each potential offeror is responsible for checking the FedBizOpps website to gain all current information related to the solicitation. The solicitation and any further announcements regarding the solicitation will be posted only at http://www.fbo.gov/. All questions of any nature regarding this procurement are to be sent in writing to Contract Specialist, Levis Knox at Levis.D.Knox@noaa.gov.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Air and Radiation (OAR), in Washington DC, intends to award a Purchase Order to Aprovecho Research Center, Aprovecho Institute, of Cottage Grove, OR, under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The purpose of this follow-on purchase order is to allow Aprovecho to complete the scheduled training and field study in Bangladesh and the final report comparing the results of the three project sites for peer reviewed publication.The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541990.    NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE.   It has been determined that Aprovecho Research Center is uniquely qualified to satisfy the Government?s requirement, based on the following reasoning:
1)	This project is three quarters complete.  Three project sites have been competitively solicited, evaluated and selected -- Rwanda, Laos and Bangladesh.  Two of the three trainings (in Rwanda and Laos) have been completed.  In careful and on-going consultation with the contractor and local field staff, taking into account field conditions and staff availability, the third and final training is scheduled for June/July 2011 in Bangladesh.  The stoves from Rwanda and Laos have been shipped, delivered and tested in the Aprovecho laboratory.  
2)	EPA has already invested 75% of the funds in the contract, to develop the training materials, select the project sites, complete two of the three workshops, field studies and lab tests, and prepare two of the project reports.  A new contractor would need to start over to prepare training materials, train field staff, solicit study sites, purchase testing equipment, and design and implement field and laboratory studies to assess the performance of cook stoves for publication.  This would require substantial time and cost to EPA.  
3)	Aprovecho has the intrinsic knowledge, as well as the equipment and data from the first two field sites, to complete this study, compile and analyze the data from the three study sites, and submit the results for publication in a peer reviewed journal.  They will be able to complete the remaining tasks in the original scope of work over the next five months.

Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting EPA?s requirement, as stated herein, may submit their corporate capabilities, which, if received by the response date of this announcement, may be considered.  Responses to this posting must be in writing and submitted to Benita Jackson, Contracting Officer, to Jackson.benita@epa.gov.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All questions should be directed to Benita Jackson, Contracting Officer, via e-mail to Jackson.benita@epa.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The fixtures will be large stand lights - approximately 6' tall - and will replicate the originals that were designed for the building in 1915. Pieces of the original fixtures are located in the basement of the building; the intent of the project is to reuse as much of the original fixtures as possible, but additional new pieces will need to be fabricated since some of the originals have been lost or damaged. The original pieces will also be refinished. </span>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'">The project involves design work for determining the final fixture design. We have several historical photos and a very good idea of how the pieces of the fixtures fit together, but we will be relying on the expertise of the contractor's qualified lighting firm to definitively find the answer. The contractor will also be responsible for fabricating and installing the fixtures and providing their electrical infrastructure. </span></p>

<DESC>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), located on the National Naval Medical Center (NNMC) in Bethesda, MD, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with The rSmart Group, Inc., for a three (3) year (base period of 12 months + 2 option periods of 12 months each) purchase order to provide ongoing support for its current rSmart CLE version of Sakai. In 2010, rSmart implemented its modified version of the Sakai Open Source Learning Management System as USUHS. The rSmart version of Sakai, which is available through the rSmart website, modifies and integrates the Sakai Community releases. USUHS is currently operating rSmart CLE version 2.7 and intends to upgrade to 2.8 when released this summer by rSmart. USUHS seeks subscription support for 8,000 user licenses to include Tier 1-3 support, knowledge-base access and the Icodeon SCORM-compliant player.<br /><br />This service will be procured in accordance with the procedures of FAR Part 12 - Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisition Procedures.

<p>(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available.</p>
<p>The mission of USUHS is to provide the highest quality education programs in the health sciences to those selected individuals who demonstrate dedication to a health profession career in the Uniformed Services. As such, it is essential USUHS provide the necessary services required for our students to become successful doctors and nurses and to be able to provide the best care possible for our soldiers.</p>
<p>USUHS completed its migration from Blackboard to Sakai in May 2011. USUHS created 389 new course sites and 94 new project sites to support courses provided by the School of Medicine, Graduate School of Nursing and Graduate School. The rSmart CLE version of Sakai is central to the implementation of the School of Medicine Curriculum Reform, which impacts the Class of 2015, for whom classes begin in August 2011. USUHS Sakai implementation is integrated with LDAP, JASIG CAS, Kuali Rice, and the USUHS Registrar System. USUHS summer courses began at the end of May and pre-fall courses for the Graduate students commence in July. USUHS implementation of Sakai operates on two (2) Red Hat servers, is managed through an Application Data Controller. USUHS requires a system that is integrated with Kuali, Registrar systems, LDAP and CAS.</p>

<DESC><strong>This is a Small Business Sources Sought Notice.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding:&nbsp; (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; veteran owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of the proposed acquisition.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Your response in the form of a Capability Statement tailored to the purpose/objective and project requirements as identified in this notice, will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible</strong>.&nbsp; An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should NOT submit a response to this notice.<br /><br />BACKGROUND<br /><br />The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) provides national leadership and administration of a program which enhances the quality, appropriateness, and effectiveness of health&nbsp;care services.&nbsp; AHRQ accomplishes this mission through the establishment of a broad base of scientific research and through the promotion of improvements in clinical practice and in the organization, financing, and delivery of health care services.<br /><br />Within AHRQ, the Center for Primary Care, Prevention and Clinical Partnership (CP3), has primary responsibility for promoting research targeted to improve the quality, efficiency and effectiveness of primary health care services.&nbsp; CP3 is the home of AHRQ's Prevention and Care Management Portfolio.&nbsp; This portfolio fulfills AHRQ's Congressional mandate to provide scientific, technical, administrative, and dissemination support of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPST or Task Force), an independent panel of experts that makes evidence-based&nbsp;recommendations on clinical preventive services for primary care clinicians.&nbsp;&nbsp; All the Center's efforts are aimed at improving accessibility to primary care services as well as assuring that the care is patient-centered, team-based, coordinated, and of high quality and safe.&nbsp; CP3 accomplishes its mission through awarding research grants and contracts and through collaborative efforts with private and Federal partners. <br /><br />PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES:<br /><br />The purpose of&nbsp;the proposed&nbsp;acquisition is to manage the AHRQ primary care resident rotation program which offers residency rotations for preventive medicine, family practice, obstetrics and gynecology, and pediatric physicians-in-training, as well as for allied health professionals with advanced public health degrees (e.g., nurse practitioners or physician assistants).&nbsp; The clinical rotation at AHRQ gives residents an in-depth experience in the process of developing evidence-based recommendations.&nbsp; Residents work closely with AHRQ staff on a variety of activities, including:&nbsp; conducting literature reviews; researching information on epidemiology and burden of preventable conditions; reviewing and editing evidence-based reviews of clinical preventive services; reviewing and summarizing and editing evidence-based reviews of clinical preventive services; reviewing and summarizing and editing evidence-based reviews of clinical preventative services; reviewing and summarizing external comments on draft USPSTF recommendations; researching the position of other organizations on relevant clinical preventive services topics; reviewing and editing USPSTF recommendations and rationale statements; and the development of implementation materials for clinical recommendations aimed at patients, clinician, health plans, employers and policy makers.&nbsp; Residents also have the opportunity to participate in a variety of AHRQ meetings, conferences and seminars, including USPSTF meetings, as well as didactic teaching and journal club sessions focusing on current issues in clinical preventive medicine and evidence-based research.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rotational opportunities are offered by AHRQ on an annual basis to align with the academic calendar (e.g., July 1, 2012 through June 30, 2013).&nbsp; The proposed acquisition is for a single year with the option to extend annually for up to four additional years.&nbsp;&nbsp; AHRQ may choose to host any combination of number of residents in varying numbers of months in rotation, for up to a total of 12 months (for example:&nbsp; 4 residents in 3-month rotations or 6 residents in 2 month rotations, no individual rotation will be shorter than 2 month's duration.<br /><br />PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:<br /><br />A key role of the Contractor is to conceptualize and execute -- with AHRQ approval-- widespread advertising and promotion of the rotational opportunities offered by AHRQ to primary care residency programs (including preventive medicine, family practice, obstetrics and gynecology, and pediatrics) and the residents themselves, in order to maximize awareness and participation.&nbsp;&nbsp; The use of multiple forms of media is favored for this approach.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;Contractor will be required to provide AHRQ with a detailed marketing and promotion plan describing how it will engage and recruit primary care resident applications for approval.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The contractor will also coordinate and facilitate the resident application&nbsp;process, by serving as the central administrator for resident applicant submissions.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Contractor will serve as the first point of contact for any questions about the&nbsp;application process and the AHRQ primary care rotation.&nbsp; The Contractor shall be responsible for answering resident's logistical questions regarding the application process and will facilitate resident's communications with&nbsp;AHRQ as needed regarding questions about the substance of the rotational experience.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;Contractor will ensure that residents can successfully submit applications&nbsp; for the program and that received applications are complete. The Contractor&nbsp;will forward all applications to AHRQ who will be responsible for the review and selection of residents for rotation slots.&nbsp; The Contractor will execute the acceptance/rejection notification process with individual residents and residency programs.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Contractor shall notify&nbsp;residents of the selection and the proposed dates for&nbsp;the rotation.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Contractor shall also notify applicants that were not selected for a rotation.&nbsp; The Contractor will facilitate -- with approval from AHRQ-- any alterations to the rotation schedule requested by residents.<br /><br />The Contractor will serve as the primary facilitator between AHRQ, accepted residents, and their institutions.&nbsp; The Contractor will provide and process payments for resident stipends and a residency program administrative fee, as well as resident travel reimbursements, when required.&nbsp; Stipends may be&nbsp;paid directly to the residency program.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Contractor will also facilitate completed rotation evaluations and other documents and&nbsp;paperwork as required by the resident's academic institutions.&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS:<br /><br />The Contractor should have established relationships with preventive medicine, family practices, obstetrics and gynecology, and pediatric residency programs across the nation, or the ability to implement a clearly defined plan by which the Contractor could be expected to rapidly (i.e., within 6 months) develop such relationships with residency programs, in order to ensure broad dissemination and uptake of the opportunity by residents.<br /><br />The Contractor should have demonstrated experience in personnel recruitment activities, including experience in coordinating and facilitating a centralized, on-line application process, as well as the acceptance/rejection notification process.<br /><br />The Contractor should be able to demonstrate experience in customer service, in terms of timely, helpful assistance and responses to customer queries.<br /><br />The Contractor should have the capacity to independently carry out financial transactions with individuals and educational institutions (such as electronic transfers, deposits, or withdrawals), or a clearly defined plan by which the Contractor can rapidly acquire such a capacity.<br /><br />The Contractor should also have a general knowledge of government travel regulations.<br /><br />The Contractor should have a general knowledge of medical fields with a focus on primary care (including preventive medicine, family medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, and pediatrics).<br /><br />It is expected that key personnel for this effort should have a minimum of a 4-year college degree;&nbsp;it is preferred that at least one person have specialization in communications or marketing, and another have experience in human resources. <br /><br />ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:<br /><br />The anticipated period of performance is July 2012 through June 2013 with four one-year options. <br />

The E-4B is a fleet of 4 highly modified Boeing 747-200s. Due to the small fleet size, aircraft availability is of primary importance to the E-4B community and should be thoroughly considered by prospective offerors.</p>
<p>The E-4B serves as the National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) for the National Command Authorities (NCA) and provides a worldwide-deployable, enduring node of the National Military Command System (NMCS) to fulfill national security requirements throughout the full spectrum of conflict. It is a modern, highly survivable, command, control and communications center to direct U.S. forces, execute emergency war orders and coordinate civil authorities' activities, including national contingency plans. The E-4B has a variety of communication and cryptographic equipment to provide connectivity within the radio spectrum from Very Low Frequency (VLF) to Extremely High Frequency (EHF).</p>
<p>Proposed upgrades will further improve and modernize onboard capabilities and provide opportunities for future technology insertion. They will support the President of the United States (POTUS), Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) and senior leaders' contingency operations, and routine communications during all mission profiles. In addition, they will provide enhanced, flexible systems for securing data, video and voice recognition-quality communications for both onboard and offboard worldwide connectivity through replacement, modification, or addition of E-4B mission systems that includes commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and software.</p>

A Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) line item will be added to the contract for engineering and technical support efforts related to manufacturing/production of systems, such as, IATO, frequency authorizations, analysis of frequency data for PM Radars use in obtaining these approvals.  Anyone interested in reviewing this specification shall forward their company name, address, CAGE code, point of contact to include name, title, telephone number and e-mail address to Christopher.M.Fisher24.civ@mail.mil (443-861-4768).  Company information will be verified via the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.  If you're registered in this database, access to this specification will be granted.  The Government possesses no technical data package for the LCMR Program. <br><br>Item Definition:  The LCMR AN/TPQ-48A and AN/TPQ-49 are lightweight, 360-degree, rapidly deployable, man-transportable, digitally connected, day/night mortar locating radars that use computer-controlled signal processing of the radar signal data to perform target detection, verification, tracking, and classification of enemy and friendly mortars.  The systems consist of an Antenna and Radar Cylinder that is powered by battery or external generator.  Data processing is performed by the Radar Processor (RP) and Portable Display Unit (Laptop).  <br><br>The current LCMR Systems are being produced by SRCTec, North Syracuse, NY and have demonstrated the following:  Range and Accuracy Performance in an Actual Environment of 100m TLE (50% CEP) from 1km out to 5km on 60mm, 81mm, 120mm Mortars. <br><br>Other considerations:  PM Radars is seeking potential respondents who can demonstrate the existing LCMR functionality to provide these systems within 9 months of any contract award.  Schedule is of the utmost importance to PM Radars.<br>

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health, Clinical Center is conducting a market survey/sources sought to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZONE small business capable of serving the needs mentioned below. This market survey/sources sought announcement is not a request for proposals and the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement. The information from this market research is for planning purposes only and will assist the Government in planning its acquisition strategy. This is strictly market research and the Government will not entertain questions concerning this market research. The Government will not pay for any costs incurred in the preparation of information for responding to this market survey. 


Background

The mission of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is to uncover new knowledge that will lead to better health for everyone. The NIH accomplishes that mission by conducting research in its own laboratories; supporting the research of non-Federal scientists in universities, medical schools, hospitals, and research institutions throughout the country and abroad; helping in the training of research investigators; and fostering communication of biomedical information.

The NIH Clinical Center (CC) is a 234-bed federally funded, biomedical research hospital located on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland. The Clinical Center is the delivery setting for all NIH intramural clinical research protocols. The hospital complex consists of two main facilities that are connected to each other by bridges. The original 14-story building is 2.5 million square feet and continues to house the clinical laboratories, imaging sciences, surgical suites, and several outpatient clinics.  The new 870,000 square foot facility houses inpatient units and day hospitals.  The Clinical Center accounts for about half of all NIH-funded clinical research beds in the United States and accommodates about 7,000 inpatient and 70,000 out-patient visits a year. Patients are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center from all over the world for the sole purpose of participating in a clinical research protocol.

The Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences (RAD&IS) provides imaging services to the CC patients who participate in research protocols conducted by the various NIH institutes.  Imaging services include X-rays, fluoroscopy, mammography, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, computed tomography (CT) scans and interventional radiology (special procedures).  Diagnostic services in ultrasound, digital mammography, positron emission tomography/computed tomography  (PET/CT), and nuclear medicine are also provided. All these diagnostic modalities generate clinical diagnostic images that are sent to and archived on the RAD&ISs Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS).   The departmental radiologists review the diagnostic images and dictate clinical findings using a Voice Recognition system (VRS).  The findings are saved in reports which are stored in the RAD&ISs Radiology Information System (RIS) and forwarded to the Clinical Research Information System or the Clinical Centers Hospital Information System (CRIS).

 
Purpose

This request is for the purchase of the first option year of a multi year service agreement with Carestream Health Inc. for the continued maintenance of the Clinical Centers Picture Archiving and Communications System (PACS).

<DESC><p>Introduction</p>
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice."</p>
<p>The information from this market research will help the DMID, NIAID, NIH, and DHHS, plan their acquisition strategy. Please be sure to indicate if you have a GSA schedule contract, a contract on GSA 8(a) STARS, or a contract on GSA VETS GWAC.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>Research supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), strives to understand, treat, and ultimately prevent the myriad infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases that threaten millions of human lives. The NIAID Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) supports extramural research for the investigation, control and prevention of diseases caused by all infectious agents other than HIV. Support for basic and applied research to develop and evaluate therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics is provided through a variety of research grants and contracts. DMID also supports an array of research resources and services to assist investigators, including programs that provide or make available genomic data and technologies; organisms and state-of-the-art reagents; biocontainment facilities; and preclinical and clinical translational research services (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/research/resources/dmid).</p>
<p>The development and introduction of new vaccines and biologics against potential agents of bioterrorism, drug-resistant pathogens, emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, as well as infectious diseases prevalent in resource-limited countries remain a high public health priority. To assist in filling these public health gaps, the NIAID requires a coordinated evaluation and testing services program to provide preclinical, nonclinical, and clinical testing support for multiple vaccine and biologic candidates that emerge from academia, the private sector, or other sources. The suite of testing services will encompass those activities commonly associated with the testing of vaccine and biologic products for infectious disease required for Investigational New Drug (IND) application and/or Biologic License Application (BLA). Consequently, DMID recognizes that to obtain the full spectrum of expertise or facilities required to perform all activities set forth in this solicitation, individual organizations will likely need the expertise and resources of other organizations or persons through consortia agreements, partnerships, subcontracts, and/or consultants. The Contractor shall be responsible for ALL work performed and shall be responsible for project planning, initiation, implementation, management and communication; evaluation, selection, and management of subcontractors; and for all deliverables specified in this contract and each awarded Task Order.</p>
<p>DMID anticipates awarding a single Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract that provides a guaranteed minimum award to the organization or consortium that best meets the overall qualifications needed to fulfill the technical requirements of this solicitation. Sample Task Orders are provided in the RFP solely to evaluate offeror responses and capabilities. Task Orders for specific tasks will be issued after award of the Basic Contract.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives</p>
<p>The purpose of this solicitation is to establish a NIAID resource entitled "Evaluation and Testing Services (ETS) for Vaccines and Other Biologics for Infectious Diseases" that provides a suite of preclinical, nonclinical, and clinical testing services for vaccines and other biologic products. While the overall suite of testing services is comprehensive, the intent is to provide individual services on a case-by-case basis for a diverse collection of vaccine and biological product candidates, rather than carry a single product candidate through an entire preclinical development pathway. These services are intended to help a wide variety of investigators in a broad number of scientific areas obtain critical data needed to acquire additional funding, gain prospective partnerships (either for further development or to support Phase I/II/III trials), fulfill regulatory requirements, and complete studies needed to apply for an IND and enter Phase I/II/III trials.</p>
<p><br />Project Requirements</p>
<p>Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all the necessary services, qualified personnel, materials, equipment, and facilities, not otherwise provided by the Government as needed to perform the tasks below. The Contractor shall be prepared to develop a response to individual Task Orders as they are assigned and to specify the methods it will employ in accomplishing the key components of each Task Order.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide DMID with a broad and flexible range of proactive and developmentally-oriented capabilities to provide testing services to support preclinical, nonclinical, and clinical studies for promising products when such products emerge from investigator-initiated research studies or other sources identified by DMID Program staff. These testing capabilities support early feasibility through Phase III clinical studies to 1) provide the ability to combine, develop, test, evaluate and refine different evaluation and testing technologies from multiple developers; 2) create capacity for the evaluation and testing of candidate vaccines and other biologics for infectious diseases and/or related toxins; 3) increase the Federal Government's response to emerging disease threats; and 4) improve surge capabilities. The Contractor shall also provide appropriate documentation and support for pre-IND, IND, and BLA submissions. <br />Specific Task Orders will depend on the status of the candidate(s) as part of an overall product development plan and/or regulatory submission plan to the FDA. DMID will issue a Task Order Request for Proposal after determination of a specific need that is appropriate to the Statement of Work. The Contractor shall be prepared to develop a response in which the Contractor specifies the methods it will employ in accomplishing the key components of each Task Order and the associated costs. The needs, funding, product maturity and timelines of the product as specified in the Task Order establishes requirements for compliance with current Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) and current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) [21 CFR Parts -11, -58, -210, -211, -600].</p>

<CONTACT>BRADLEY KARBELING
<DESC>Description:
The Social Security Administration (SSA) is attempting to identify responsible contractors that are capable of providing software and accompanying maintenance for the products described below.  The software products will be installed on SSA?s Mainframe Systems at the National Computer Center (NCC) located in Baltimore, Maryland and at the Second Support Center (SSC) located in Durham, North Carolina. The distributed software products will be installed on a number of servers and workstations located in the NCC, the SSC and throughout SSA?s Program Service Centers and the States? Disability Determination Service (DDS) offices.  During the term of the contract period, the software may be moved to another SSA or SSA-controlled site at no additional charge.  
z/OS Software Products:
Product 1 - is an automated fault management tool that is used to quickly diagnose and resolve application and system failures.  It automatically collects and analyzes program and environmental failure information and presents SSA?s technical staff with easy-to-understand diagnostics for faster recovery throughout the application life cycle.  It is also used to bridge the gap between development and legacy system support requirements.  It provides source code support with distributed viewing as well as database support. SSA has a Universal License for this product.  
Product 2 - is used for file and data management.  It is used to improve the speed and quality of testing by allowing the technical staff to create test data without writing or debugging one-time programs, to copy subsets of files based on selection criteria including like to unlike files, to create and customize test data by modifying data as it is viewed on the screen and, to compare two datasets of any file organization using record selection criteria.  Used with Product-1 it quickly identifies data related problems and fixes data errors using simple Interactive System Productivity Facility (ISPF)-like commands.  It protects data against unintended changes and provides and audit trail with reporting capabilities to log changes.  
Product 3 ? provides a number of automated testing solutions designed to validate applications running in the full spectrum of environments.  It isolates and corrects problems, and ensures that the system can handle anticipated workloads before an application is put into production.  It provides comprehensive automated testing for z/Operating System (z/OS) and OS/390 interfaces.  It is also used to analyze and test Message Query (MQ) Series applications.  
Product 4 ? an interactive analysis and debugging tool, used for interactive debugging sessions with minimal setup.  It allows the technical staff to view COBOL, Assembler, C language and PL/I source code as it executes.  This allows the technical staff to suspend program execution at any point, display and change program variables, alter program logic, trap and recover from program errors, set statement execution counts and resume execution from any point in the program.  
Product 5 ? a diagnostic tool that is used to execute runtime analysis, identify individual instructions executed within a test, and to measure the relative risk points in a program.  
Product 6  ? a debugging tool.  It intercepts IBM OS/390 or z/OS DB2 stored procedures.  It allows the technical staff to trap and step through DB2 Stored Procedures, and test actual Work Load Manager address space, eliminating the time consuming work of setting up a simulated environment.  It allows the technical staff to speed up error resolution and test mission critical code.  
Product 7 ? provides SSA?s technical staff with in-depth abend diagnostics for Customer Information Control System (CICS) applications, transactions and regions.  It allows the technical staff to quickly pinpoint the cause of a region or application errors and identify solutions.  
Product 9 ? is used to manage application performance in complex environments.   It measures OS/390 and z/OS on line batch processing activity.  It captures critical application performance data that is used to create a Performance Profile.  The technical staff will use the Performance Profile to locate and eliminate sources of excessive resource demand.  
Product 10  ? helps the technical staff deliver efficient and responsive z/OS applications through the application life cycle.  It will provide optimal application performance management.  It will assist the technical staff in identifying Websphere activity by request including response times and invocation counts for Enterprise JavaBean (EJB), Servlets and JavaServer Pages (JSP) as well as critical Websphere environmental settings.  Product will capture critical application performance data and pinpoint the Java packages, classes, and methods that are most consumptive of central processing unit (CPU) resources.  
Product 11 ? allows the technical staff to measure and analyze the performance of Structured Query Language (SQL) to DB2 files when they present as Disk Drive Format (DDF) files.  It allows the technical staff to quickly identify SQL statements that use significant CPU processing capacity or SQL statements that have poor response times.  It will also reduce CPU consumption of DB2 DDF files and improve SQL response time.  
Product 12 ? is a data management and testing tool.  It will enable SSA?s technical staff to create, populate, customize, refresh, and where appropriate, authorize DB2 objects.  It provides a graphical display of table relationships that make it easy for the technical staff to visualize their location within a database.  It performs full screen browse and edit of DB2 tables.  The product will allow the technical staff to simultaneously brows and edit multiple tables that are unrelated, related through DB2 referential integrity, or related through user defined application relationship.  It can be accessed without writing SQL.  
Product 13 - extracts data from multiple related and unrelated objects, to support data related between DB2 databases and sequential and Virtual Storage Access Method (VSAM) files.  Product will function as a migration tool to extract data, load it to a new database, subsystem, or location and then delete the DB2 source data.  
Product 14 - tests applications that use a 3270 user interface, or Secure Network Access (SNA) LU0/LU2 communication protocols via unattended and interactive tools.            

Distributed Software Products
Product 15 - tests the effects that the network will have on the performance of a new or modified application prior to actually putting it into a production environment.  Product provides the technical staff with the ability to identify applications that will perform poorly.  It provides them with code level proof of problems that the application will encounter in a production environment.  
Product 16 ? monitors network traffic to detect and troubleshoot application performance problems.  It tracks an application?s flow through the local area network/wide area network (LAN/WAN) infrastructure, and collects detailed performance metrics about network traffic, applications, and client and server response times.  The technical staff uses product as a diagnostic tool.  It allows them to profile poorly performing applications, and to drill down into performance characteristics of the impacted network, server and workstation.  
Product 17 - will retrieve Document Management Architecture (DMA) standard sized documents at a set interval and record the end user response time. These response times will be reported to a centralized console/dashboard on a near real time basis. These response time reports will give an ?apples to apples? comparison of the response time at every DDS office.  These response times will be compared to baselines and thresholds, and problem report alerting can be triggered automatically when thresholds are exceeded.
Product 18 ? is a unique feature of Product 15.  It automatically triggers a network trace.
Product 19 ? will be distributed to all workstations at all DDSs.  It will be inactive until needed.  When a slow response time report is received, the agents in that office will be activated to collect response time data for the scripted transactions.  When this feature activates, it will sample a number of production workstations to monitor and report response times for real end users in near real time to the central dashboard. 
Product 20  ? will be used to record the end user?s graphic uers interface (GUI) Windows events for a business transaction and capture the time from the starting mouse clip/enter key until the cursor hourglass is ended.  Staff will create scripts for the DDS offices.   
Product 21 - records a DMA transaction exceeding the response time service level threshold.  It allows the technical staff to trace the file through the software?s drill down capability and then determine the root cause of the slow response. The response time reports will give Systems an ?apples to apples? comparison of the response time at every DDS.

<DESC>USDA is seeking information concerning contractors that demonstrate compatibility with USPS Intelligent Mail barcode (IMb) requirements and corporate ability to provide high volume print and mail services. The Contractor shall utilize government provided Elixir templates and DJDE data streams as input to their mail process. The contractor shall perform address hygiene/standardization and pre-mailing Move Update procedures with resulting information used to correctly build the IM compliant barcode which will be applied to each communication. The Contractor must establish a secure site for NFC to proof outgoing communications and have a clearly established procedure for validation of documents. The Contractor shall process/finish mail by sorting, folding communications, inserting into envelopes, applying postage and arranging pickup or delivery of mail to USPS. The contractor must ensure processed mail enters the mail stream within the time sensitive window provided in section 8.1 Mail Deliverables. The contractor shall facilitate occasional oversight by representatives of the government.<br /><br />The mission of National Finance Center (NFC) is to provide reliable, cost-effective, employee-centric, systems and services to Federal organizations, thus allowing its customers to focus on serving this great Nation through their mission delivery. NFC provides administrative and financial support, including Human Resources (HR) and payroll/personnel processing systems and services, to over 170 Federal and quasi-Federal departments, agencies, boards, and commissions from all three branches of Government. In the process of providing those services, NFC generates multiple types of payroll and HR related documents that are printed and mailed to over 600,000 federal customers. The volume of mail processed fluctuates based on the production schedule at certain times of the year. Many of the high-volume products are processed on an annual basis with the remaining portion processed on a daily, bi-weekly or monthly basis. Most of these mailings are time-sensitive and contain multiple pages which often requires special handling e.g., inserts, folding, envelope stuffing, and/or perforations.<br /><br />In FY 2010, NFC processed approximately 4 million pieces of mail however a recent shift to electronic delivery has provided a significant reduction in the volume of outgoing mail and leads NFC to reevaluate its mail operations. Further influencing NFC's desire to outsource is USPS regulatory changes requiring Intelligent Mail (IM) compliance for bulk mail discounts. By outsourcing mail, NFC anticipates savings in mail related expenditures, more efficient mail services and a reduction in the amount of undeliverable mail. <br />Historically, NFC's mail volumes are based on the numbers of federal customers serviced through its HR and Payroll systems. The actual number of customers varies throughout the year, as new business is introduced and some services are terminated. Taking into account the paperless delivery trend and NFC's scheduled business for FY11 and FY12, NFC estimates approximately 2.5 million and 2 million pieces for FY11/FY12 respectively. <br /><br />NFC system applications are the source for generation of customer communications. The communications, stored in a temporary file, are processed through in-house COBOL programs which format the data creating Xerox DJDE output. At output, DJDE print streams are sent to XPAF (allows printing from IBM mainframe to Xerox printer) for merging with NFC forms created using Elixir Design Pro Tools. Printing is accomplished on duplex capable Xerox printers with 30,000 pages per hour capacity. The black and white prints are produced on standard white 81/2 x 11, 20 lb blank forms. A small subset of customer communications is printed on 24 lb perforated paper. The mail inserting process is set to accommodate first class letter sized mail and can also accomplish folds for booklets. The majority of mail is inserted into a #10 envelope, sorted and labeled by tray and sent with a permit indicia. <br />

<DESC>Concerning Proposed Change to SFLC cutter repair availability specifications
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) in accordance with FAR Part 10, Market Research. This part prescribes policies and procedures for conducting market research to arrive at the most suitable approach to acquiring, distributing, and supporting supplies and services. This RFI is issued solely for market research, planning, and information purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contractual agreement, nor will the Government pay for any effort expended in responding to this notice.</p>
<p>Information received in response to this RFI will be safeguarded from unauthorized disclosure in accordance with FAR 15.207(b); nevertheless, submitters must properly mark their response if it contains information the submitter does not want disclosed to the public for any purpose. If sources elect to submit competition-sensitive or proprietary information, sources bear sole responsibility for marking said information as such to ensure appropriate safeguarding by the Government. The Government shall not be held liable for any damages incurred if proprietary information is not properly identified. All submissions become Government property and will not be returned.<br />Interested parties are encouraged to submit the requested information to Kathryn Stark at Kathryn.e.stark@uscg.mil by COB EST 5 July 2011. If additional information is required to formulate your response to this RFI, request the information through the POC listed above.</p>
<p>Background: Modernization, technical advances, and increased USCG cutter connectivity demands have dramatically impacted our ability to successfully support our assets during dry dock periods. Emergency dry dock periods and shipyard availabilities distant from a cutter homeport weaken already challenging process requirements and security demands. Prior to modernization, providing CGDN+ connectivity to assets in commercial shipyards varied based on a number of factors, including the geographic location of the shipyard, availability of internet connectivity, the local understanding of security requirements, and the availability and source of funding. While multiple technical solutions to provide CGOne connectivity remain available, the Coast Guard seeks to establish a minimum requirement for all assets during dry dock periods.</p>
<p>This RFI seeks industry comments to assist the Government in (1) Improving the Government's understanding of industry capabilities (2) Identifying sources capable of providing these critical services in support of USCG SFLC ship repair availabilities</p>
<p>Capabilities Sought:</p>
<p>Contractor activities shall be conducted at contractor facilities. No government-furnished equipment will be provided to the contractor for use in the contractor's facility.</p>
<p>3.3.2 Broadband. Provide Standard Broadband internet connectivity, distinct from any existing broadband internet connectivity the shipyard may already utilize. Broadband connectivity shall have a download speed of at least 4 Mbps and an interface modem or router that provides a DHCP interface and a 100BaseT Ethernet connection to customer's equipment. Coast Guard technicians must be afforded access during normal business hours to the interface modem or router to establish/troubleshoot/disestablish connectivity for the vessel.</p>
<p><br />Requested Information</p>
<p>Interested parties of any size can submit a capability statement that details their corporate capabilities and experience in performing similar tasks as outlined above. Within this capability statement, vendors must detail relevant, recent experience. In addition to the above, interested parties are required to provide, at a minimum, the following information within the capability statement:</p>
<p>Company Name<br />DUNS Number<br />NAIC Codes<br />Business Size Per Code<br />Address<br />Point of Contact (Name, Email, Phone Number)</p>
<p>1) Do you currently provide Standard Broadband internet connectivity to your customers during shiprepair availabilities, distinct from any existing broadband internet connectivity your shipyard may already use?</p>
<p>2) Does the broadband connectivity your company provides have a download speed of at least 4 Mbps, an interface modem or router that provides a DHCP interface and a 100BaseT Ethernet connection that can be connected to a customer's equipment?</p>
<p>3) If your company does not currently provide Standard Broadband internet connectivity to your customers during shiprepair availabilities, distinct from any existing broadband internet connectivity your shipyard may already use, provide an explanation of whether your company has the capability and capacity to conform to this standard.</p>
<p>4) If your company does not currently have broadband connectivity with a download speed of at least 4 Mbps, an interface modem or router that provides a DHCP interface and a 100BaseT Ethernet connection that can be connected to a customer's equipment, provide an explanation of whether your company has the capability to conform to this standard.</p>
<p>5) What limitations do you have if any?</p>
<p>6) If there are additional costs associated with providing these services that your company does not normally incur, please provide an estimated price to implement these services and if there is one, a monthly price to maintain the service. Provide one total for the implementation phase and one total for the monthly service phase. Please label accordingly.</p>
<p><br />Interested companies shall provide responses of no more than 3 pages to Kathryn.e.stark@uscg.mil .</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this RFI is to conduct market research which will be used to formulate an acquisition strategy to support a full and complete museum quality restoration of an M-198 Damn Yankee Howitzer for static display in the National Museum of the Marine Corps (NMMC).  This RFI allows potential contractors to submit a non-binding statement of interest and documentation demonstrating their corporate capabilities and suggestions that will allow the Government to refine its potential course of action.  The RFI effort is intended to assess industry service capabilities and solicit feedback for acquisition planning purposes.  The Regional Contracting Office, National Capital Region (RCO-NCR) is requesting responses from qualified businesses concerns.
  The qualifying NAICS code for this effort is 332995.  

The NMMC is responsible for collecting, safeguarding, displaying and preservation of an expanding aircraft, heavy ordnance weapons and vehicle collection in support of exhibits throughout the NMMC, regional Department of Defense (DoD) and National Level agencies and local municipalities.  These artifacts also provide a medium for the professional development of individual Marines.  The artifact shall be displayed inside Galleries of the NMMC as a part of the Phase II build out scheduled for sometime in 2012.  

The M-198 Damn Yankee Howitzer	weighs 15,772 lbs and has the following specifications:   total length: 36 feet 2 inches, width is given as 9 feet 2 inches and the height is 9 feet  6 inches.
  This artifact is to be restored to depict the artifacts appearance as it was used in combat.  

The National Museum for the Marine Corps (NMMC) requirement will require contractor support with the capability to:  

1)	Completely dismantle, restore and deliver the artifact and all of its components (museum quality) within 12 months of contract award.  

2)	Drain and remove, from the Frame/Gun, all oil and grease from the components (including but not limited to: axles, wheels, sprockets, interior and exterior, gear box and drive components); The methods used for the removal of all corrosion, paint, oil and grease must be included in a Plan of Action (POA). 
 
3)	Preserve the units individual components without the use of grease or oil (the hydraulic components of this artifact must remain functional and therefore shall not be preserved).
  

3)	Furnish, by purchase or fabrication if necessary, all missing, incomplete or incorrect components and provide a complete digital photographic record and written report upon delivery of the artifact to the NMMC.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION: This is not a solicitation.  As part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) market research process, this is a request for information (RFI) to assist VA in developing an acquisition strategy, a performance work statement and performance specifications for a potential future requirement associated with the Cerner Corporation (Cerner) Millennium PathNet commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) associated with the Laboratory Systems Reengineering Project (LSRP) that is currently undergoing Alpha and Beta testing within VA to demonstrate the required functionality to support future National Deployment of this COTS application.  More specifically, VA is seeking industry input related to Remote Hosting to support National Deployment of the Cerner Millennium PathNet LIMS application currently undergoing Alpha/Beta testing.  
BACKGROUND: In FY08, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Laboratory Systems Re-engineering Project (LSRP) selected Cerner's Millennium PathNet solution as the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Laboratory Information Management system (LIMS).  The enterprise implementation of LIMS is in progress and the LSRP is evaluating go-forward technology options that will meet or exceed the strategic goals established in the project's cost benefit analysis (CBA) justification and long-term sustainment requirements.
The VA is currently confronted with the decision to acquire and build the primary domain and disaster recovery infrastructure, as well as the decision to invest in personnel and training for the system technical staff and application support staff required to maintain the Cerner PathNet Millennium environment.  This decision is not just limited to the initial capital cost of equipment and future hardware technology upgrades and refreshes, but also must address data center operations management, cost, security, space, HVAC and power.
Currently VA is planning to acquire the Cerner Millennium PathNet licenses necessary for the national deployment and has begun implementation at Alpha and Beta sites. The scope of this RFI for National Deployment includes 1) Remote Hosting of Cerner Millennium PathNet application 2) Systems Management Services in support of Cerner Millennium PathNet application and 3) Application Management Services for Cerner application Please see attachment VA LSRP RHO ND RFI Attachment 1 Scope Draft v1.docx for details.
INFORMATION REQUESTED FROM INDUSTRY:  Request interested parties provide information for the following areas: 
1)	Describe your capabilities to remote host and experience providing System Application Management for the proprietary Cerner Millennium PathNet application for a large scale multi facility operation. 
2)	Provide a narrative overview of the remote hosting that might make up the overall solution.  Include information outlining how the proposed solution could meet the requirements in Section 3.1 of the attachment.  Please describe a how the remote hosting solution of the proprietary Cerner Millennium PathNet application will support a phased national deployment of LSRP including the flexibility to alter deployment strategy based on lessons learned during each phase at the same time providing a best value solution to VA. Please describe any best incremental remote hosting capacity build up practices.
3)	Provide a narrative overview of the transition support identified in Section 3.2 of the attachment.  The transition would include transitioning from the current environment to the future remote hosting environment as well.
4)	Describe the largest similar effort you have completed to-date hosting Cerner or similar  application including any Federal or Public Sector effort.
5)	Provide a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) estimate assuming the implementation of the remote hosting and ensure the estimate takes into account a five (5) year rollout. Please break up the ROM into three broad areas of scope of work as described above in the background section.
6)	If you are a small business under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541519, Information Technology Value Added Resellers, and anticipate proposing as a prime contractor, would you require a waiver to the non-manufacturer rule to be eligible for a set-aside?  For more information regarding the non-manufacturer rule, see http://www.sba.gov/content/non-manufacturer-waivers.
7)	Provide the full breadth of commodities and support services required in the attached scope of work with or without teaming arrangements.
8)	Based on your response to question #6, describe projected order processing/delivery capacity (e.g. delivery turnaround time, monthly product quantities, etc.) to support a large agency like the VA.
9)	Provide a list of the government or non-government customers to whom you are providing comparable services. Describe briefly the type services and any contact information.
10)	The solution must support both IPv4 and the IPv6 protocol.  The solution will initially be implemented over an IPv4 only network.   At the option of the government the solution must begin transitioning to dual-stack IPv4 and IPv6 over a period of not more than 60 days. Following dual-stack implementation and at the option of the government the solution must begin transition to native and exclusive IPv6 operation over a period of not more than 30 days.

<DESC>Introduction:  Pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1), the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the Natick Soldier System Center (NSSC), intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order on a sole source basis to: Covance Laboratories, Inc ,  3301 Kinsman Blvd, Madison WI  53704.   <br><br>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  No solicitation document is available. <br><br>1) FAR Statutory Authority cited: 13.106-1b(1) only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.<br><br>2) Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs:  The Military Nutrition Division is conducting research to catalog the nutritional composition of the current ration components available for purchase and consumption by our Warfighters both in theater and during training scenarios'. A better understanding of ration nutritional composition will aid in the research conducted by the Military Nutrition Division whose research is aimed to optimize Warfighter health and performance through nutrition.  Nutritional composition analyses require up-to-date equipment, knowledgeable staff, consistency of analysis techniques as well as stringent quality control methods.  The Military Nutrition Division does not possess the facilities or personnel to conduct these analyses.  The intent is to award a Firm Fixed Price type contract for $70,902.00. This contract will procure the services of Covance Laboratories Inc. to perform analysis of food samples from Meal-Ready-to-Eat (MRE) version 31 and Meal Cold Weather (MCW) in two phases (pre and post storage).  This contract will include tasks which will be completed by 1 April 2012 (Phase I) and 1 November 2012 (Phase II).<br><br>3) A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.): This vendor is the only vendor capable of meeting the requirements of the Military Nutrition Division's research needs required in the ongoing Ration Analysis Program.  The end product of the Ration Analysis Program is a cumulative database with requirements to include single item comparisons of nutritional content.  Analyses have been conducted by this vender since the inception of this program (> 5 years) due to the complexity of the nutrient analysis comparison over both time (newly procured items versus stored item nutrient changes) and over ration procurement years (changes in recipe formulations).   This vendor has the quality control measures needed to stabilize and compare the results required for the Ration Analysis Program Database.  This is a necessity when maintaining a database containing complex data trending storage and procurement changes over time.   Changing vendors would be harmful in data analysis, research results, and publication validity.<br>  <br>4) A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:  Market research was conducted at Ration Analysis Program inception concluding that Covance Laboratories Inc. provided all the necessary food analysis requirements and maintained the quality control measures required to meet the needs of the Program.  Due to the need for continuity over time, Covance is the only source available for the continuation of this Program.  Covance has over 30 years experience in the food analysis tests for USDA, FDA and AOAC.  Covance provides excellent services for the good of the government.	 <br>5) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition: Our previous market survey indicated that only Covance Laboratories Inc. had the skilled professional staff and resources necessary to perform the tasks required to conduct these tests.  USARIEM identified Covance Laboratories Inc. as the most viable option, based on past performance, technical capability and cost.  To date, no other sources have written to express an interest.<br>6) A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required:  Not feasible at our level.<br><br><br>Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement to the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division via e-mail to: greg.n.wilson@us.army.mil no later than 8:00 a.m. on June 20, 2011. <br><br>Contracting Office Address: <br>RDECOM Contracting Center - Natick<br>CCRD-NA-SU, Natick Contracting Division<br>Kansas Street, Building 1<br>Natick, MA 01760-5011<br><br>Point of Contact:<br>Greg Wilson, Contract Specialist<br>Greg.N.Wilson@us.army.mil<br>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Human Resources Command (HRC), The Adjutant General Directorate (TAGD), Casualty and Mortuary Affairs Operation Center (CMAOC), has a requirement for non-personal services to provide all labor, tools, personnel, and management necessary for the development, maintenance, updating, and/or revision of CMAOC multimedia training products.  The multimedia training products will assist in providing the specialized knowledge and training required for various CMAOC functions. Supplies and services will include the following:<br><br>a.	Developing new multimedia training products<br>b.	Providing ongoing maintenance, editing, and enrichment of online training modules<br>c.	Creating, developing, and producing new video scenarios and interviews<br>d.	Improving functionality of online training products<br>e.	Responding to legislative changes impacting training products<br>f.	Retrofitting existing online training products to comply with Section 508 requirements as required by law<br>g.	Creating and/or updating and mass producing multimedia guides<br><br><br>HRC intends to award this requirement noncompetitively IAW FAR 6.302-1 to Science Application International Corportation (SAIC) as a one-year sole source bridge contract. The aforementioned services must be performed by SAIC  because SAIC is the only contractor prepared and readily available to provide uninterrupted multimedia services in the one year time frame needed to plan and execute a new competitive solicitation.  Per MICC Center - Fort Knox, it will take one year for them to properly solicit and award a new long-term contract for multimedia requirements. The multimedia requirements require a unique skill-set and specialized experience because the material is extremely sensitive in nature due to CMAOC's mission which includes Casualty Notification, Casualty Assistance, Escorts, and Chaplain Duties. SAIC understands the issues and sensitive nature of the Casualty Assistance program and its processes and is the only contractor who can perform without a significant learning curve and training time required, which can be expected to take several months.  <br><br>Other interested firms having the ability to furnish these services shall submit a capabilities statement to the Contract Specialist demonstrating the capability to provide the required services no later than the closing date of this announcement. This notice of intent is not a Request for Competitive Proposals and serves as informational purposes only. A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. <br><br>All questions and requests regarding this procurement shall be in writing and addressed to Nayyirah Zaman at nayyirah.zaman@us.army.mil. <br><br><br><br><br><br>

<DESC><p>Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) intends to issue a sole source contract award under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), only one responsible source, to Dimensional Insights, the incumbent contractor providing Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) support services. The period of performance will be a base year with three 1-year options. DTRA's requirement for EEO Support Services includes: experience in EEO/EO issues to include EEO counseling, investigations, mediation and processing complaints from counseling to final agency decision; knowledge of all aspects of the civilian EEO program to include compliance reviews, AEP, Special Emphasis Programs (Federal Women's, Hispanic Employment, Individuals with Disabilities, etc.), reporting requirements, outreach, training, mediation, diversity, prevention of sexual harassment and reasonable accommodation; knowledge and experience with the myriad of reports required (e.g. MD-715, DVAAP, NoFEAR, FEORP). Dimensional Insights is the only source that can provide uninterrupted service with no degradation in support as it holds critical knowledge and experience regarding current EEO/EO cases and complaints. Dimensional Insights is in the process of completing several mandated reports that must be reported to the EEOC and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Attempting to change contractors at this critical point in the report data collection and compilation process would result in missed report deadlines. This sole source contract award provides DTRA a senior-level EO subject matter expert required to meet statutory timelines for cases, claims, and reports. Market research was conducted through a Sources Sought Notice and several 8(a) capability briefings. Analysis of Sources Sought responses and 8(a) capability briefings did not reveal any company other than the incumbent that could provide a senior level subject matter expert capable of meeting the entire requirement. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals or a solicitation of offers. However, if a company has reason to believe that it can meet or exceed DTRA requirements for these support services, it must submit documentation to support its claim. The decision not to compete this requirement is within the discretion of the Government. All questions regarding this notice should be forwarded in writing to Ernest Caldwell Jr at ernest.caldwell@dtra.mil. Responses to this notice must be received by close of business, June 28, 2011. Responses must also include your business name, point of contact, address, and telephone number with area code.</p>

It will also serve as a update to existing image base data for Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park (KLGO).

This conference will be held via teleconference on June 22, 2011 at 09:00 CST.   <br><br>The Corpus Christi Ship Channel, La Quinta Channel Extension, Pipeline Dredging 2011 contract will consist of dredging to remove approximately 6,000,000 cubic yards associated with new channel extension and subsequent construction of new open bay beneficial use (BU) site.  This job involves dredging previously undisturbed bay bottom to a depth of -41 ft. to extend the La Quinta Channel by a distance of 1.4 miles.  Subsequent placement of the dredged clays will be required in adjacent open bay to create a 2-mile long solid clay levee which will be rock armored to +9 ft. MLT.  This 2-mile levee will form the eastern, southern, and western edges of a new 190-acre BU site. Dredged clayey materials will also be placed along the northern levee alignment up to +1 ft. MLT enclosing the new BU site.  Additional material to be dredged will then be placed in the BU site to provide a bed for future sea grass development following completion of the levee system.  Remaining dredged material not used in the construction and filling of the BU site will be placed in adjacent upland placement areas 13 and 14.<br><br>A "DRAFT" copy of the technical specification, plans, and available geotechnical studies are attached. <br><br>Topics for the conference include but are not limited to: scope of work, site conditions, sequence and placement methods for the BU site, construction methods for the levee, project schedule, and questions and comments.

<p>US Personal Services Contract<br />US Department of State<br />Bureau for International Narcotics &amp; Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) <br />American Embassy Tbilisi, Georgia</p>
<p>Background: <br />The State Department Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) program in the Republic of Georgia is funded from the Assistance to Europe, Europe, and Central Asia (AEECA) account. AEECA is a comprehensive, multi-year regional initiative designed to provide U.S. foreign assistance to support democratic and economic transition in the former Soviet Union, by promoting economic and democratic reform, encouraging good governance, improving capabilities of law enforcement and criminal justice sector institutions to combat organized crime and narcotics trafficking, and by strengthening border security to secure against threats to regional stability.</p>
<p>INL programs supported through AEECA assistance focus on reforming law enforcement institutions and the criminal justice system, as well as building the capacity of justice sector institutions and actors in Eurasia. Currently, the AEECA assistance program administered domestically by INL in support of law enforcement reform and criminal justice capacity building efforts in Georgia totals over $34 million. A smaller quantity of International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement (INCLE) funds are also administered overseas at Post.</p>
<p>INCLE-funded assistance to the Government of Georgia's (GOG) probation and parole system was discussed bilaterally in 2009 and assistance is expected to begin in 2011. This activity is part of a much larger effort aimed at achieving a core U.S. national security objective. One means to this end is the promotion of greater security and rule of law in areas under the GOG's control, support that buttresses the foundations of a democratic state. The establishment of a stable, well-trained, and equipped probation and parole system is a GOG priority as it reforms its criminal justice system.</p>
<p>Criminal justice assistance is a core component of the USG contribution to stability and reconstruction operations worldwide. At present, INL manages criminal justice policy and programs in many international locations and over 1,000 personnel are deployed overseas in the field to implement these programs.</p>
<p>Within the U.S. Embassy Tbilisi, the Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs Section (NAS) functions as the INL field office to manage bilateral assistance projects that design, build, and nurture the capabilities of law enforcement agencies in Georgia. NAS Tbilisi coordinates and provides a broad range of training, services, and equipment aimed at improving the organizational efficiency, capabilities, and infrastructure of host government law enforcement and judicial institutions.</p>
<p>Purpose:<br />The purpose of this PSC is to provide a Probation and Parole Advisor (PPA) to NAS Tbilisi, Georgia, to serve as the USG resident civilian probation and parole expert who provides expertise to the GOG on the full range of probation and parole issues as they relate to the GOG criminal justice system.

<p>The PPA provides the technical expertise within the Embassy and (when directed) on behalf of INL and the NAS in interagency settings, for activities aimed at improving INL and broader USG and international assistance on probation and parole systems.

Authorized Workers Notice to Potential Bureau of Reclamation Contractors(a)	Definitions.  		IRCA - Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986		INA - Immigration and Nationality Act		INS - Immigration and Naturalization Service 		SSA - Social Security Administration		INS SAVE Program - The INS Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements Program		ESA - Employment Standards Administration (Department of Labor)
(a) Authority.  Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (8 USC 1101 as amended) and the Immigration and Nationality Act, Section 274A.
 	(b) Who is Covered.  INA includes provisions addressing employment eligibility, employment verification, and nondiscrimination.  These provisions apply to all employers, including government contractors.
 	(c) Basic Provisions/Requirements.   Under IRCA, employers may hire only persons who may legally work in the U.S., i.e., citizens and nationals of the U.S. and aliens authorized to work in the U.S.  The employer must verify the identity and employment eligibility of anyone to be hired, which includes completing the Employment Eligibility Verification Form (I-9).  Employers must keep each I-9 on file for at least three years, or one year after employment ends, whichever is longer.  Detailed guidance on the I-9 is available at the INS web site:http://www.ins.gov/graphics/services/employerinfo/index.htm .
	(d) Employment Verification Pilot Programs.  The INS and the SSA are conducting the following programs that provide employers a way to confirm the employment eligibility of their newly hired employees.  Any employer located in a pilot state may volunteer to participate in a pilot program.  If employers are not located in a pilot state, they would verify employment eligibility by following the procedures currently in place, i.e., by completing Form I-9.
(1) The Basic Pilot is a joint pilot being conducted by the INS and SSA in the States of California, Florida, Illinois, Nebraska, New York, and Texas. This pilot involves verification checks of the SSA and INS databases of all newly hired employees, regardless of citizenship. To receive information on the Basic Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981, or write to USINS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO Building 4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536. You may also contact the Social Security Administration by calling (410) 966-1940, or writing to Social Security Administration, Office of Program Benefits Policy, 6401 Security Blvd., 760 Altmeyer, Baltimore, MD 21235.
(2) The INS is conducting the Citizen Attestation Pilot in the States of Arizona, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, and Virginia.  The Citizen Attestation Pilot permits participating employers to electronically verify the employment eligibility of newly hired alien employees by using a personal computer with a modem.  To receive information on the Citizen Attestation Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981.  Employers may also write to US/INS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO-4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536.
(3) The INS and the SSA are conducting the Machine-Readable Document Pilot in the State of Iowa. The Machine-Readable Document Pilot is identical to the Basic Pilot in all respects, except for the geographic scope of the pilot and for one additional feature.  If an employee presents an Iowa's driver's license or identification card containing a machine-readable SSN, the employer will make an inquiry through the confirmation system by using the machine-readable feature.  To receive information on the Machine-Readable Document Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981. You may also write to US/INS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO-4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536.
 	(e) Employee Rights.  The INA protects U.S. citizens and aliens authorized to accept employment in the U.S. from discrimination in hiring or discharge on the basis of national origin and citizenship status.
 	(f) Compliance Assistance.  More detailed information, including copies of explanatory brochures and regulatory and interpretative materials, may be obtained from local offices of the Department of Labor's Employment Standards Division, Wage and Hour Division, and the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs.
 	(g) Penalties/Sanctions.  Employers who fail to complete and/or retain the I-9 forms are subject to penalties. The INS enforces the INA requirements on verification of employment eligibility. The Justice Department enforces the anti-discrimination provisions.  As part of their ongoing enforcement efforts, the ESA's Wage and Hour Division and Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs conduct inspections of the I-9 forms.  They report their findings to the INS and to the Department of Justice when they find cases of disparate treatment or unauthorized employment.  A debarring official may debar a contractor, based on a determination by the Attorney General of the United States, or designee, that the contractor is not in compliance with the INA. The Attorney General's determination is not reviewable in the debarment proceedings.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Dressing Sponges. The MMESO West is the lead MMESO for this project. <br /></strong>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the MMESO North, South, West, Pacific, Europe (hereafter referred to as MMESOs) areas of responsibility (AOR) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. This Standardization Action (SA) will apply to all MMESOs. It is intended for this initiative to result in the standardization of a technically and clinically preferred product (s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the best possible price. It is intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance requirements as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical the clinical preferred threshold, best price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor (s) for this SA support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. The government is seeking a single award for this SA.
<p>The major facilities in the MMESOs include, but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed Army Medical Center, National Naval Medical Center, Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South: Wilford Hall Medical Center, Brooke Army Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital; MMESO West: Naval Medical Center San Diego, Madigan Army Medical Center, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific: Tripler Army Medical Center, Honolulu, HI, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe: Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, the 48th Medical Group, Lakenheath, UK; and Operational U.S. Forces.<br />This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESOs Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil</p>
<p>This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor (s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to advance and participate Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be run concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is September 2011.</strong> The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. <strong>Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization Cost) will determine selection. <br />Point of Contact: Ricardo Orias, MMESO West Team Leader, Ricardo.orias.ctr@med.navy.mil,(619)532-8537; Cindy Ingrao, MMESO West Clinical Analyst, Cynthia.ingrao.ctr@med.navy.mil,(619) 532-8517;Cheryl Janus, MMESO West Clinical Analyst, Cheryl.janus.ctr@med.navy.mil,(619) 532-7554.</strong></p>
<p>B. Products &amp; Performance Required <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Dressing Sponges. Within the MMESOs, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $2,721,781. This forecast is based on historical Prime Vendor sales during a recent 12-month period. Based on the recent 12-month usage data, the top thirty six (36) line items of the total one hundred nine (109) line items, account for 81.8% ($2,226,508) of the total volume in sales ($2,721,781) in the MMESOs and are procurement significant. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Requirements below, consolidated by product type to reduce duplication within the top 7 lines. This represents the line item, or SKU, reduction that is an additional objective of this program.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>A vendor interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide an initial response to the FBO-posted RFIAQ to Ricardo Orias, MMESO West Team Leader, ricardo.orias.ctr@med.navy.mil, Ms. Cindy Ingrao, Clinical Analyst, cynthia.ingrao.ctr@med.navy.mil and Ms. Cheryl Janus, Clinical Analyst, cheryl.janus.ctr@med.navy.mil.</strong> The vendor's initial responses will include detailed information requested in the technical/company requirements and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); and (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO West that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the MMESO West via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendor should complete and submit the attached document. Vendor who cannot open the attachments, may contact the POC as noted in the FBO RFIAQ before the COB on the date listed for closing and a copy will be provided to vendor via an alternate medium (fax, email or hard copy). <strong>A vendor who does not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Pacific Standard Time (PST) on the date listed for closing, will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative. </strong></p>
<p>D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs. The MMESO West reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.</p>
<p>Phase I Technical / Company Requirements<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company requirements and determine acceptability. Vendor must meet the technical requirements for continued consideration in this initiative. Vendor who does not meet the requirements will be disqualified. Failure to provide any requested information or meet any of the technical requirements will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. A vendor who meets the following technical/company requirements will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance selection and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) should be digitally signed.</p>
<p>Technical/Company Requirements: During the acquisition planning process, the MMESO CPT validated/approved the technical/company requirements outlined below. The four (4) requirements below must be answered with the vendor's initial submittal by the response date stated in the FBO announcement. <strong>A vendor who does not answer these requirements or provide documentation as needed to support these requirements will be disqualified in Phase I.<br /><br /></strong>1. Vendor MUST provide a line of Dressing Sponges products that includes at a minimum the specific products identified below for sterile and non-sterile, woven, and latex free/safe Dressing Sponges in a variety of materials and widths as follows: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; a.<br />GAUZE SPONGE, 8X4 12PLY BULK NONSTERILE<br />GAUZE SPONGE, DRESSING, 4X4IN 8PLY NON-STERILE<br />GAUZE SPONGE, DRESSING, 4X4IN 12PLY STERILE<br />COVER SPONGE, RAYON/CELLULOSE, PEEL-BACK PKG, 4" X 4", STERILE<br />GAUZE SPONGE, DRESSING, 2X2IN 8PLY STERILE<br />SPONGE FLUFF MEDIUM 6X6 3/4IN DIAG <br />3" X 8", FINE MESH, STERILE<br />* Operational usage items are included in this list of Dressing Sponges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp;Vendor MUST provide a complete itemized list of items supplied (manufacture and/or distribute by brands and descriptions) via excel sheet, and product catalog &amp; literature in response to this RFIAQ with initial submittal. A vendor is required to supply all items listed in all sizes and device type. <br />3. Vendor MUST have a DAPA or be in the process of obtaining a DAPA for the Dressing Sponges product line. Vendor MUST provide DAPA number with initial submittal or provide documentation that DAPA has been applied for with response submittal.<br />4. Vendor MUST have agreements with the current Med/Surg Prime Vendors for each MMESO AOR, i.e. Cardinal Health and Owens &amp; Minor for Dressing Sponges or be in the process of obtaining Prime Vendor agreements. Vendor must provide documentation to support agreements with initial submittal. <br />5. Vendor MUST submit discounts off of DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. <br />Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price. Vendor shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.</p>
<p>Phase II Acceptability Evaluation Clinical Performance<br />Clinical Performance Requirements <br />Following acceptability of the technical/company requirements, the MMESO West, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent to the CPT members at the participating MTFs. Vendor will be given <strong>30 calendar days</strong> from the issue of the notice in which to deliver the product samples for clinical evaluation at Phase II. <strong>Product samples must be shipped to arrive at the designated addresses by 5:00PM local time for each MTF on the 30th calendar day after the notice to ship. Vendor MUST be able to deliver product literature, training materials and evaluation samples to the MMESO Pacific via FedEx or UPS AND to the MMESO Europe via United States Postal Service (USPS) and throughout the United States when requested in Phase II. Vendor who cannot or does not meet this requirement will be disqualified from the standardization process. Vendor must send the MMESO West verification regarding the shipment of literature and samples. This information will include the date of shipment, final delivery date, tracking numbers and the carrier used by the vendor.</strong> Vendor will provide ONLY the following no cost product samples for clinical/performance evaluation. (Unused samples will not be returned). Two (2) packs of each type and size listed below are to be provided as samples to each of the evaluation sites as identified in the letters of invitation. <br />Gauze Sponge Dressing, 4X4IN 8PLY Non-Sterile<br />Gauze Sponge Dressing, 2X2IN 8PLY Sterile <br />Gauze Sponge Dressing 4X4IN 12PLY Sterile <br />Cover Sponge, Rayon/Cellulose, Peel-Pack4X4 Sterile <br />Sponge Fluff Medium 6X6 3/4IN Diagnostic<br />3" X 8" Fine Mesh, Sterile</p>
<p>The clinical/performance acceptability evaluation period will last for fourteen (14) calendar days. Each evaluator will evaluate each Dressing Sponge product sample from each vendor against the established requirements. A trial will consist of evaluating all sample products from a single vendor, evaluated against the requirements and recorded on a single evaluation form per vendor. The acceptability evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a one (1) through five (5) scoring range. The scale descriptors are: one (1) - Completely Unacceptable, two (2) - Overwhelmingly Unacceptable, three (3) - Partially Unacceptable, four (4) - Acceptable, and five (5) - Highly Acceptable. The MMESO JPRB has established a <strong>4.0 as the Clinically Preferred threshold of products for standardization. </strong></p>
<p>A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. Of those vendors who are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on best price. A vendor who has been disqualified or has not been selected will be notified in writing upon disqualification. Clinical /performance acceptability evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance acceptability evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO West, and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review.</p>
<p>There will be sixteen (16) MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Requirements: During the acquisition planning process, the MMESO CPT validated/approved the clinical/performance requirements outlined below. <br />1. The dressing sponge does not lint/release fragments of material. (Patient Safety - NPSG #7 - 07.05.01) The weave and composition of the dressing sponge must remain securely intact. The release of woven material fragments can contribute to the formation of granulomas and/or act as a foreign body which may contribute to a Hospital Acquired Surgical Site infection.<br />2. The dressing sponge is composed of a soft and absorbable material. (Patient Safety/Comfort - NPSG 07.05.01) Product should be soft and absorbable reducing risk of tissue damage to patient. Abrasive materials can damage the skin and internal tissues and contribute to bleeding, abrade tissue and cause harm to surrounding tissue which results in an inflammatory response to the tissue damage.<br />3. The dressing sponge is durable and does not fray. (Patient Safety - NPSG-7.05.01) Product will have woven material which will maintain its shape and required construction. Sponges which do not retain durability and fray can be harmful to the tissue.<br />4. The packaging must be constructed allowing for immediate sterile opening during sterile procedure and allows for aseptic delivery to the sterile field. (Patient Safety and Efficiency of Usage) Package edges should separate easily and evenly. Packaging/containers which open unevenly can deliver a contaminated sponge to a sterile field.</p>
<p>Phase III Pricing Analysis<br />Price Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, a vendor who is found technically acceptable will be qualified /invited to provide product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. A vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit IA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. <strong>Pricing will be submitted to MMESO West by 5:00 PM PST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes.</strong> Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs). Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendor's offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post-Standardization Cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). <strong>Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected.</strong></p>

SECTION C - Description/Specifications/SOW

1.1	Purpose

Proper destruction and recycling of designated paper material that may contain personal identifiable information (PII.)  All shredding must be performed on-site subject to Federal Investigative Services (FIS) oversight.  

1.2	Background 

The Office of Personnel Management, Federal Investigative Services (OPM/FIS) is located in Boyers, PA and performs pre-employment background investigations.  The records of these investigations are currently housed in government-leased space in a former limestone mine owned by Iron Mountain. These investigations generate a significant amount of paper records.  OPM is currently governed under National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) retention schedule(s) and must abide by the guidelines governing records disposal.  In addition, OPM/FIS maintains two offices in the Slippery Rock, PA area that will be covered under this agreement. 

1.3	Scope

The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment (to include lockable collection bins,) tools, materials, supervision, disposal transportation, and other items and services necessary to shred paper products to render them unusable, unreadable, and shall remove shredded material from OPM Federal Investigative Services, WPA Operations (Boyers, PA and two offices located in Slippery Rock, PA).  Additionally, the contractor will supply sufficient personnel and/or vehicles to transport the materials to be shredded from the designated staging area to the shredder(s).  The contractor will clean/remove all residue and residual shredding material from the on-site shredding process.  The resulting shredded byproduct must be recycled utilizing an industry acceptable method and documented in the contractors Quality Control Plan.  

The Contractor is required to provide qualified personnel with the required investigation at its expense.  For personnel requiring investigation, the Contractor will reimburse OPM for the investigation in accordance with the published rates set forth each fiscal year in the Federal Investigation Notice.  For personnel holding an existing investigation, the Contractor will pay a $200 adjudication fee.  If additional work is required, the Contractor will pay the published RSI Federal Investigation Notice (FIN) price.

All personnel working on this contract will be subject to an appropriate background investigation; a BI-level investigation at the current FIN price.

All facilities/vehicles used for this contract must meet minimum security standards outlined in the FIS Security Manual and be subject to periodic announced and unannounced inspections by the FIS Security & Safety Team (SST.)

1.3	Identification Requirements 

All contract employees, including supervisors, must wear distinctive clothing for ready identification.  The Government will restrict access of any contractor employees who are improperly attired.

2.	GENERAL INFORMATION

2.1	Government Furnished Property (GFP)

No government property shall be furnished. 

2.2	Shredding Location 

The contractor shall shred all material collected at the Boyers, PA location at the Iron Mountain complex (space will be provided in the parking lot as directed by the COTR).  The contractor shall shred all material collected at the OPM National Training Center located in Slippery Rock, PA within the parking lot of that specific facility.  The contractor shall shred all material collected at the OPM Pittsburgh Field Office located in Slippery Rock, PA within the parking lot of that specific facility.  Material collected at one facility may not be transported to another facility without being shredded.  

As an example:  material collected at the National Training Center may not be moved to the Boyers facility to be shredded.  This material must be shredded at the National Training Center. 

At all locations the contractor will be responsible for transporting bins from the OPM facility to an outside location for shredding (ie. Parking lot). The contractor must provide a written plan regarding the method of transportation.  This plan may be combined with schedule referenced below, but must be specific to each location. 

If a situation should arise that would require a relocation of the shredding area, the FIS Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTR) has the authority to approve a temporary shred re-location.  This temporary location change will be requested in a written format to the COTR for approval.  The contractor will also be required to draft a contingency plan that will highlight an off-site shredding strategy if necessitated. 

The contractor shall set a schedule for picking up full bins, replacing empty bins, and staging excess bins for review and approval.  The proposed schedule must include the Boyers, PA location as well as the offices (2) located in Slippery Rock, PA.  Once schedule approval is accomplished, this will be the schedule the contractor will be evaluated on for contract performance.  The contractor will allow for unscheduled pickups, and supplying authorized cleared personnel to perform the pickups.  At the time of pick-up, the full bins will be immediately replaced with empty bins. The contractor will maintain a minimum of 10% in surplus bins to accomplish this and other unforeseen events.

The contractor shall not use, allow access to, or offer for resale any papers, documents, file record material or any other form of records as files, records, or for the information contained therein.
	
2.4	Reporting Tonnage 

The contractor shall report the total amount of paper shredded by weight in pounds on the monthly invoice.  This weight will be actual weight as determined by a contractor-provided scale certified and recertified on an appropriate schedule as dictated by the State of Pennsylvania.  If estimates of weight are provided, the method used to determine the estimate shall be provided and approved.  This report will also require a breakdown of the total number of bins shredded during the billing period.  Procedures are outlined in paragraphs 3.1 and 3.2.  

2.5	Dissemination of Policies

The contractor is responsible to ensure that their employees who are performing services are fully knowledgeable regarding the requirements of this contract and will be fully trained, competent, and cleared with the appropriate background investigation to perform the required work.

2.6	Shredding Schedule

The contractor shall schedule shredding based on 9,750 pounds of material per day. 

3.	SHREDDING SPECIFICATIONS 

3.1	Containers

The contractor will supply OPM with securable bins to be placed at designated locations by the COTR.  While the COTR is responsible for the location of the bins, the contractor is responsible for placement, collection, and replacement of bins.  The size of the containers should be similar to the standard wheeled 64 gallon size (27.5 wide x 40 long x 34 high).  The actual sizes may vary slightly. The containers shall have a slotted lid or front panel allowing for the discarding of documents. The containers will be locked at all times and will have a design that will preclude the ability of hands reaching into the bins.  The containers must also be injection-molded to ensure extra strength and durability. 

The containers shall be locked and all shall be opened by the same key system. The COTR must be provided with a set of keys to gain entry into the containers if needed.  .  At no time will personnel from the contractor possess a duplicate key. Typically OPM will need 100-125 lockable shredding containers (64 gallon type) at the facility.  An additional 10% inventory of containers will be maintained on the premises for use as required.  Extra shredding containers will need to be available to handle extra supplies of paper to be shredded. All shred containers shall be given a unique number and be clearly labeled for manifesting purposes.

3.2	Shredding Standard

All paper submitted for shredding (to include PII) will be destroyed by shredding.  OPM Security standards require that the shredder must cross-cut the material to exceed a standard cross cut size of 1/8 X 1 1/8 - 2 (FIS Security Manual 9-3.) (NOTE: The material may contain an amount of contaminants consisting of mixed paper, staples, paper clips, black metal clips.

*A SAMPLE OF THE SHREDDED PRODUCT WILL BE REQUIRED PRIOR TO AWARDING OF THE CONTRACT.

4.	PII PROTECTION

The contractor shall be responsible for creating a manifesting process that will track the destruction schedule of each shred container.  The manifest must provide:

	Shred Bin identification number
	Contractor staff who received the bins at Staging Area
	Time/Date received from Staging Area by Shred Contractor
	Time/Date bin was shredded
	Contractor staff who shredded the bin
	Contractor staff members signature

The manifest shall be accessible to the COTR, or Oversight Representative, at any time during the contract period.

4.2	Shredding Practice

The contractor shall take all appropriate measures when handling the pre- and post-shredded material.  This includes, and is not limited to:

	Never leaving shred bins containing material unsupervised while outside OPM space or the shred area
	Unshredded material may be transported from the facility to the facility specific parking lot but may not be transported in an unshredded state from the facility specific parking lot.  As an example, material may not be transported from the Slippery Rock location to the Boyers location to be shredded.  The Slippery Rock material must be shredded in the Slippery Rock parking lot.

5.	QUALITY CONTROL

5.1	Contractor Quality Control

The contractor shall develop, submit for approval by OPM, and maintain quality control programs to ensure destruction and recycling services are performed in accordance with commonly accepted industry practices and FIS Security Manual (January2010.)

The COTR shall be objective, fair, and consistent in evaluating contractor performance against contract requirements and standards.  The main emphasis shall be placed both on security of the material and quality/timeliness of performance.  Contractor will have the ability to review performance evaluations on an agreed-upon interval (not to exceed quarterly) to fully realize OPMs performance expectations and standards.

5.3	Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan

This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) has been developed to provide the Quality Assurance Evaluator /COTR an effective and systematic surveillance method for each listed service.  The QASP describes a systematic method to evaluate the services the contractor is required to furnish.  

Quality Assurance is based on the premise that the contractor, and not OPM, is responsible for management and quality control actions to meet the terms of the contract.  

Any non-conformance with contract requirements is a defect.  A defect may be recorded for each item evaluated that failed to meet the standards as required by OPM.  Examples of defects that will be recorded include, but are not limited to: 

a.	Failure to perform a required task;
b.	Failure to take corrective action to prevent reoccurrence of less than satisfactory performance; or 
c.	Performance of less than satisfactory work (quality work consists of completing the work in accordance with the appropriate OPM requirements.)

1752.224-70	Protecting Personally Identifiable Information (May 2009)	

(a)	Applicability

This clause applies to contractor personnel and addresses specific OPM requirements in addition to those included in the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a - the Act).  The following should not be construed to alter or diminish civil and/or criminal liabilities provided under the Act.

(b)	Definition of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is information that can be used to discern or trace a person's identity, such as name, social security number, biometric records, and that combined with other information, can be used to compromise the integrity of agency records relating to a person, by permitting access to unauthorized disclosure of these records. For example, a name alone would generally not constitute PII, but when linked to his or her social security number, date of birth, or mother's maiden name, would constitute PII. In other words, PII refers to any information, on any medium, that identifies a specific individual whether the information is on paper or electronic. 

(c)	Responsibilities for Handling PII

(1)	Contract employees shall not remove PII from their individual assigned duty station without prior approval of their supervisor. 

(2)	All contract employees are personally responsible for the proper handling of PII, regardless of location.  All contract employees must be:

&#61607;	responsible for the proper control and handling of PII residing on their computer, on removable media, and on paper documents.

&#61607;	responsible for ensuring portable data storage and communication devices are properly controlled and secured at all times.

&#61607;	responsible for the proper marking, control and storage of printouts and other paper documents containing PII in their possession.

&#61607;	Email cannot be encrypted.  Since PII must be encrypted before being sent, send it only as an encrypted attachment.  Do not send PII in the content of an email.

(d)	Encryption of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

(1)	OPM has a policy protecting, and when appropriate, restricting sending, copying or moving PII from the OPM network.  Therefore, if the contract employees must send PII, send it only as an encrypted attachment.  OPM employees and contractors are required to encrypt PII data using WinZip.  Instructions on how to use WinZip to encrypt and protect files containing PII are available on Theo at: http://theo.opm.gov/helpdesk/selfhelp/WinZipv90EncryptionProcedures.pdf. WinZip can be used to protect data on workstations, laptops and email attachments.  It is available on all OPM workstations attached to the agencys network.   

(2)	A password protected file is not secure.  Never send any unencrypted PII data in e-mail.   

(e)	Procedures for Reporting a Breach of PII

(1)	A breach of PII includes loss of control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized acquisition, or unauthorized access of personally identifiable information whether physical or electronic.  As an agency, OPM is required to immediately report all potential PII data breaches -- whether they involve paper documents or electronic information.  In order to meet this responsibility, OPM has established a new internal procedure for reporting the loss or possible compromise of any PII, and this clause conforms to that procedure. 

(2)	OPM contractors must report any breach or potential breach to the OPM Situation Room and the Contracting Officer within 30 minutes of becoming aware of the risk  regardless of the time or day of the week.  Breaches should be reported, even if it is believed the breach is limited, small, or insignificant. OPMs IT security experts, who will determine when a breach needs additional focus and attention.  The OPM Situation Room is available 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. Report the breach to the OPM Situation Room and the Contracting Officer either by phone or by e-mail; however, be sure NOT to include PII in the e-mail.

(1)	All items that are confidential to business, or contain trade secrets, proprietary, or personnel information must be clearly marked in all documents submitted to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM or The Government).

<DESC>FLENUMMETOCCENs supercomputer suite reflects an investment of several million dollars of nodes, storage, networks, and related IT equipment. This acquisition is part of a network upgrade. Procurement of the proposed brand name components is consistent with the Commands System Integration Master Plan and will enhance FLENUMMETOCCENs information collection and delivery capabilities.

FLENUMMETOCCEN's supercomputers and the ability to connect them to DoD networks are at the heart of its mission-critical operational capability.  Cybersecurity and Information Assurance (IA) requirements are rigorous and unbending; if FLENUMMETOCCEN does not comply with IA guidance, the command can be disconnected from DoD networks, leading to total mission failure.
  In the networking realm, there are very few vendors and solutions allowed by higher authority.

Only the proposed F5 brand Big-IP product can provide the functions required for server load balancing and security functions. This will be expanded to support the Navy Enterprise Portal Oceanography (NEP-Oc) program. The functionality of the F5 brand product is also necessary to support operational and DISA IAVA security requirements.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br><br><br>SCOPE OF WORK<br>BLANKET PURCHASE AGREEMENT (BPA)<br><br>Between<br>Contractor<br>And<br>Western Regional Contracting Office<br><br>Contract Number BPA W91YU0-XX-A-XXXX<br><br>Authority<br><br>This agreement is established in accordance with FAR 13.303, Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA). It will be reviewed by the Contracting Officer at least once annually prior to the anniversary of the effective date, and revised to conform with all requirements of Statutes, Executive Orders, or the Federal Acquisition Regulation as updates occur. Any revisions will be incorporated by modification to this BPA.<br>The Government intends to establish multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) for various hard-to-find and those limited supply type pharmaceuticals.  NOTE: All pharmaceuticals purchased from BPA CALLs processed against the Master Blanket Purchase Agreement that will be issued from this Request for Quotation MUST be FDA approved.  Duration of the contracts will be for a base period, plus four one-year option periods, if exercised.<br><br>The Government will evaluate the packages submitted for this RFQ and issue a Master BPA to those contractors deemed acceptable.  In turn, those Master BPAs will be sent to the contractors for their acceptance.  No agreement will exist until both the Government and Contractor sign the order.  Master BPAs are not contracts and are not funded.  BPA CALLs will be issued including funding to order items from the processed Master Blanket Purchase Agreements.<br><br>Master BPAs entered into as a result of this Request for Quotation will establish multiple supply sources that will provide a streamlined method for procuring those hard-to-find and limited supply products as needed.   The objectives are to ensure availability and consistency of product for use in the Western Regional Medical Command at the best possible price while reducing processing time/workload for all parties, streamlining the payment process, and reducing vendor payment time.<br><br>The estimated cumulative amount for each awarded contract is $6,000,000.00 over the life of the contract <br><br>EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS<br><br>(a) The Government will select offerors to receive a contract resulting from this solicitation if the offeror is a responsible offeror who offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers (in the order of importance):<br><br>(1) Technical capability:  The ability to provide the items required, eg.. Hard-to-find pharmaceuticals, etc.<br>(2) Past Performance in areas of responsiveness and timely deliveries of required products.  Provide instances of emergency purchases (if possible).  Provide a minimum of three past contract awards or sales for this type of purchase (i.e. "hard-to-find", "in-short-supply").<br>(3) Pricing (Evaluation of pricing will be done at time of purchase by Government personnel.)  Submission of sample Line Card of products company can provide is requested.  Line Card will be used for informational purposes.<br><br>Technical and past performance, when combined, are rated higher than Price (as lives could depend upon the availability of certain pharmaceutical products).<br><br>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for selection purposes by evaluating the prices on the offeror's commercial price list and any offered discount.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br><br>INFORMATION TO QUOTERS:<br><br>1. Whenever the words "offer", "proposal", "offerors", or similar terms are used in this solicitation, they shall be read to mean "quote", "quotation", "quoter", "vendor" or similar corresponding term to reflect that this solicitation is a Request for Quotation, not a Request for Proposal or an Invitation for Bid.<br><br>2. Once the Contracting Officer has decided to whom a Master BPA will be issued, a bilateral BPA requiring the quoter's signature will be issued.  A Master BPA will be in existence once both the quoter and the Contracting Officer has signed the agreement.<br><br><br>The Master BPAs awarded from this solicitation will be for "hard-to-find" or "in short supply" type pharmaceuticals/Biologicals and injectables.   Sources of supply for the requestor is as follows:<br><br>(1) Prime Vendor<br>(2) Secondary Vendor<br>(3) Manufacturer<br><br>After required sources of supply are checked for products - and it is found that the product is not available or can only be received in a limited number and more is required - the Blanket Purchase Agreements can be used.  Only those items that are not available through the required sources or that are in short supply may be purchased under the BPAs.<br><br>The Point of Contact/Appointed Ordering Officer  will contact each BPA holder to verify current availability and pricing of each "hard-to-find" item.  The BPA CALL will be placed with the Contractor that can provide the items in a timely manner, at a price considered fair and reasonable.  The order will be placed with the Contractor that offers the best value to the Government.  CALLs may or may not be placed with the lowest priced Contractor, but placed with the Contractor that can provide the medications the quickest.  In some instances, the pharmaceuticals are needed in a 24 hour period (or less) and the availability is a "life or death" issue.  In the event of a standard delivery, availability and pricing will be the determining factors.  <br><br>*NOTE:  All Master BPA holders may or may not be contacted in an emergency situation in accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(2) Exceptions to the fair opportunity process.   The Contracting Officer will give every awardee a fair opportunity to be considered for an order exceeding $2,500 unless one of the statutory exceptions applies. <br><br>After issuance of  Master Blanket Purchase Agreement, a BPA CALL will be generated. The BPA CALL will be funded with an estimated amount of dollars to cover those "as required/as needed" items for a specific time frame.  The time frame will be set up on a Fiscal Year basis (1 Oct - 30 Sep).  BPA CALL values are estimated and ordering may or may not use all funding during the time frame covered.  Information concerning ordering and administration are covered under Section entitled "INFORMATION" located at the end of the solicitation.<br><br>The Contracting Officer has the authority to de-obligate excess funding unilaterally at the end of each BPA CALL.  This is covered in the Addendum to FAR 52.212-4 in the solicitation.<br><br>BACKGROUND:<br><br>Western Regional Medical Command  and Western Regional Contracting support the military population (and eligible family members) located in the Western Region  (CO, KS, MO, CA, AZ, WA, AK, and western part of TX) and the local civilian population in emergencies.  All the associated pharmacies (both in the hospital and the outlying clinics) purchase their pharmaceuticals through the Main Prime Vendor, Secondary Prime Vendor, or directly from the manufacturer.<br><br>As certain pharmaceuticals are required, it will occasionally fall upon the Department of Pharmacy to seek other than the directed sources of supply for those items that are included in a nationwide shortage or may be deemed too expensive through the directed sources.  Competition must be accomplished among distributors and is very time consuming.  Sometimes the requirement for certain pharmaceuticals is a life or death matter and the time spent looking for sources may cause injury or life threatening damages beyond repair.  A source of supply that can provide those "hard-to-find" items needs to be available at any time, day/night, weekends, etc. for those critically needed supplies that cannot be purchased through the Prime or Secondary Prime vendor or directly from the manufacturer.<br><br><br>GENERAL:<br><br>The contractor shall provide those hard-to-find or items that are short on supply nationwide as required (if in their power) for the Western Region.  Inability to provide those types of pharmaceuticals will not be viewed as a failure or in a negative manner against the contractor.  Master Blanket Purchase Agreements, established to allow maximum flexibility and efficiency in the procurement of such items.  The Government may place BPA CALLs to fund the estimated expenditures for the entire year with one order, or may place multiple BPA CALLs during the year for limited periods.  BPA CALLs will not cross fiscal years (except for required delivery time).<br><br>This contract uses a CLIN structure that allows purchase of all items within the scope of the items covered by this contract.  The quantity and types of items needed for those medical treatments and emergencies vary over time based on patient needs.  Each BPA CALL will be funded with a specific amount and allow the facility to place telephonic orders for specific requirements/emergencies against that BPA CALL until the funds are depleted.  This also allows for procurement of new items as technology advances without the need to modify the contract to include them.<br><br>Estimated item quantities and/or line item pricing will not be listed on the Master Blanket Purchase Agreement or CALL.  Delivery orders will reflect a number in the Quantity field equivalent to the number of dollars for which the delivery order is funded.  There is no expressed or implied guarantee that the purchases under the BPA CALL will exhaust all funds.   <br><br>New Products/Product Upgrades<br>The contractor will also provide to the Point of Contact/Appointed Ordering Officer  product literature for the new items and a detailed description of the differences between the new items and any existing items they replace or to which they can be compared, and a specific analysis of the comparative advantages/disadvantages of the items involved.<br><br>(1) Description of Agreement<br><br>a. Contractor shall provide those hard-to-find or items that are short on supply nationwide as required (if in their power) for the Western Region.  This agreement shall be in effect for a term of five (5) years, starting on 01 August 2011 through 31 July 2016. Agreement terms and conditions may be renegotiated annually prior to the anniversary of the effective date of the agreement.

<p>(End Addendum)</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>(a) Award Basis: The Government's evaluation of quotation will fully account for the evaluation factors identified and required under the Addendum to FAR 52.212-1. The evaluation of these factors will utilize the lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) award basis. Quotes that do not meet the quote specifics, will be deemed technically unacceptable, and therefore not considered for award.</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate quotations and award a contract without exchanges or communications and therefore, quotations should contain the vendor's best terms.</p>
<p>(b) Evaluation: Evaluation factors required under 52.212-1 will be evaluated by the Government as follows;</p>
<p>i. Price: To evaluate price reasonableness, a comparison will be made amongst all received quotations and the Government's estimate.</p>
<p>ii. Technical Qualification: A vendor's quotation will be considered technically acceptable if it meets the requirements detailed in paragraph C7 of the Addendum to FAR 52.121-1 above. Quotations that do not meet these requirements will be considered unacceptable and therefore, under the LPTA evaluation process, will not be considered for award.</p>
<p>(c) AWARD DETERMINATION: As a result of the Government's aforementioned evaluation, only those vendors whose quotes are determined to be technically qualified, and therefore technically acceptable, will be considered for award. No trade-offs will be permitted between price, and the non-price factor of technical capability. Of those vendors found technically acceptable, an award determination will be made to the lowest priced vendor that is determined to be reasonable, realistic, and affordable.</p>
<p>(End Provision)</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 13.004 -- Legal Effect of Quotations the following information is provided in regards to quotations.<br />A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer.</p>

<p>(End Addendum)</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>(a) Award Basis: The Government's evaluation of quotation will fully account for the evaluation factors identified and required under the Addendum to FAR 52.212-1. The evaluation of these factors will utilize the lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) award basis. Quotes that do not meet the quote specifics, will be deemed technically unacceptable, and therefore not considered for award.</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate quotations and award a contract without exchanges or communications and therefore, quotations should contain the vendor's best terms.</p>
<p>(b) Evaluation: Evaluation factors required under 52.212-1 will be evaluated by the Government as follows;</p>
<p>i. Price: To evaluate price reasonableness, a comparison will be made amongst all received quotations and the Government's estimate.</p>
<p>ii. Technical Qualification: A vendor's quotation will be considered technically acceptable if it meets the requirements detailed in paragraph C7 of the Addendum to FAR 52.121-1 above. Quotations that do not meet these requirements will be considered unacceptable and therefore, under the LPTA evaluation process, will not be considered for award.</p>
<p>(c) AWARD DETERMINATION: As a result of the Government's aforementioned evaluation, only those vendors whose quotes are determined to be technically qualified, and therefore technically acceptable, will be considered for award. No trade-offs will be permitted between price, and the non-price factor of technical capability. Of those vendors found technically acceptable, an award determination will be made to the lowest priced vendor that is determined to be reasonable, realistic, and affordable.</p>
<p>(End Provision)</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 13.004 -- Legal Effect of Quotations the following information is provided in regards to quotations.<br />A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer.</p>

<p>FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>(a) Award Basis: The Government's evaluation of quotation will fully account for the evaluation factors identified and required under the Addenda to FAR 52.212-1. The evaluation of these factors will utilize the lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) award basis. Quotes that do not meet the quote specifics, will be deemed technically unacceptable, and therefore not considered for award.</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate quotations and award a contract without exchanges or communications and therefore, quotations should contain the vendor's best terms.</p>
<p>(b) Evaluation: Evaluation factors for price and technical qualification as required under the addendum to 52.212-1 will be evaluated by the Government as follows;</p>
<p>i. Price: To evaluate price reasonableness, a comparison will be made amongst all received quotations and the Government's estimate.</p>
<p>ii. Technical Qualification: A vendor's quotation will be considered technically acceptable if it meets the requirements detailed in paragraph C7 of the Addendum to FAR 52.121-1 above. Quotations that do not meet these requirements will be considered unacceptable and therefore, under the LPTA evaluation process, will not be considered for award.</p>
<p>(c) AWARD DETERMINATION: As a result of the Government's aforementioned evaluation, only those vendors whose quotes are determined to be technically qualified, and therefore technically acceptable, will be considered for award. No trade-offs will be permitted between price, and the non-price factor of technical capability. Of those vendors found technically acceptable, an award determination will be made to the lowest priced vendor that is determined to be reasonable, realistic, and affordable.</p>
<p>(End Provision)</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 13.004 -- Legal Effect of Quotations the following information is provided in regards to quotations.<br />A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer. <br />If you have any questions or concerns, please contact one of the following:<br />Primary point of contact:<br />Contract Specialist: Keaston D.

<p>(End Addendum)</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>(a) Award Basis: The Government's evaluation of quotation will fully account for the evaluation factors identified and required under the Addenda to FAR 52.212-1. The evaluation of these factors will utilize the lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) award basis. Quotes that do not meet the quote specifics, will be deemed technically unacceptable, and therefore not considered for award.</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate quotations and award a contract without exchanges or communications and therefore, quotations should contain the vendor's best terms.</p>
<p>(b) Evaluation: Evaluation factors required under 52.212-1 will be evaluated by the Government as follows;</p>
<p>i. Price: To evaluate price reasonableness, a comparison will be made amongst all received quotations and the Government's estimate.</p>
<p>ii. Technical Qualification: A vendor's quotation will be considered technically acceptable if it meets the requirements detailed in paragraph C7 of the Addendum to FAR 52.121-1 above. Quotations that do not meet these requirements will be considered unacceptable and therefore, under the LPTA evaluation process, will not be considered for award.</p>
<p>(c) AWARD DETERMINATION: As a result of the Government's aforementioned evaluation, only those vendors whose quotes are determined to be technically qualified, and therefore technically acceptable, will be considered for award. No trade-offs will be permitted between price, and the non-price factor of technical capability. Of those vendors found technically acceptable, an award determination will be made to the lowest priced vendor that is determined to be reasonable, realistic, and affordable.</p>
<p>(End Provision)</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 13.004 -- Legal Effect of Quotations the following information is provided in regards to quotations.<br />A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer.</p>

<p>(End of Provision)<br />52.212-2 Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>(a) Award Basis: The Governments evaluation of quotations will fully account for the evaluation factors identified and required under 52.212-1 of 1.) Technical Capability , 2.) Past Performance, and 3.) Price. The evaluation of these factors will utilize an award basis that results in an award to the lowest priced technically acceptable quotation, that has been assigned an acceptable past performance rating. Quotes that do not meet the stated minimum technical specifications, will be deemed technically unacceptable, and therefore not considered for award. In addition, vendor's that are assigned an unacceptable past performance rating will not be considered for award. Finally, quotations that are incomplete and/or are determined to be priced unreasonably too high or too low, may not be selected for award. Therefore, quotations should contain the vendor's best terms, from a price, technical-specification, and past performance standpoint. Under the LPTA source selection process, trade-offs are not permitted, proposals are evaluated for acceptability but not ranked using the non-price factors.</p>
<p>(b) Evaluation: Evaluation factors required under 52.212-1 will be evaluated by the Government as follows;</p>
<p>i. Technical:</p>
<p>The government will evaluate technical proposals and the below listed sub-factors in accordance with the PWS on a pass/fail-basis, assigning ratings of acceptable, or unacceptable. An unacceptable rating for any of the below sub-factors will result in an unacceptable rating for this Technical Capability primary factor. Accordingly, under the LPTA source selection approach, vendors who receive an unacceptable rating for this factor, will not be considered for award. Technical Acceptability shall be evaluated against the following sub-factors:</p>
<p><br />Technical ratings will be evaluated entailing a comparison of quoted specifications with relation to specifications of the government's requirements, and qualifications. If the associated qualifications of any quoted service do not meet the Government's stated minimum qualification, may result in a vendor's entire quotation being ineligible for award.</p>
<p>As a result of the government's evaluation of the aforementioned Technical Capability sub-factors of Job Qualifications and all associated elements accordingly, a determination of acceptable of unacceptable will be assigned using the following ratings and descriptions:</p>
<p>Technical Capability Ratings<br />Rating Description<br />Acceptable Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.<br />Unacceptable Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>ii. Past Performance: Past performance ratings will be evaluated using the list of current/recent and relevant references provided by vendors. A telephone interview will be conducted by the government to evaluate each vendors past performance to determine whether or not the services met contract requirements, and also if the services were performed in accordance with prescribed performance schedules. The result of the assessment will determine if a vendor's past performance on recent and relevant contracts was favorable, or unfavorable. Failure by vendors to submit past performance information, or the inability to accurately reference points of contacts may result not being selected for award.</p>
<p>The evaluation of past performance information will result in an overall assessment of satisfactory or unsatisfactory as follows:</p>
<p>Past Performance Evaluation Ratings<br />Rating Description<br />Satisfactory Based on the vendor's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort<br />Unsatisfactory Based on the vendor's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>iii. Price: To evaluate price reasonableness and affordability, an initial screening of quotations will be performed to compare pricing to both Government and commercial web-based databases, and with comparison to the Government's estimate, and in relation to the product quoted. Quotations that are determined to be priced unreasonably, as either too high or too low, may not be selected for award.</p>
<p>(c) Award Determination: As a result of the Government's aforementioned evaluation, only those vendors whose proposals are determined to be technically acceptable and that have been assigned a satisfactory past performance rating, will be considered for award. Of those vendors found technically acceptable, and assigned satisfactory past performance ratings, award will be made to the lowest priced offeror whose price is determined reasonable and affordable.</p>
<p>A written notice of award or acceptance of a quotation, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful vendor within the time for acceptance specified in the quotation, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the vendor's specified expiration time, the Government may accept a quotation.<br />(End of Provision)</p>
<p><br />In accordance with FAR 13.004 -- Legal Effect of Quotations the following information is provided in regards to quotations.<br />A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer. <br />(End of Provision)</p>

<p><br /><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</strong> - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D.

<p>PAST PERFORMANCE:</p>
<p>The past performance evaluation will take into account the guidelines outlined at FAR 15.305(a) (2) Past Performance Evaluation. The contractor's past performance will be evaluated according to the following factors and questions:<br /><br />- Quality of Product or Service<br />Did the customer get what was specified?<br />Did the customer consider the final product high in quality?<br />If warranty issues arose, were they promptly corrected?<br />- Timeliness of Performance<br />Was the contract completed on time? If not, reason why not (growth work, contractor delayed, government delayed?)<br />- Business Relations<br />How was the customer service? Was the contractor committed to customer satisfaction?<br />Would you use this company again (Why/Why not)?<br />- Subcontracts<br />Were subcontracts involved? Comments?</p>
<p>In evaluating contractors past performance, the government intends to also review U.S. Coast Guard Contractor Performance Reports and other existing past performance ratings on relevant contracts. General trends in a contractor's performance will also be considered.</p>

Definite Items: These are items, which, if there is an award at all will be awarded. The proposal shall be evaluated to include the price for each definite item.</p>
<p>b. Composite Labor Hour Rate: The offeror shall be evaluated to include the offer price for the Composite Labor Hour Rate multiplied by the estimated quantity of hours.<br />c. Offeror's price shall represent the best price in response to the request for quotes. The price shall be evaluated to determine fairness and reasonableness</p>
<p>****Past Performance is approximately equal Price****</p>

<p>The Government may require the performance of the numbered line items, identified in the Schedule as option items, at the unit prices stated in the Schedule. The option quantities shown in the Schedule are estimates only. The Government has the right to require performance of these items at the quantities deemed necessary. Therefore, the Government may exercise an option item on more than one occasion during the contract performance period. The Contracting Officer will provide initial notification of the exercise of an option either verbally, by facsimile, or by e-mail. When time is of essence initial notification will be provided verbally followed within 24 hours by an e-mail or facsimile of confirmation. A contract modification will be executed shortly thereafter to include those options wherein exercise notification was provided. Such options may be exercised at any phase during the contract performance period as stated herein, or any extension of the performance period. To maintain the contract performance period the Contractor shall commence performance of an option item immediately upon receiving initial notification; but, not later than 24 hours thereafter, unless proper sequencing of the work requires a delay in beginning performance of the option. In that case, the option item shall be commenced as soon as proper sequencing permits. The exercise of any option item listed in the Schedule will not normally extend the contract performance period. However, the Contracting Officer may consider a request by the Contractor for contract extension if an option is exercised after 50% of the contract performance period has expired.</p>
<p>(End of Clause)</p>
<p>HSAR 3052.223-70 REMOVAL OR DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES - APPLICABLE LICENSES AND PERMITS (JUN 2006)</p>
<p>The Contractor shall have all licenses and permits required by Federal, state, and local laws to perform hazardous substance(s) removal or disposal services. If the Contractor does not currently possess these documents, it shall obtain all requisite licenses and permits within fifteen (15) days after date of award. The Contractor shall provide evidence of said documents to the Contracting Officer or designated Government representative prior to commencement of work under the contract.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p>REQUIRED INSURANCE</p>
<p>The Contractor shall, at its own expense, procure and maintain the following kinds of insurance with respect to performance under the contract. In accordance with HSAR 3052.228-70, Insurance (DEC 2003), the Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer with proof of insurance for the duration of the contract, including:<br />1. Ship Repairer's Liability - $500,000 per occurrence.<br />2. Comprehensive General Liability - $500,000 per occurrence.<br />3. Full insurance coverage in accordance with the United States' Longshoremen's and Harbor Worker's Act.<br />4. Full insurance coverage in accordance with the State's Workmen's Compensation Law (or its equivalent) for all places of performance under this contract.<br />The insurance certificate must provide the name of the US Coast Guard vessel and the contract and/or solicitation number as specifically insured.</p>
<p>INSPECTIONS</p>
<p>Except as specified elsewhere, the U.S. Coast Guard shall rely on the Contractor to accomplish all inspection and testing needed to ensure that the work conforms to contract quality requirements.</p>
<p>Records of all inspection work by the Contractor shall be kept complete and available to the Government during the term of this contract and for such longer period as may be specified elsewhere in this contract.</p>
<p>The name and telephone number of the U.S. Coast Guard Inspector will be provided after the award of a contract resulting from this solicitation.</p>
<p><br />GROWTH WORK</p>
<p>(a) The Contractor shall not perform growth work without the Contracting Officer's authorization. Growth work is work within the scope of the contract, which has not been previously priced as a pre-priced CLIN. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to contract for growth work on the basis of a negotiated, firm, fixed price, when it is in the best interest of the Government. If a firm-fixed price contract is awarded, and during the performance period a repair within scope is identified but the Contracting Officer and Contractor are unable to agree on the cost of the work, a bilateral modification may be incorporated into the contract using a Time and Materials modification for this specific repair. In this situation, FAR 52.212-4, Alternate I, will be incorporated.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall furnish a price breakdown directly to the Contracting Officer, itemized as required by the Contracting Officer, of any proposal submitted for a contract modification. Unless otherwise directed, the breakdown shall be submitted on an SFLC 002 proposal form provided at the arrival conference permitting an analysis of all materials, labor, equipment, subcontract, overhead costs, and profit covering all work involved in the change/modification whether such work was deleted, added or changed. Any amount claimed for subcontracts shall be supported by a separate, similar price breakdown. If the proposal includes a request for a time extension, justification shall be furnished with the proposal.</p>
<p>(c) This clause is to be used in conjunction with the clause COMPOSITE LABOR RATE incorporated into this solicitation. The Contractor is required to have and/or furnish all tools and equipment incidental to each bench trade. Supplies such as wiping rags, hacksaw blades, sandpaper, welding wire, helium, etc., are also to be furnished by the Contractor. Other materials are to be charged at regular rates and prices currently in effect and as agreed to by the Contracting Officer. Material shall be best commercial quality available except where a precise specification is indicated in which case the specification shall apply, e.g., MILSPEC, FEDERAL SPEC.</p>
<p>COMPOSITE LABOR RATE:</p>
<p>The composite labor rate offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the prime Contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The Contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the prime Contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.</p>
<p>(a) The composite labor hour rate shall represent total compensation for the following:<br />(1) direct labor wages and salaries;<br />(2) all employee benefits including, but not limited to, paid leave, supplemental pay, insurance, retirement, savings, and legally required benefits;<br />(3) other direct costs associated with transit time, delay, disruption, expendable supplies, and equipment;<br />(4) all indirect costs such as overhead and general and administrative expense;<br />(5) any port or association fees, rents, or other levies;<br />(6) profit (fee); and<br />(7) all direct and indirect costs and profit associated with the following support functions:<br />Supervision and Management Planning and Estimating<br />Material Handling Housekeeping<br />Engineering Transportation/Drivers<br />Quality Assurance Contract Administration<br />Security Testing</p>
<p>(b) The composite labor hour rate will be applied to production labor hours only. Production labor hours include only those hours necessary and reasonable to perform direct production functions and do not include the hours expended on the support functions listed above. This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the Contractor's accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.</p>
<p>(c) The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation. The Estimated Quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule and its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusion of this item does not obligate the Government to exercise the item nor entitle the Contractor to compensation if not exercised.</p>
<p>CONTRACTING OFFICER'S AUTHORITY</p>
<p>No oral or written statement of any person other than the Contracting Officer will in any manner or degree modify or otherwise affect the terms of this contract. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to approve changes in any of the requirements under this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, said authority remains solely with the Contracting Officer. In the event the Contractor effects any such change at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract price to cover any increase in cost incurred as a result thereof.</p>
<p>CONTRACT DEFICIENCY REPORT</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer or Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) may issue a Contract Deficiency Report (CDR), MLCA Form 005. The Contractor shall respond in writing within 24 hours of receipt, unless otherwise approved by the Contracting Officer, to the COTR. The COTR will comment on the Contractor's response and will forward the Deficiency Report and comments to the Contracting Officer, with a copy to the Contractor, the PBPL Availability Project Manager, and the NESU. The Contracting Officer will render a final determination and provide it to the Contractor and COTR in writing.</p>

<DESC>Notice of Intent:
The VAMC, Washington, DC, VISN 5, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 (Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Sciton for  The only multi-laser platform, which consists the wavelengths of 2940, 755, and broadband light with 420, 515, 560, 590, 640, 695. With the 2940, physicians perform full field resurfacing and fractional resurfacing with complete control of the thermal properties of the ablation and coagulation. Coagulation can be turned on or off {which cant be done with Co2 lasers} and the depth of ablation can be controlled from 4 microns up to 1500 microns. This is to be utilized for scar revision for our war wounded, acne scars, wrinkles and skin rejuvenation. The 755 alexandrite utilizes scanned technology for perfect spot placement and overlap control for hair removal firing up to 10 laser pulses per second.  This is used for hair removal and PFB. The BBL is the only pulsed light in the industry which incorporates dual flash lamps plus precise control of sapphire crystal temperatures from 0-30 degrees centigrade plus interchangeable on the fly wavelength guides plus magnetic snap on spot adapters which change the 15x45mm sapphire plate to spots ranging from 1.5 cm square to 7mm round to 11mm round. This is used for vascular lesions, pigmented lesions, active acne and hair removal.  The Sciton Joule is the only device on the market that provides this combination of wavelengths in a single laser platform with robotic scanned technology and precise control of photon energy with speed and depth of delivery of the individual wavelengths that is unparalleled.  The NAICS code 334510 applies. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. It is not a solicitation or a request for offerors. No solicitation package is available at this time. A determination not to compete is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations including the United Nations (UN) agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and man-made disaster situations. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Since 2002, frequent natural disasters and conflict have displaced populations and generated significant humanitarian needs throughout Afghanistan. Recurrent natural disasters in Afghanistan include drought, floods, landslides, earthquakes and avalanches which affect an average of 400,000 Afghans a year. The majority of individuals displaced under the Taliban regime returned home between 2001 and 2007, according to the UN. However, natural disasters and continued conflict have resulted in recurrent and protracted displacement. An intensification of conflict, particularly in southern regions, forced more than 100,000 individuals to flee their homes in 2010, according to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Center. In addition, between 5.5 million and 6 million refugees have returned to Afghanistan since 2002, according to the UN. In total, approximately 400,000 individuals are known to be displaced as of April 2011, although restricted humanitarian access impedes comprehensive displacement tracking.</p>
<p>Since 2001, USAID/OFDA has provided more than $260 million in humanitarian assistance to address the needs of returning populations, internally displaced persons, and other vulnerable populations affected by conflict and natural disasters in Afghanistan. USAID/OFDA-funded activities have included support for logistics and emergency relief commodities, responses to food insecurity, severe acute malnutrition, emergency health, shelter, water, sanitation and hygiene, as well as assistance to recover basic livelihoods. USAID/OFDA continues to support a three-pronged approach to improving humanitarian responses in Afghanistan by supporting a rapid response capacity to address acute needs following natural disasters and conflict, assisting communities and local civil society to better prepare for and mitigate the risks associated with natural disasters and enhancing humanitarian coordination and data collection and analysis so that disaster affected populations are identified and needs responded to quickly and appropriately.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>USAID/OFDA requires the services of a Senior Humanitarian Advisor based in Kabul, Afghanistan, to ensure that OFDA's objectives for disaster assistance, risk reduction, strategic reporting, interagency coordination, and situational analysis are met in the ongoing response.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>This position requires an individual who is able to reside in Kabul, Afghanistan, as determined in consultation with the Embassy and the Mission and subject to security and programmatic considerations. It also requires a willingness to travel within Afghanistan on short notice for possibly an extended period of time. The incumbent will serve as the primary contact and liaison for OFDA's ongoing humanitarian assistance activities in Afghanistan. The incumbent will work closely with the USAID/Afghanistan Mission, the Embassy's Refugee Coordinator, international organizations (IOs), non governmental organizations (NGOs), the UN, and NATO-led forces where appropriate, to respond to humanitarian needs and sudden onset disasters. The Senior Humanitarian Advisor will be responsible for program analysis, program monitoring, oversight of program implementation, as well as reporting to OFDA Washington, the Europe, Middle East, and Central Asia (EMCA) Regional Office in Budapest, Hungary, the USAID Afghanistan Mission and, as required, U.S. Embassy staff.</p>
<p>The Senior Humanitarian Advisor will serve as the primary point of contact for OFDA implementing partners working in Afghanistan and will monitor, evaluate and report on OFDA-funded programs. This position requires substantial coordination with representatives from other USAID offices, the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA), Provincial Regional Teams (PRTs), District Stabilization Teams (DSTs), as well as with relevant UN and NGO agencies, therefore requiring a highly collaborative work style. The Senior Humanitarian Advisor must be prepared to function effectively in a challenging and restrictive work environment and be willing to strictly adhere to U.S. Embassy security and travel policies.</p>
<p>Working directly under the guidance and supervision of the Principal Regional Advisor for EMCA, the incumbent will:</p>
<p>&bull; Serve as the principal point of contact for OFDA in Afghanistan for humanitarian issues, and serve as a liaison on program issues among the USAID mission, U.S. Embassy, NATO-led coalition forces, OFDA/Washington, and the overall humanitarian community.<br />&bull; Lead efforts to identify and assess humanitarian assistance requirements and target beneficiary groups and locations, and existing relief programs, and recommend the types of interventions and budget levels necessary to support OFDA's programs in Afghanistan. <br />&bull; Supervise relevant foreign national program staff within the Kabul OFDA Program Office.<br />&bull; Monitor ongoing programs and the overall humanitarian assistance landscape in Afghanistan. Regularly review partner's reports, coordinate with OFDA/EMCA regional office, and OFDA/Washington on issues of mutual interest, and provide coordinated Washington and field feedback to the partners.<br />&bull; Coordinate closely with OFDA/EMCA regional office, OFDA/Washington, the USAID Mission, PRTs, DSTs, the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, and NATO Forces as well as UN agencies, IOs and NGOs working in Afghanistan.<br />&bull; Coordinate collection of information and provide updates and recommendations through written reports on issues related to the humanitarian situation, including the following:</p>
<p>o Capacity and level of activity of local institutions to carry out relief programs;<br />o Capacity and ability of UN, IOs, and NGOs to carry out programs;<br />o Capacity of the logistics infrastructure to support programs;<br />o Security situation of personnel, convoys, and relief operations in general;<br />o Impact of the GIRoA activities on humanitarian programs; <br />o Contributions by other donors, problems arising from implementation of relief programs, and any other issues that require the attention of OFDA; and <br />o Humanitarian coordination issues and any recommendations for change.</p>
<p>&bull; Provide guidance to organizations that are developing proposals for OFDA, based on OFDA's Guidelines for Unsolicited Proposals and Reporting; review concept papers and proposals and provide timely recommendations/comments to OFDA/ Washington.<br />&bull; Present OFDA perspectives to NGOs, IOs, and UN agencies relating to humanitarian assistance strategies, priorities and technical requirements. Work closely with OFDA/Washington Technical Assistance Group (TAG) and Principal Regional Advisor to discuss and understand sectoral priorities.<br />&bull; Visit OFDA-funded projects, as security permits, and report on a timely basis to the EMCA regional team on the quality of grantees' work, noting deficiencies, attributes, and evolving operational conditions. <br />&bull; Represent U.S. Government (USG) humanitarian interests at national meetings and conferences, and facilitate, as requested, travel and briefings for official USG visitors interested in humanitarian issues.<br />&bull; Maintain regular liaison with UN, NGOs, IOs, GIRoA, and other organizations regarding humanitarian activities.<br />&bull; Maintain regular, close coordination and communication with OFDA/Washington EMCA regional offices and OFDA's military liaison officers at U.S. Central Command. <br />&bull; Contribute to field reports on trends, individual agency programming issues, and topics such as humanitarian protection and coordination.<br />&bull; Submit situation reports and assessment reports whenever necessary, including official reporting cables as the situation warrants.<br />&bull; Have the ability to operate standard field communications equipment; may be required to operate a four-wheel drive, standard shift vehicle in cross-country conditions.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Senior Humanitarian Advisor will report directly to the OFDA Principal Regional Advisor for the EMCA Region in Budapest, Hungary. However, for many activities, the Senior Humanitarian Advisor will coordinate tasks directly with personnel within USAID/Afghanistan, and in collaboration and consultation with other USAID and U.S. embassy staff. The Senior Humanitarian Advisor does not have the authority to commit OFDA resources without approval from OFDA/Washington.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />Supervisory controls will be minimal. The Senior Humanitarian Advisor is expected to act independently with minimal direction and will have wide latitude for the exercise of independent judgment. The OFDA Principal Regional Advisor for EMCA will provide direction in terms of broadly defined program goals and objectives.</p>
<p>10. PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. During deployment on DARTs (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>11. WORK ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>Work is primarily performed in an office setting. During deployment on DARTs (if required), and during site visits, the work may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>QUESTIONS& Answers:<br><br>Question#1:For the Post-Wide Propane CLINS: 0001, 1001, 2001, 3001 & 4001, do you want us to propose the Propane Terminal Price only?  Do you have a terminal in mind you want to peg this on?<br><br>Answer: Please propose the cost to the government for the propane. For example, if we were to come pick up the propane and no delivery was involved, what would you sell us the propane for? This should include your cost for the propane, overhead and profit for the propane only.<br><br>Question#2:  For the Propane Delivery CLINS: 0002, 1002, 2002, 3002 & <br>4002, does this delivery CLIN include all other charges such as:  admin, <br>margin, hazmat. etc...?<br><br>Answer: This CLIN is the cost for the delivery of the product. This would also include any charges relating to the delivery of the product to include, labor, gasoline, etc. Profit and overhead for the propane is already accounted for in CLIN 0001. <br><br>Question#3: What is the Post-wide Propane (CLINS: 0001, 1001, 2001, 3001 & 4001) <br>Price Terms going to be?  <br><br>Answer: These are firm-fixed-price CLINS with an EPA. The clause 52.216-4 is included in the contract and provides for up to an 18% aggregate increase from the original cost of the propane. This increase is given only to the contractor's actual cost of the propane. As the prices decrease the government is owed a decrease in price as well.<br><br><br><br><br>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Commandant (CG-931) U.S. Coast Guard HeadquartersProcurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half Street, SW, JR11-0203<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3692</p>

<DESC><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This sources sought synopsis has been updated as of 15 June 2011. The updates are underlined in the notice below. Please respond ONLY if you can provide ALL requirements listed below. </span></p>
<p>F-16 Mission Training Center (MTC) Follow-on Services Sources Sought Notice</p>
<p>Description<br />I. Sources Sought Synopsis: This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS), no solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the US Government to form a binding contract. Companies that respond will not be paid for the information submitted.</p>
<p>a) The Government is conducting market research to identify, as potential sources, companies that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to competently and competitively respond to requirements to provide training services for F-16 Mission Training Centers (MTC) following the end of the existing MTC services contract in October 2012. Only United States companies will be considered for contract award. <br />b) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and Proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Companies responding to this market research are advised that participation does not ensure participation in future solicitations or contract awards. The Government will not reimburse any company or individual for any expenses associated with preparation or participation in this research. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this SSS.<br />c) Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this Sources Sought Synopsis, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal. <br />d) Background: The F-16 MTCs are currently operating at the following Air Force Bases: Shaw, Misawa, and Spangdahlem. The F-16 MTCs are part of the Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) Program. DMO is an operational readiness initiative that networks geographically separated training devices in a real-time synthetic battlefield. It is scalable to provide individual, team, and team-of-teams combat training and mission rehearsal. It is the backbone for the Virtual Flag exercise used for AEF spin-up and the cornerstone of the AF training transformation. The F-16 MTC Integrated Product Team at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is responsible for fielding aircrew training device capability that ensures the trainers maintain concurrency with the aircraft co-located at each base. Currently this capability is provided through a training simulation services contract that meets the Air Force requirements. This contract is programmed to end in October 2012.</p>
<p>e) The Government anticipates a FAR Part 15, services contract with a total delivery period of no fewer than <span style="text-decoration: underline;">one (1) year</span> and no more than three (3) years (one base year period with four six month options).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">f) ALL CURRENT MTC EQUIPMENT IS CONTRACTOR OWNED, in the required aircraft platform configuration and DMO standards, therefore no equipment will be provided by the Government. Any potential offeror must be able to provide fully operational F-16 units to the Air Force.</span> All services will be housed in Government facilities and utilized by personnel designated by the government. Government-contracted instructors, separate from this acquisition, will use all aspects of the services in preparation for and conduct of lessons.</p>
<p>g) Payment for training services under this contract will commence with start of service at each site.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">h) The purpose of this SSS is to determine offeror interest in providing training service support on contractor-owned fully operational F-16 MTC units to the Air Force. </span></p>
<p>II. Program Requirements:</p>
<p>a) This document specifies the performance requirements for the United States Air Force (USAF) F-16 Block 50 Mission Training Center (MTC) System Services that provide interim training services between the current contract, FA8621-07-D-6272, and the Full-Up F-16 Block 40/42/50/52 System Procurement contract. In this document the term Block 50 refers to F-16 Block 50/52. System Services refers to the total services provided under this contract, to include, but not limited to F-16 MTC simulation, security, mission control, and support capabilities. An F-16 Mission Training Center (MTC) shall consist of a four-ship F-16 system simulation along with scenario generation capability and two briefing/debriefing stations. Each System Simulation will consist of a representation of the appropriate F-16 aircraft model, both cockpit and software simulation, Instructor Operator Station (IOS), and a synthetic environment. Each F-16 MTC shall support basic and advanced mission training, tactics validation, operational test and evaluation, exercise support, and mission rehearsal, to include but not limited to, all weapons, internal and/or external sensors, communication systems, avionics systems associated with the F-16 Block 50, and operation in both local and Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) environments. Each F-16 MTC constitutes a DMO Federate System that can interoperate with other geographically distributed DMO Federate Systems, as part of a larger DMO Federation linked by the DMO Network (DMON), to provide real-time combat team training during scheduled DMO Events. The F-16 MTC shall provide a four ship system simulation that is capable of single-ship, local multi-ship, and long-haul multi-ship (DMO) training and mission operations at each operating location. The system simulation shall provide an ownship simulation; a realistic, high-fidelity synthetic environment with synthetic forces; all avionics and weapons; an IOS to control each cockpit; and a visual system with the full field-of-view (FOV) experienced by the pilot in the aircraft. System service at an operating location shall provide two brief/debrief rooms per F-16 MTC and a scenario generation system that is compatible with aircraft mission planning systems.<br />b) The F-16 MTC shall support tactics validation, operational test and evaluation, exercise support, and mission rehearsal. For training, the F-16 MTC shall support Formal Training Unit (FTU) skills: transition, operation of aircraft sensors/systems, air-to-air, and air-to-ground, communications, data links, electronic system interface, or any other F-16 weapons system interactions. <br />c) The system service shall support real-time virtual combat training by aircrew and other DMO participants. F-16 MTC system latency shall be minimized such that critical combat simulation interactions are realistic and accurate. This includes system internal and external interactions related to visual perception, communication, data links, electronic system interface, sensor and sensor jamming, electronic counter measures, or any other weapons system interactions that might incorrectly influence the outcome of an exercise or engagement during a local or DMO Events. F-16 MTC system latency shall not be detectable by the pilots during local training. F 16 MTC system latency shall not create false or unrealistic results with combat interactions during DMO Events.<br />d) The system services capabilities shall be concurrent with F-16CM Block 40/50 M5.2+ at the MP09 DMO standard.<br /><br />1) Cockpits. The F-16 MTC shall provide high-fidelity cockpit representations of the F-16 Block 50 aircraft cockpits, including controls, displays, and avionics. Cockpit components shall provide high physical (3-dimensional) and functional fidelity of the actual F-16 Block 50 aircraft. This shall include as a minimum, map case, air conditioning vents, and ejection seat pitot booms. Ejection seat hardware shall support strapping in with existing F-16 life support gear, but is not required to be fully functional. The cockpits shall support aircrew chemical warfare (CW) training requirements and be compatible with actual CW equipment worn by the aircrew using the unmounted CW equipment (MBU-19P) internal batteries to provide the airflow. Cockpit controls, displays, and lighting (including external lighting effects) shall support all modes of employment including day and night vision operations.</p>
<p>2) Synthetic Environment. The F-16 MTC shall include a realistic, high fidelity synthetic environment capable of supporting a full range of mission training and operations for day/night, low altitude, and all-weather missions for the full range of weapon systems and sensors.

<p>F-16 Mission Training Center (MTC) Follow-on Services Sources Sought Notice</p>
<p>Description<br />I. Sources Sought Synopsis: This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS), no solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the US Government to form a binding contract. Companies that respond will not be paid for the information submitted.</p>
<p>a) The Government is conducting market research to identify, as potential sources, companies that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to competently and competitively respond to requirements to provide training services for F-16 Mission Training Centers (MTC) following the end of the existing MTC services contract in October 2012. Only United States companies will be considered for contract award. <br />b) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and Proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Companies responding to this market research are advised that participation does not ensure participation in future solicitations or contract awards. The Government will not reimburse any company or individual for any expenses associated with preparation or participation in this research. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this SSS.<br />c) Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this Sources Sought Synopsis, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal. <br />d) Background: The F-16 MTCs are currently operating at the following Air Force Bases: Shaw, Misawa, and Spangdahlem. The F-16 MTCs are part of the Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) Program. DMO is an operational readiness initiative that networks geographically separated training devices in a real-time synthetic battlefield. It is scalable to provide individual, team, and team-of-teams combat training and mission rehearsal. It is the backbone for the Virtual Flag exercise used for AEF spin-up and the cornerstone of the AF training transformation. The F-16 MTC Integrated Product Team at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is responsible for fielding aircrew training device capability that ensures the trainers maintain concurrency with the aircraft co-located at each base. Currently this capability is provided through a training simulation services contract that meets the Air Force requirements. This contract is programmed to end in October 2012.</p>
<p>e) The Government anticipates a FAR Part 15, services contract with a total delivery period of no fewer than <span style="text-decoration: underline;">one (1) year</span> and no more than three (3) years (one base year period with four six month options).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">f) ALL CURRENT MTC EQUIPMENT IS CONTRACTOR OWNED, in the required aircraft platform configuration and DMO standards, therefore no equipment will be provided by the Government. Any potential offeror must be able to provide fully operational F-16 units to the Air Force.</span> All services will be housed in Government facilities and utilized by personnel designated by the government. Government-contracted instructors, separate from this acquisition, will use all aspects of the services in preparation for and conduct of lessons.</p>
<p>g) Payment for training services under this contract will commence with start of service at each site.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">h) The purpose of this SSS is to determine offeror interest in providing training service support on contractor-owned fully operational F-16 MTC units to the Air Force. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />F-16 Mission Training Center (MTC) Follow-on Services Sources Sought Notice</p>
<p>Description<br />I. Sources Sought Synopsis: This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS), no solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the US Government to form a binding contract. Companies that respond will not be paid for the information submitted.</p>
<p>a) The Government is conducting market research to identify, as potential sources, companies that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to competently and competitively respond to requirements to provide training services for F-16 Mission Training Centers (MTC) following the end of the existing MTC services contract in October 2012. Only United States companies will be considered for contract award. <br />b) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and Proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Companies responding to this market research are advised that participation does not ensure participation in future solicitations or contract awards. The Government will not reimburse any company or individual for any expenses associated with preparation or participation in this research. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this SSS.<br />c) Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this Sources Sought Synopsis, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal. <br />d) Background: The F-16 MTCs are currently operating at the following Air Force Bases: Shaw, Misawa, and Spangdahlem. The F-16 MTCs are part of the Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) Program. DMO is an operational readiness initiative that networks geographically separated training devices in a real-time synthetic battlefield. It is scalable to provide individual, team, and team-of-teams combat training and mission rehearsal. It is the backbone for the Virtual Flag exercise used for AEF spin-up and the cornerstone of the AF training transformation. The F-16 MTC Integrated Product Team at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is responsible for fielding aircrew training device capability that ensures the trainers maintain concurrency with the aircraft co-located at each base. Currently this capability is provided through a training simulation services contract that meets the Air Force requirements. This contract is programmed to end in October 2012.</p>
<p>e) The Government anticipates a FAR Part 15, services contract with a total delivery period of no fewer than <span style="text-decoration: underline;">one (1)</span> year and no more than three (3) years (one base year period with four six month options).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">f) ALL CURRENT MTC EQUIPMENT IS CONTRACTOR OWNED, in the required aircraft platform configuration and DMO standards, therefore no equipment will be provided by the Government. Any potential offeror must be able to provide fully operational F-16 units to the Air Force.</span> All services will be housed in Government facilities and utilized by personnel designated by the government. Government-contracted instructors, separate from this acquisition, will use all aspects of the services in preparation for and conduct of lessons.</p>
<p>g) Payment for training services under this contract will commence with start of service at each site.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">h) The purpose of this SSS is to determine offeror interest in providing training service support on contractor-owned fully operational F-16 MTC units to the Air Force. </span></p>

<a href="mailto:david.e.hansen1@us.army.mil">ACC-APG (C4ISR)</a>
<DESC>The following are responses to Draft Section L & M questions from industry received as of May 13, 2011, 1500 Eastern Standard Time.<br><br>Q1: Draft Section L (2)(c)(iii)(a)  - " The Offeror shall submit a Microsoft 2007 Excel file (workbook) that calculates and includes the formulas necessary to develop a summary worksheet (single tab within workbook) which provides the 'Summary of Total Price by Cost Element by CLIN by WBS'." <br><br>Does the Government intend to provide an Excel 2007 workbook with the final RFP that is formatted in the manner that the Government wishes to receive the Cost/Pricing data as described in this section?<br><br>R1: YES<br><br>Q2: Draft Section L (2)(c)(iii)(a)  - "..This 'Summary of Total Price by Cost  Element by CLIN by WBS' worksheet will have for each Cost Element a reference to a worksheet (single tab within workbook) containing the supporting calculations, formulas, and line item details necessary for the government to evaluate the individual components of the Cost Element by CLIN by Fiscal Year and by WBS. (See Attachment 4 - workbook)<br><br>Will the Government provide the referenced workbook in Attachment 4 with the Final RFP?  <br><br>R2: YES<br><br>Q3: If so, does this workbook include detail worksheet and structure for each Cost Element as requested in the referenced paragraph?  <br><br>R3: YES<br><br>Q4: Draft Section L (2)(c)(iii)(a) ii. Direct Material (2nd paragraph) - "Each priced summary will include the part number once with the total proposed number of units for the WBS". <br><br>Will the Government please explain the requirement to "...include the part number once"?  Is the Government expecting a single part number for each level of the WBS, of which the required part will be defined in the Final RFP?  Or does the Government want a collapsed Bill of Materials by Part Number with quantities of each for each level of the WBS?<br><br>R4: The Government requires a collapsed Bill of Materials by Part Number with quantities of each for each level of the WBS.<br><br>Q5: Draft Section L (2)(c)(iii)(a) v. Indirect Costs - "...For each Indirect Cost (example Fringe, Overhead, Material/Subcontract Handling, General and Administrative, Facilities Capital Cost of Money, etc.,) identify the indirect rates from your Forward Pricing Rate Agreement (FPRA) or forward Pricing Rate Proposal (FPRP) applied to each respective Cost Element that were used to calculate the Indirect Costs."<br><br>Will the Government accept a Forward Pricing Rate Proposal that defines Activity Rates (not separated into overhead, fringe, etc.) as an adequate submission for this requirement?<br><br>R5: No, the Government requires the offeror to propose indirect rates on an individual basis.  <br><br>Q6: Draft Section L (2)(c)(iii)(d) - " The offeror shall submit a sanitized version of the Excel files detailed in paragraphs A, B, and C. NO PRICE DATA (RATES/SUMMARY DOLLARS) shall be included in the SANITIZED Files."<br><br>Will the Government please provide more detail on the data that will need to be excluded in the "sanitized" version?  <br><br>R6: All monetary values must be excluded.<br><br>Q7: Will the Government please provide detail of what data should be included in the sanitized files?<br><br>R7:  Everything excluding all monetary values. <br><br>Q8: Reference page 3, Table 1.  We assume there will be one (1) file for the Technical Volume that will contain:<br><br>Table of Contents for all information in the Technical Volume including Sample Task 1, 2, and 3 and not a separate Table of Contents for each.  Is this correct? <br><br>R8: YES<br><br>Q9: Will attachments such as Block Diagrams, Equipment Specification Sheets, be counted in the page count?<br><br>R9:  Any information the Offeror feels necessary to accurately describe its response to the final RFP should be included and all information will be considered as part of the page count. <br><br>Q10: Reference page 3, Paragraph 2, Page Count.  How will the number of lines per page be determined? Word will indicate line numbers: however, spaces are counted as well. Draft Section L, 2 Proposal Files, b, page 3<br><br>R10: The Government will use Word format to count the number of lines. Draft section L 2. Proposal files, paragraph 2 defines the amount of spacing to be provided and only TEXT will be removed.<br><br>Q11: Will the table of contents be included as part of the page count for the Technical and Past Performance Volumes?  Will a cover page and other informational list (list of figures, list of tables, list of acronyms, etc.) count in the total number of allowed pages?<br><br>R11:  The table of contents does not count as part of the page count<br>Lists of figure, tables and acronyms do not count as part of the page count.<br><br>Q12: Draft Section L, (ii) Volume II - Past Performance, (e), page 6<br>The Performance Risk Assessment Questionnaires are to be included in the proposal Past Performance file.  Will these pages count in the total number of allowed pages?<br><br>R12: Per Draft Section L (ii) Volume II - Past Performance, (e), page 6, the completed questionnaires will not be counted as part of the total page count.  In addition the Questionnaires will no longer be the Offerors responsibility.<br><br>Q13:  Regarding OCI, can a prime bidder exclude itself from individual RTEPs/Task Orders if it feels there would be a conflict of interest on that particular Task Order?<br><br>R13: Yes<br><br>Q14:  Small Business Participation Plan.  Is a Small Business Participation Plan to be submitted only for each of the Sample Tasks or is a Small Business Participation Plan also required for the overall IDIQ total effort?  If also required for the total IDIQ effort what values should be used for plan figures.  The same questions also arise for large businesses required to also submit a Small Business Subcontracting Plan.<br><br>R14:   The SB plan is for the overall effort - not for each individual Sample Task.<br><br>Q15:  Pricing.  Your instruction is for offerors to submit "Cost, Cost Plus, and Firm-Fixed Prices for its proposed notional systems/equipment in response to the three Sample Tasks provided with the RFP".  Is this to be understood as requiring three proposals for each of the Sample Tasks or will each task have a specified contract type associated with it?<br><br>R15:  No, only one proposal is to be submitted. There will be only one type of contract for each sample task which will be provided in the final RFP. <br><br>Q16: Pricing.  Is it acceptable to submit a Word document Price Volume along with the Excel spreadsheet which contains the requested supporting information? Can the Word document submission include printouts of the pricing file worksheets to accompany explanations of the basis used to develop the pricing?  Is a sanitized version of the Word document Volume desired along with the sanitized Excel spreadsheet?<br><br>R16: No- see pricing proposal instructions provided in the draft  L&M , in addition a sanitized version of all submittals must be provided. <br><br>Q17: Pricing. The instructions refer to preparing pricing for each Cost Element by Fiscal Year.  Is the fiscal year being referred here the Government fiscal year or the offeror's fiscal year?<br><br>R17: For each Sample Task, a Cost Detail workbook that contains price summaries by lowest proposed Work Breakdown Structure  (WBS) level detailing the Cost Elements by Contractor Fiscal Year (ST1_Cost Detail.xls, ST2-Cost Detail.xls, and ST3_Cost Detail.xls) shall be proposed.<br><br>Q18: Reference: draft M.C.3.b explains how the total evaluated price shall be calculated by multiplying the evaluated proposed price for each Sample Task by a weighted multiplier.  It also states "Based on historical data and future projections for task orders over the life of the base contract, each multiplier represents the relative contribution of the work in each Sample Task to the overall effort."<br><br>The multiplier for STO3 is .20, which indicates that historical data and future projections for Sustainment are set at 20% of the total effort.  However, in the Q&A released on 16 February 2011, the Government stated:<br><br>Q/C52. What is the expected mix of Material Purchase vs. Services provided? During Industry day in July 2010, the KO had announced a 60% Material and a 40% Services mix. Will this stay the same of some other anticipated mix?<br> <br>R18: The mix and percentages will be clarified as part of the final RFP.<br><br>Q19: Recommend that the government adjust the STO 3 multiplier to .30 and reduce the multipliers for STO 1 and/or STO 2 to more accurately reflect the anticipated 70%-30% mix of Material and Service.<br><br>R19: The contracting officer will take this under consideration. <br><br>Q20: Volume I Technical<br>1.) Reference: Draft PWS (released 14 January 2011) Section 3.14.3 states "Unless otherwise specified by the Government, the TEP size shall not exceed twenty (20) total text pages."  However, the table in Draft L Section 2.b shows a 30 page limit for STO 1, 25 pages per STO 2, and 25 pages for STO 3.<br>Question: Please confirm that the government is requesting a 20 page TEP for each STO.  And if so, what information should be included in the 10 additional pages for STO 1 and 5 additional pages for STO 2 and STO 3?<br><br>R20: Refer to Draft Section L proposal submission instructions table 2<br><br>Q21: Reference: Draft L.2.c Part (i) VOLUME I - TECHNICAL states "The Offeror shall provide its Technical Proposal (Volume I) in a separate file as specified in Table 1 above an executive summary as well as addressing the information below separately for each Sample Task 1, 2, & 3." Question: Please clarify if a separate Executive Summary is required for each Sample Task response.<br><br>R21: A single Executive Summary shall be provided addressing brief overview of the entire proposal to include the Sample Tasks.   Executive Summary section is included as part of the overall page count.<br><br>Q22: Volume II Past Performance<br>1.) Reference: Draft L.2.c part (ii) VOLUME II - PAST PERFORMANCE states "For all contracts identified in Section 1, Performance Risk Assessment Questionnaires must be completed and submitted with the Offeror's proposal submission."<br>Question: Please confirm that the Performance Risk Assessment Questionnaires do not count toward the total page limitation as specified for Volume II (Past Performance) per section L?<br><br>R22:  Per draft section L (ii) Volume II - Past Performance, (e), page 6, the completed questionnaires will not be counted as part of the total page count.  In addition the Questionnaires will no longer be the Offerors responsibility.<br><br>Q23: Reference: Draft L.2.c part (ii) VOLUME II - PAST PERFORMANCE states "Sections 1 & 2 of this file shall contain the Offeror's description of all Government and commercial contracts (prime contracts and subcontracts awarded or ongoing within three years prior to the date of issuance of this solicitation) that are relevant to the efforts required by this solicitation."<br>Question: Will the government consider a page limit applied per reference (Section 1 & 2) to help ensure a more consistent evaluation of references between all offerors?  (Note that, by itself, the 50 page limit for Volume II may result in reference descriptions of different lengths, depending on how many references an offeror submits.)<br><br>R23: The Government Contracting Officer will take this recommendation under consideration.<br><br>Q24: Reference: Draft L.2.c part (ii) VOLUME II - PAST PERFORMANCE states "Relevancy is defined as those development, production and sustainment tasks defined in the PWS and sample tasks attached to the RFP include efforts similar in complexity and technology to the GTACS Contract."<br>Question: This definition of relevancy is not clear.  We suggest the government rephrase to "Relevancy is defined as similar in scope to the tasks defined in the PWS and sample tasks attached to the RFP, and similar in complexity and technology to the GTACS Contract."<br><br>R24: The definition of Relevancy will be revised in the final RFP to make it clearer.<br><br>Q25: Volume III Small Business Participation Plan<br>1.) Reference: In accordance with DFARS 215.304, both large and small businesses are required to submit a Small Business Participation Plan.  As such, draft section L requires Offerors to include "Business Development (BD) Program" companies in their SBPP.<br>Question: Please confirm that the "Business Development (BD) Program" referenced in Draft Section L is the same as the 8(a) program referenced in Draft Section M.<br><br>R25: Section L&M have been revised for the final RFP. <br><br>Q26:  Reference: Draft L.2.c part (iv) - VOLUME III - SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION PLAN includes a matrix to propose Small Business Participation Goals.<br>Question: What is the government's definition of "Total Contract Value" as it relates to completing this matrix?<br><br>R26: Section L&M have been revised for the final RFP.<br><br>Q27: Reference: Draft L.2.c part (iv) - VOLUME III - SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION PLAN includes a separate matrix to demonstrate HBCU/MI target participation.<br>Question: Please confirm the Government's intent to require the utilization of HBCU/MI organizations as part of the offeror's Small Business Participation Plan per draft section L. And if so, how will they be evaluated since they are not currently mentioned in Draft Section M?<br><br>R27: Section L&M have been revised for the final RFP.<br><br>Q28: Reference:  Draft Section L.2.c(ii) VOLUME II-PAST PERFORMANCE (FACTOR)<br><br>Question:  Please clarify the requirement for the "Sections 1 & 2 of this file shall contain the Offeror's description of all Government and commercial contracts (prime contracts and subcontracts awarded or ongoing within three years prior to the date of issuance of this solicitation) that are relevant to the efforts required by this solicitation. <br><br>Does the Government intend for offeror's to submit all their contracts, which will be hundreds, or does the Government intend to request three - five of the most relevant?  <br><br>R28: There are no limits to the number of contracts that can be submitted; However the Offeror should use their best judgment with regards to recent and relevant data.<br><br>Q29: Will teaming partners/subcontractors be required to submit all their contracts within three years?<br><br>R29: Refer to submission instruction in draft Section L<br><br>Q30: Will past performance questionnaires be required for all submitted past performance references?<br><br>R30: The collection of Past performance questionnaires will now be the responsibility of the Government in the final RFP. <br><br>Q31: The government has requested that the Cost/Proposal in "Volume IV - Cost-Price (Factor)" be provided in the form of a Microsoft 2007 Excel file which shall include the detail data and calculations building to the submitted pricing.  In lieu of a Microsoft 2007 Excel file, will the government consider submission of the Cost Element supporting data and calculations in the form of reporting from an industry standard government costing and pricing software tool such as ProPricer which utilizes source data (including indirect rates) that tie to an Offeror's FPRP (and which such reporting has historically been used and relied upon by DCAA), rather than requiring the development and use of a manual Excel model that would be both less efficient and allow for more potential for human error?<br><br>R31: The Offer shall utilize the spread sheets provided by the government. <br><br>Q32: Will the workbook referred to as "Attachment 4-workbook" be required to be used for the Offeror's submission to the government, and if so, will it be provided to potential Offerors prior to the release of the RFP in order for the prospective Offerors to prepare to best administer their proposal efforts towards completion of the workbook in the format of such workbook?<br><br>R32: The workbook will be released with the final RFP.<br><br>Q33: Request clarification on the organization of the Past Performance volume.  Does each contract submitted for past performance contain a Section 1 & 2 (meaning Section 1 & 2 repeat for each past performance contract), or is there only one Section 1 and one Section 2 that respectively contain Contract Description and Performance information for all relevant contracts?<br><br>R33: Each contract shall have its own section 1&2<br><br>Q34: Ref Section Draft L.2.c(ii)(c) - A "major subcontractor" is one that performs "more than 20% of the total proposed price".  Please confirm the "total proposed price" is the summation of the proposed prices for each Sample Task, not the total evaluated price or contract value.  <br><br>R34: Total proposed price will be utilized.<br><br>Q35: Ref Section Draft L.2.c(ii)(c) - Is the outline of work assignments (provided in Section 3) limited to subcontractors that perform more than 20% of the total proposed price, or does it include all proposed subcontractors?  Are the work assignments limited to the Sample Tasks or do they cover the entire contract PWS scope?<br><br>R35: The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q36: Please confirm that all proposed subcontractors performing less than 20% of the total proposed price are not required to submit past performance, or questionnaires.<br><br>R36: That is correct<br><br>Q37: Draft Section L.2.c(ii)(e) states that Performance Risk Assessment Questionnaires are to be completed (Parts I and II) and returned to the Offeror for inclusion in their proposal.  However, Part III in the Questionnaire requires the completed document be returned to the Contracting Officer in the cover letter.  Please clarify how completed questionnaires will be submitted to the GTACS source selection team.  Typically, completed questionnaires are not returned to the Offeror.  <br><br>R37: The questionnaires will be returned to the Contracting Officer or specialist as will be stated in the final RFP.<br> <br>Q38: Please clarify the correct title of Volume II - is it Past Performance Risk, Past Performance (Factor) or Past Performance?  <br><br>R38: Past Performance<br><br>Q39: In reference to Draft Section L & M, Page 4 - (ii) Volume II - Past Performance (Factor), we view a discrepancy between the definition of "relevancy" and the page limit of 50 pages.  Will the Government please clarify that the Offeror will be allowed to determine which of its contracts and which of its Major Subcontractor's contracts are relevant to this effort in light of a limited page count?<br><br>R39: Please refer to R28.<br><br>Q40: In reference to Draft Section L & M, Page 13 - Cost Price (Factor) iv. Subcontracts/Interdivisional Effort - A listing of individual Subcontract/ Interdivisional Efforts (S/IE) identifying the company and its specific division or segment with its corresponding cost by Contractor Fiscal Year. Note: The prime contractor must have available the cost/price analysis for all costs over the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) threshold, currently all sub/interdivisional costs $700K and over.  In addition, current FAR guidance requires all sub/interdivisional work $700K and over to be certified cost or pricing data, will the Government please clarify which FAR Clause(s) are applicable here?  Will the Government please clarify if this reference includes commercial suppliers? <br><br>We view a discrepancy between the nature of the GTACS competition and FAR 15.403-1 Prohibition on obtaining certified cost or pricing, which describes an exemption for providing cost and pricing data for COTS suppliers in occasions of adequate price competition.  Will the Government please clarify its intent?<br>FAR 15.403-1 Prohibition on obtaining certified cost or pricing requires that the Prime Contractor provide Certified Pricing in order to flow that requirement down to Subcontractors.  Section L and M do not require the Prime to submit certified pricing.  Will the Government please clarify this request? <br><br>R40: For purposes of the evaluation of the source selection, no certified cost or pricing data will be required as part of an offeror's submission, however, the Government reserves the right to request 'other than cost and pricing data' if required at either the evaluation of sample tasks or during evaluation of future DO/TOs.<br><br>Q41: In Draft Section L & M, Page 19 - c. Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Performance Risk - Will the Government please provide referenced Section IV?<br><br>R41: This reference has been deleted from the final RFP.   <br><br>Q42: In Draft Section L & M, Page 17 - PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION APPROACH <br>"A major subcontractor is defined as one who will be providing hardware, software or services those subcontract is for more than 20% of the total proposed price."  If the Sample Task Order requires more that 20% of a vendor's COTS hardware, will that vendor then qualify as a "major subcontractor" and will the Government require Past Performance from that vendor in the Past Performance volume?  Or will the Offeror be able to treat said vendor as a commercial component supplier?  <br><br>R42: The vendor is considered a major subcontractor and will be required to provide Past Performance data.<br><br>Q43: Will the Government require certified pricing from that vendor if the total dollar amount is over $700K?  <br><br>R43: Please refer to R40.<br><br>Q44: Draft L.2b, "File Packaging"; p3<br>Question/Comment:  <br>There appears to be a disconnect between the Sample Task response format preparation instruction in Draft Section L and the Task Execution Plan (TEP) contents defined in the Draft PWS in paragraph 3.14.3 (and its two sub-paragraphs 3.14.3.1, 3.14.3.2, and 3.14.3).  Please clarify.<br><br>R44: For the RFP follow the instructions in Sections L&M.  For future DOs/TOs follow the instructions as outlined in the PWS.    <br><br>Q45: Draft L.2c (iv), VOLUME III - SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION PLAN (FACTOR); p7<br>Question/Comment:  <br>Will the Government recognize and give credit to a Prime's subcontracting to its SDB Partners who are not 8(a) Business Development Program participants as expressed in its Small Business Subcontracting Participation Plan?	<br>Rationale: Restricting small business participation credit to 8a Business Development Program small businesses ignores the larger community of Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB).   The current wording implies the SDB category at the top level are not counted.<br><br>R45: Yes, the Government will recognize and gave credit to a Prime's subcontracting to its SDB partners who are not 8(a) Business Development Program participants.  <br><br>Q46: Draft L.2c, "Content Requirements"; p3<br>Question/Comment:	<br>Please state if the "Summary Section" of the proposal files is the same as the summaries defined under 3.14.3 in the draft PWS released in January, 2011.  <br>Rationale: This will help us understand more fully what information is requested by the Government by this part of Section L.<br><br>R46:   Please refer to R21.<br>  <br>Q47: Draft L.2c(ii)(c), "Section 3 - Subcontracts"; page 6<br>Question/Comment:<br>Within the Section L Past Performance volume and the Section M Past Performance Evaluation, we recommend that the government clarify the definition of Major Subcontractor (>20%) to be based upon the price of each Sample Task taken alone, as opposed to the sum of the three (3) Sample Tasks price taken together.  We want to avoid a situation that is too restrictive.  For example, a subcontractor performing >20% of effort on Sample Task #1 may not be >20% of the total price for three Sample Tasks combined.  <br>Rationale:<br>With three disparate sample tasks, it is possible that individual Major Subcontractors would not have a high level of proficiency for all three task areas.  If bound to (>20%) for a given Major Subcontractor as a sum of the three Sample Tasks, the Prime Contractor would be limited on the number of Major Subcontractors included in the Sample Task responses, which would limit who the prime contractor can use for Past Performance citations.  If prime contractors have to weigh the value of a subcontractor's past performance against the best technical solution for each sample task, the unintended consequence to the Government could result in responses that do not deliver the Best Value solution that is desired.<br><br>R47:  The Government Contracting Officer will take this recommendation under consideration. <br><br>Q48:  Draft L.2c (iv)(b), "Table entry row F"; p9<br>Question/Comment:<br>The emphasis on HBCU/MI subcontracting in Section L seems disconnected from the intent of the small business goals under the GTACS PWS/RFP.<br>Rationale:<br>College/University participation typically involves basic science research and technology development. The GTACS three task areas of system Development, Production & Deployment and Sustainment typically do not require College/University participation.   <br><br>R48: The Contracting Officer will take this under consideration. <br><br>Q49: Question/Comment:<br>The ability of an Offeror's team (total composition) to adequately cover the breadth of tasking in the PWS does not appear to be a consideration.  Section M as currently written only evaluates the team composition on the Sample Tasks.  While the final team composition may have no direct bearing on the sample tasks, an Offeror needs to be responsive to the PWS elements.  It is suggested that a team assessment matrix similar to that below be considered as part of the offering.<br>Rationale:<br>The GTACS PWS paragraph 1.0 "Scope" emphasizes the requirement for the Prime and his Team to address all Hardware, Systems and Services aspects defined in PWS paragraphs 4.1 through 4.5.   <br><br>Table x.  PWS Capability Matrix<br>PWS Category - GTACS Prime - GTACS Partners<br><br>R49: The Contracting Officer will take this under consideration.<br><br>Q50: Draft L.2c (iv)(b), "Small Business Participation Goals"; p7-9<br>Question/Comment:<br>On page 7 in 3rd paragraph under (b), the letter designations used in the narrative do not match the letter designations in the table. 	<br>Rationale:<br>Questions in the final RFP will be reduced if this minor clerical error is rectified. <br><br>R50: In the final RFP, the matrix will be deleted, and will be replaced with clear instructions on the Small Business Participation Plan.<br><br> Q51: Draft L.2c(iv)(d), "HBCU/MI Target Participation"; p11<br>Question/Comment:<br>NAICS Codes are only requested for HBCU/MI subcontractors and not the rest of the small business sub-categories.   NAICS Codes for all Team Partners should be of interest to the Government so that the proposal evaluators know that a Prime Offeror is working with small businesses with GTACS relevant NAICS Codes to perform work under this contract.<br><br>R51: In the final RFP, participation breakout by NAICS will be required for all Small Business Sub-Categories.<br><br>Q52: Draft L.2c(iii), VOLUME IV - COST-PRICE (FACTOR); p3, 12 & 14<br>Question/Comment:<br>Similar RFPs in the past have included a template for a cost file that had a defined template.  Will the government define a template for bidders to complete for the cost volume?  <br>Should there also be a filename entitled "Cost.xlsx" or even a series of filenames ending in .xlsx for the three separate cost spreadsheets referenced as (a), (b), and (c) above?<br>Rationale:<br>In iii VOLUME IV - COST-PRICE (FACTOR) in subparagraphs (a), (b), and (d), it is required to be submitted in Microsoft 2007 Excel files in the proposal.  However, in Proposal Files in Table 1 for the Volume IV Price, it states the file name is to be Cost.doc.<br><br> R52: A template will be provided.<br><br>Q53: Question/Comment:<br>A review of the suggested proposal volumes does not appear to adequately consider or evaluate an Offeror's ability to manage a diverse team and effectively deliver solutions on the Task Orders.  A  "Management" volume or section would allow discussion of Program Management activities, contract management, execution management and overall subcontract management and  provide the Government with additional insight and will reduce contract risk by eliminating "surprises"- i.e., execution impacts in cost and schedule that are otherwise unforeseen or unreported until they become issues.<br>Rationale:<br>Management of the contract and individual task orders including schedule and cost status are important aspects to consider when choosing a contractor.<br><br>R53: The contracting officer will take this under consideration.<br><br>Q54:  Draft L.2c(i)," Content Requirements, Tech Volume"; p3,4	<br>Question/Comment:<br>Draft Sections L&M do not appear to give relevance to, or generally track with, the Draft PWS.  In one example, the TEP Summaries under 3.14.3 of the Draft PWS suggest that bidders include price but the Draft L&M state that Vol I shall not include any price data.  Please clarify. <br><br>R54:  The exclusion of price/cost information from other parts of the Offeror's proposal is to maintain the integrity of the technical evaluation. Subsequent to the initial contract award, the TEPs will follow the general preparation instructions set forth in the PWS with detailed information contained in each RTEP.  Please refer to R44.  <br><br>Q55:  Draft L.2c(iv), "VOLUME III - SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION PLAN (FACTOR)";  p7<br>Question/Comment:<br>The current descriptions and evaluation criteria only appear to give consideration to the Small Business partners identified and incorporated into the Sample Task responses (non-awarded).  It is suggested that insight into an Offer's team composition would benefit the Government by demonstrating the Offer's commitment to small businesses on their GTACS Team who are not participating in any of the three (3) Sample Tasks.<br>Rationale:<br>Full team composition for executing an IDIQ contract can be an important factor in determining who can offer the best solutions.<br><br>R55:  Small Business Participation Plan (SBPP) will be evaluated separately from sample tasks.  SBPP must address team composition and the team make up to ensure full understanding of the total scope of the effort, to including enforceable commitment.  <br><br>Q56:  Draft L. (iv) VOLUME III - SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION PLAN (FACTOR); p11 and SECTION M - EVALUATION FACTORS; C. EVALUATION APPROACH; 4.  SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION PLAN EVALUATION APPROACH.  P19<br>Question/Comment:<br>We request the government eliminate the term "enforceable commitment" and eliminate the additional weighting given to "enforceable commitment".  <br>Rationale:<br>As previously stated by the Government, each delivery order will be unique in nature.  As such, there is no way to know what requirements will be on future GTACS Task or Delivery Orders. Therefore, it is not possible to "commit" specific work share or scope to any sub-contractor.  If this was done, the prime contractor would be forced to propose Task or Delivery Order responses that might not provide the government with the best technical solution or the best value solution.  This also restricts fair competition within the prime contractor team.  The decision of which combination of small businesses will provide the best value solution to the government should be made based on the unique requirements of each Task or Delivery Order.<br><br>R56: The Government does not intend to eliminate the term "enforceable commitment, Enforceable commitment serves as a mean to ensure Small Business participation and as a deterrent from switching Small Business team members without the approval of the Contracting Officer and the Chief Associate Director of CECOM Small Business.<br><br>Q57: Please confirm that a winning prime will not be allowed to bring on additional sub-contractors following an award.<br><br>R57: The winning Prime will be allowed to bring additional Subcontractors on following the award. "The request for the replacement of a sub-contractor after contract award shall be formally made to the contracting officer in writing - along with accompanying rationale for replacement. <br><br>Q58: Will the Government accept MS Word 2007 (.docx) files?<br><br>R58: Yes<br><br>Q59: Please confirm that the pages required for the table of contents and summary section are excluded from the page limits provided for Volumes I and II.<br><br>R59: Table of contents is excluded however the Executive Summary section is included as part of the overall page count.<br><br>Q60:  Does the forty-five lines per page limitation apply to tables, for which the Government allows a reduced font size?<br><br>R60: Yes<br><br>Q61: Please confirm, for sections that are under the page limit but contain pages over 45 lines, that the sum of any additional lines will be moved to the back of the document and only removed if the document is then over the page limit.<br><br>R61: The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q62: Page 6 Draft Sec L.

The information provided for the prime Offeror and each proposed major subcontractor must include the entire company name, company address, CAGE Code, DUNS Number and type of work to be performed by citing the applicable Government PWS paragraph number.  This includes all subcontractors who will be providing hardware or services whose subcontract is for more than 20% of the total proposed price.<br>Comment: This requirement is written in the future tense.<br>Please confirm this requirement belongs in the past performance section.<br><br>R62: Confirmed<br><br>Q63: If this requirement does belong in the past performance section, can the Government confirm they will correct the tense so it properly addresses work already completed or ongoing?<br><br>R63: Yes<br><br>Q64: Please define the term "enforceable commitment."<br><br>R64:  The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.  <br><br>Q65: Can the Government confirm that it expects a lack of competition on subsequent DO/TOs that will require certified cost or pricing data?<br><br>R65: The Government expects continued competition throughout the ordering period of this contract.<br><br>Q66: Will the system(s)/equipment within each of the three sample task areas will be the same or uniquely different?<br><br>R66: The Government does not intend to release details of the Sample Tasks prior to the final RFP.<br><br><br>Q67: This GTACS posting dated today, 5 April 2011, lists a response date of 5 May 2011.

Is it still the government's intention to release a full DRFP?<br><br>R74: Please refer to R72.<br> <br>Q75: Ref:   iv. Subcontracts/Interdivisional Effort -a listing of individual Subcontract/ Interdivisional Efforts (S/IE) identifying the company and its specific division or segment with its corresponding cost by Contractor Fiscal Year. Note: The prime contractor must have available the cost/price analysis for all costs over the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) threshold, currently all sub/interdivisional costs $700K and over.  In addition, current FAR guidance requires all sub/interdivisional work $700K and over to be certified cost or pricing data. <br><br>Question :  Current Draft Sections L and M do not appear to require the proposed prime to certify to cost or pricing data as this is a competitive procurement and 15.403-1(b)(4) would apply.  However, the language above appears to require subcontractors above $700,000 to provide certified cost or pricing data.  This appears to be an inconsistency.  Please clarify the Government's intent. <br><br>R75: Please refer to R40.  The following sentence will not be included in the final RFP, "In addition, current FAR guidance requires all sub/interdivisional work $700K and over to be certified cost or pricing data."<br><br>Q76:  If the Subcontracts/Interdivisional Effort above should stand, please also consider the following:  The time required to obtain certified cost and pricing data will probably exceed the 30 day response time frame.  Pursuits that require the Offeror to obtain certified cost and pricing data often make that data due to the Government after proposal submission but before contract award to allow sufficient time for the effort involved.    Will the Government please consider revising the scope of this requirement or providing additional time for submission of this data?<br><br>R76: Please refer to R40.  This information will be reflected in the final RFP.<br><br>Q77:  Draft PWS Draft PWS Reference:  N/A<br><br>Question:  Will the government provide a Draft RFP prior to the release of the final RFP?<br><br>R77: See response to Q72<br><br>Q78:  Draft PWS Draft PWS Reference:  N/A<br><br>Question:  According to Federal Business Opportunities Page (FEDBIZOPS) the GTACS RFP is anticipated to be released 2QCY11.  Since we are half-way through the second quarter of this calendar year, does the Government anticipate the RFP release to be pushed into the third quarter of 2011?  If not will the RFP be issued in June?<br><br>R78:  See response to Q72<br><br>Q79:  The Draft Section L and M for the Global Tactical Advanced Communications Systems (GTACS) and Services Solicitation has been reviewed and we would like to request clarification on the following:  Since the contracting officer will take under consideration "...broaden the contract to allow TS-SCI efforts to be competed under the contract." (Q30 on 5/12/2011), will the Gov also consider receiving a classified submission as it relates to TS-SCI past Performance? <br><br>R79: The contracting office will take this under consideration<br><br>Q80:  The Gov response to Q/C's received as of 16 February 2011 responded to Q/C Q34, with A34 "Construction will not be part of this contract and all references will be removed from the PWS."  Recent response to industry for Q/C received as of 06 May 2011, Q27 Will IDIQ contract holders have the opportunity to make site visits prior to RTEP release, especially for efforts requiring construction?  The Gov response was A27. "Depending on the requirements for individual DO/TOs issued under the GTACS contract, the Offeror will have the ability to make site visits".  Does this mean construction will be part of the contract; therefore all references will not be removed from the PWS, as previously stated?<br><br>R80: Each delivery order will specify the requirements at the time of award.  There will be no Military construction under this contract however there may be a requirement to provide temporary facilities to support specific requirements. <br><br>Q81:  Comment: The Small Business Participation Plan requirement does not appear to be related to a multiple award contract with DO\TOs to follow but more akin to single award contracts and DO\TOs.<br>Recommendation: Consider reviewing as an example Sections L (Small Business Utilization) and M (Small Business Utilization Factor Evaluation Approach) related to of the DRFP for the Communications and Transmission Systems (CTS) solicitation.  Solicitation number W52P1J-11-R-0018. DRFP Can be found at http://www.afsc.army.mil/ac/aaisdus/Sow.aspx.<br>Section L&M for CTS is a good example for a Small Business Participation Plan for a multiple award contract.<br><br>R81: The Contracting Officer will take this under consideration.<br><br>Q82:  There is no Management Volume.  Management risk is critical on this type of program. Suggest Government give offerors a 20 page volume to address organization structure, cost control, subcontractor management, hardware/software vendor management, EVM, reporting, Program Manager and key leads, production/manufacturing management processes, facilities, and ISO/CMMI status.  <br><br>R82: The Management information is contained in the Technical Volume.  <br><br>Q83: REF Page 3, Draft L.2.b May offerors provide a list of acronym definitions for each volume that is excluded from the page count limitations?<br><br>R83: Yes <br><br>Q84:  REF Page 3, Draft L.2.c Is there a page limit and any instructions for the "Summary Section" requested in each file per L.2.c? <br><br>R84:  Yes, Please refer to R21.  <br><br>Q85:  REF Page 4, Draft L.2.c (i) What is the page limit for the Technical Volume I Executive Summary?  Adequate space is required to provide an overview of the offeror's team structure, unique facilities, tools, and innovation that cannot be conveyed in 3 separate Sample Task responses.<br><br>R85:   Please refer to R21.<br>    <br>Q86:  Page 6, Draft L.2.c (ii)(c) Is the information in Paragraph (c) Section 3 - Subcontracts limited only to the prime contractor and major subcontractors whose subcontract is 20% more than the total proposed price?<br><br>R86: Total proposed price will be utilized<br><br>Q87:  REF Page 6, Draft L.2.c(ii)(c) Page 6, Para (c) - Subcontracts -This section states  "This includes all subcontractors who will be providing hardware or services whose subcontract is for more than 20% of the total proposed price."  Does this mean the total proposed price for the 3 Sample Tasks, OR for subcontractors that the prime envisions to have a minimum 20% participation across the life of the GTACS contract 5 year life?  The latter is recommended since key past performance should be tied to subcontractors' roles for total support; the Sample Tasks are not necessarily indicative of the prime contractor's overall team structure and subcontracting plan.  <br><br>R87: Please refer to R47. <br><br>Q88: REF Page 6, Draft L.2.c(ii)(e) Paragraph (e) requests that offerors fill out part I of the PRAG questionnaire, give it to their reference points of contact, and have the points of contact return surveys back to the offeror for submission with the proposal. The PRAG form contradicts this instruction and requests that points of contact e-mail the survey directly to the GTACS contracting officer. Please clarify. Note - we recommend that points of contact e-mail surveys directly to the GTACS contracting officer.<br><br>R88: Please refer to R37<br><br>Q89:  REF Page 6, Draft L.2.c(ii)(e) PRAG Questionnaire If, as requested in paragraph (e), offerors will indeed be required to submit completed PRAG surveys with their proposals, we request that they be excluded from the page count. The PRAG form is 3 pages in length, and the Government has requested that the Contracting Activity and the Technical Representative for each referenced effort fill out a questionnaire. This will take up other valuable pages that will be important for the Government's evaluation. Please remove the questionnaires from page count considerations (if they are to be submitted with proposals).<br><br>R89: Please refer to R22<br><br>Q90:  REF Page 6, Draft L.2.c (iv) Is VOLUME III - SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION PLAN, to be listed as (iii)?<br><br>R90: Yes<br><br>Q91:  REF Page 7, Draft L.2.c(iv)(b) Subcontracting Goals (Para b, page 7) - is this profile based on the TOTAL CONTRACT VALUE?  If so, the Government needs to provide an estimated value for the total contract value.  If the total value is based on the 3 Sample Tasks, the total program subcontracting goals will be impossible to realistically calculate and portray (also reference Draft Section M, page 19, Para 4(f).<br><br>R91: The answer to this question will be posted at a later date. <br><br>Q92: REF Page 11, L.2.c(iv)(3)(a) Paragraph (3)(a) requires the Small Business Participation Plan to have  "Base your percentages on TOTAL CONTRACT VALUE."  Are we to use the grand total of the 3 Sample Tasks as TOTAL CONTRACT VALUE; or use the Total Evaluated Price (TEP) after the multipliers are applied as indicated on page 18 - Draft Section M.C.3.b.<br><br>R92: Total evaluated price<br><br>Q93:  REF Page 11, Draft L.2.c(iii) Page 11 states "The Offeror shall provide Cost, Cost Plus, and Firm-Fixed Prices for its proposed notional systems/equipment in response to the three Sample Tasks provided with the RFP".  Please advise if it is correct to assume only one of the procurement types indicated will be required for each task; and if the Government will specify the type of pricing desired for each separate task order?  <br><br>R93:  Only one contract type will be utilized per sample task.<br><br>Q94: REF Page 13, Draft L.2.c (iii)(a)iv VOLUME IV - COST PRICE - Section (iii)(a)iv: Subcontracts/Interdivisional Effort:  Are we to include the interdivisional efforts as subcontracted dollars?]<br>	<br>R94: Yes, however, each prime shall propose IAW the Prime's disclosed practices.<br><br>Q95:  REF Page 16, Draft M.A  Paragraph M.A - Basis for Award, states, "Each RTEP will be competed amongst all Prime Contractors to the maximum extent practicable, and in accordance with the agreed upon Small Business Partial set-aside value of $3 Million threshold See section 4 below for additional detail." Section 4 provides no additional details of the $3 Million threshold. Please provide additional details.<br><br>R95: Section 4 reference will not be included in the final RFP.<br><br>Q96:  Para 3.14.12 - Small business - "All delivery/task orders below the $1 Million threshold that do not require development/ production/maintenance by an original equipment manufacturer or are otherwise restricted by proprietary requirements will be initially set-aside for small business awardees.  If after a three (3) day period two or more Small Business awardees indicate that they will not or cannot fulfill the requirement, it will then be solicited to all contract awardees regardless of size."  <br><br>Please clarify the Government's intent.  Are set-aside task orders only for efforts less than or equal to $1M, regardless of scope, i.e. the scope could address any aspect of the GTACS PWS?  Are all task orders valued over $1M, regardless of previous OEM involvement, to be solicited among all contract awardees?  <br><br>R96:  The partial set aside is $3M and could address any aspect of the GTACS PWS. Anything above that will be competed on a full and open competition.<br><br>Q97:  Does the Government intend to release a draft version of the full RFP, particularly Section L, Instructions and Section M, Evaluation Criteria?<br><br>R97:  See response to Q72<br><br>Q98: In accordance with the statement included in the posting of April 21, 2011 please clarify if the Government is requesting and accepting early submission of proposals and information at this time; and in advance of the issuance of the final solicitation and task orders.  <br><br>The statement included in this posting "This synopsis is provided for informational purposes and is not to be considered a request for proposal. However, all responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency when the final RFP is posted." implies the opportunity is available for the industry to submit proposals, capability statements, and information under this requirement which may be included and evaluated at the time of the final solicitation.  <br><br>Please advise if additional information is desired and requested at this time.<br><br>R98: No additional information is required<br><br>Q99:  In cases where a subcontractor on a GTACS Team is based out of Canada and has a subsidiary created for the purposes of conducting business with the U.S.  Government, where the subcontractor's rates and cost build-up formulas are typically audited by the Canadian Commercial Corp. (CCC) on behalf of the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD), will the requirement for submission of that subcontractor's proprietary cost information "sealed data" through an Army web site be waived, and normal CCC submission of the proprietary data be acceptable.  <br><br>R99: No, the requirements for submission, under DOD policy and United States Law, by a foreign subsidiary will not be waived. <br><br>Q100:  If a GTACS task order requires a contractor to perform design trade-offs, develop and test a prototype system solution (e.g. an Engineering Development Model, or EDM), will the Government provide that contractor a fair opportunity to bid the low rate/full rate production work should a requirement exist for that production work?    It is recommended that the development of final drawings, specifications, and models that would form the basis of another GTACS task order which is production and sustainment of the approved final configuration/design be performed by PEO C3T's SETA contractor, which would avoid an OCI for the original EDM developer, which is in the best interest of the Army, since GTACS teams are being formulated to address the total set of PWS requirements, and that production of that EDM / prototype would be a natural continuation of life cycle support for the procurement of those system (s).  Does the Government envision that this process could be streamlined by including all facets of the life cycle support in a single task order, particularly for ACAT programs?<br><br>R100: Yes <br><br>Q101:  Please advise if the Government is planning to provide responses to all the questions submitted to date under this effort.<br><br>R101: Yes<br><br><br>All interested parties should continue to watch the Federal Business Opportunities Page (FEDBIZOPS) under the Solicitation # W15P7T-11-R-C001 for further information.  <br><br>Contracting Office: <br>U.S. ARMY CONTRACTING COMMAND<br>ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND<br>6001Combat Drive, CCCE-CBC<br>Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD. 21005-1846<br><br>Point(s) of Contact:<br>Mr. David Hansen, Contract Specialist                  Phone: 443-861-4988<br>E-mail: david.e.hansen1@us.army.mil<br>Mr. Stephen Jenniss, Contract Specialist               Phone: 443-861-4989<br>E-mail: stephen.jenniss@us.army.mil<br>Ms. Barbara Hansen, Contracting Officer/Group Chief    Phone: 443-861-5061<br>E-mail: barbara.ann.hansen@us.army.mil<br>

During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307." </span></p>

<DESC>Questions and Answers<br />No information given on this document amends the solicitation.<br /><br />Question 1: Plans call for 6" wide asphalt trail under option. Secon (local asphalt supplier and paver says 6' width is all hand work. All asphalt equipment, paver, roller, etc is for 8" width.<br />Answer 1. See Answer 2.
<p>Question 2: 8' asphalt trail is much more cost effective. Can this be an option for the pricing on the asphalt trail? <br />Answer 2. An 8 ft. width is acceptable, however, item 941(10) Additional Aggregate Surfacing will need to be increased from 50 c.y. to 60 c.y. to blend the downhill edge of the paved trail.</p>
<p>Question 3: On the 190 ft of equipment access trails, do you want a specific width, and what type of material placement?<br />Answer 3. The equipment access trails adhere to the same specifications as the main trail except that grade is not limited to ADA/ABA standards, i.e. grades may exceed 5%.</p>
<p>Question 4: I note that under Materials: 941-03 Aggregate Surfacing (p. 10-26) asks to meet the AKDOT "Standard Specifications for Highway Construction, 1998" We have been using the AKDOT Stardard version updated in 2004. Table 703-1 and 703-2 for the surface aggregate. Can we use the aggregate spec listed in the FP-03, adopted by the USFS several years ago? Look at 704-1 table and 704-2 table, Page 613 of the FP-03. <br />Answer 4. FP-03 section 704 is for soils, not aggregates. Tables 704-1 and 704-2 are not sufficient for the job. The AKDOT spec aggregates are commercially available. Spec versions more current than 1998 are not significantly different regarding the E-1 gradation.</p>

<p>Research supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), strives to understand, treat, and ultimately prevent the myriad infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases that threaten millions of human lives. The NIAID Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) supports extramural research for the investigation, control and prevention of diseases caused by all infectious agents other than HIV. Support for basic and applied research to develop and evaluate therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics is provided through a variety of research grants and contracts. DMID also supports an array of research resources and services to assist investigators, including programs that provide or make available genomic data and technologies; organisms and state-of-the-art reagents; biocontainment facilities; and preclinical and clinical translational research services (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/research/resources/dmid).</p>
<p>The development and introduction of new vaccines and biologics against potential agents of bioterrorism, drug-resistant pathogens, emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, as well as infectious diseases prevalent in resource-limited countries remain a high public health priority. To assist in filling these public health gaps, the NIAID requires a coordinated evaluation and testing services program to provide preclinical, nonclinical, and clinical testing support for multiple vaccine and biologic candidates that emerge from academia, the private sector, or other sources. The suite of testing services will encompass those activities commonly associated with the testing of vaccine and biologic products for infectious disease required for Investigational New Drug (IND) application and/or Biologic License Application (BLA). Consequently, DMID recognizes that to obtain the full spectrum of expertise or facilities required to perform all activities set forth in this solicitation, individual organizations will likely need the expertise and resources of other organizations or persons through consortia agreements, partnerships, subcontracts, and/or consultants. The Contractor shall be responsible for ALL work performed and shall be responsible for project planning, initiation, implementation, management and communication; evaluation, selection, and management of subcontractors; and for all deliverables specified in this contract and each awarded Task Order.</p>
<p>DMID anticipates awarding a single Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract that provides a guaranteed minimum award to the organization or consortium that best meets the overall qualifications needed to fulfill the technical requirements of this solicitation. Sample Task Orders are provided in the RFP solely to evaluate offeror responses and capabilities. Task Orders for specific tasks will be issued after award of the Basic Contract.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives</p>
<p>The purpose of this solicitation is to establish a NIAID resource entitled "Evaluation and Testing Services (ETS) for Vaccines and Other Biologics for Infectious Diseases" that provides a suite of preclinical, nonclinical, and clinical testing services for vaccines and other biologic products. While the overall suite of testing services is comprehensive, the intent is to provide individual services on a case-by-case basis for a diverse collection of vaccine and biological product candidates, rather than carry a single product candidate through an entire preclinical development pathway. These services are intended to help a wide variety of investigators in a broad number of scientific areas obtain critical data needed to acquire additional funding, gain prospective partnerships (either for further development or to support Phase I/II/III trials), fulfill regulatory requirements, and complete studies needed to apply for an IND and enter Phase I/II/III trials.</p>

<CONTACT>Ellen T. Crain, Contract Specialist, Phone 618-229-9679, Email ellen.crain@disa.mil
<DESC><p>Request for Information (RFI) for<br />DISA Establishment of Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) Services</p>
<p>Contracting Office Address<br />Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), DITCO-Scott PL8311, P.O. 2300 East Drive, Bldg 3600, Scott AFB, IL 62225-5406</p>
<p>Description<br />THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR THE DISA ESTABLISHMENT OF A MOBIULE VIRTUAL NETWORK OPERATOR (MVNO) COVERING THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE TO SUPPORT EXTENDING ENTERPRISE UNIFIED COMMUNICATIONS TO MOBILE DEVICES.</p>
<p>1.0 Background<br />The government is seeking to extend enterprise unified communications (real-time presence, messaging, and voice) to mobile endpoint devices locked to an MVNO providing third and eventually fourth generation network service. This MVNO would offer data services only with encrypted Voice over IP (VoIP) services being provided by the enterprise using this link.</p>
<p>In addition to real-time media services, the Government acting as an MVNO seeks to actively manage and monitor the security of endpoint devices (smartphones, Wi-Fi bridges, tablets, etc) while minimizing the overall attack surface exposed to adversaries. The Government sees this as a niche telecom business ultimately servicing Federal, State, Local, and Tribal agencies. The RFI is issued as a means of technical discovery and information gathering. We seek to (1) validate that the Government's Mobility program as described above constitutes a valid telecom niche and (2) characterize the steps, resources, and lead time required to establish a MVNO that leverages the host Mobile Network Operator (MNO) to obtain global reach. DISA is seeking this information from industry, particularly MNOs and Mobile Virtual Network Enablers (MVNE).</p>
<p>2.0 Request for General Information<br />1. Describe your organization (MNO, MVNO, MVNE, etc). Do you manage your own network operations?<br />2. How many MVNO launches has your organization directly participated in?<br />3. Describe your experience with and expertise in developing MNVO business models.<br />4. Describe your experience with and expertise in developing MVNO technical architectures and implementation plans. What is the largest MVNO you have been involved with?<br />5. Describe your experience with and expertise in developing procedures and mechanisms for provisioning and managing MVNO subscriber equipment.<br />6. How well has the Government identified a legitimate market niche that can be addressed by a MVNO as described in Section 1? How would the business model work to achieve this goal?<br />7. Describe your experience in implementing security and device management for MVNOs noting any experience with Open Mobile Alliance standards</p>
<p>3.0 General Technical Requirements<br />Ideally the MVNO should be capable of supporting the following operational requirements.<br />&bull; Support for 1 million or more subscribers<br />&bull; Segregation and isolation of MVNO subscribers from the PSTN and the global internet<br />&bull; Restrict service offering to particular handset devices (locking)<br />&bull; Centralized provisioning of endpoint devices including SIM cards (if applicable), device programming, etc.<br />o Generation and storage of all cryptographic keys for over-the-air updates, etc.<br />&bull; Centralized security management of endpoint and infrastructure devices (eg. remote wipe of data-at-rest encryption keys, policy enforcement, device integrity, etc.) including ability to accept, deny, remediate, or block devices from communicating with the MVNO.<br />&bull; Centralized management and deployment of device firmware and operating system updates.<br />&bull; Dedicated or otherwise engineered backhaul connectivity to Government data centers hosting enterprise unified communications services.<br />o Mobile endpoint to enterprise connectivity via an always-on IPsec VPN connection with no split tunneling carrying<br />&#61607; Secured Unified Communications Signaling (eg. SIP) over TLS<br />&#61607; Secured Unified Communications Media (eg. G.729 voice) over DTLS-SRTP<br />&bull; Enforceable Quality of Service measurements for ensuring packetized voice quality<br />&bull; Deployment of MVNO picocells or femtocells in isolated and low-coverage areas<br />&bull; Robust subscriber management and billing capabilities<br />&bull; Detailed reporting on the physical location (Lat, Long. plane only) of MVNO subscribers</p>
<p>3.1 Request for Technical Information<br />1. How would you architecturally isolate MVNO subscribers from the PSTN and the Internet when users are roaming on another network?<br />What interfaces, if any, would be exposed to the PSTN or the internet?<br />2. How would you ensure that backhaul to Government datacenters is segregated and protected?<br />3. Is it possible for MVNOs to administer Access Point Names (APN) to differentiate user communities among the subscriber base?<br />4. How would you restrict MVNO services to a particular list of endpoint devices?<br />5. How would you identify and/or remove non-approved devices operating on the MVNO?<br />6. Is it possible for the MVNO to fully control what updates get applied to devices? Applications? Is this device or OS dependant?<br />7. How would an MVNO manage services like key management for data-at-rest or "full device" encryption?<br />8. Describe the provisioning process for MVNO subscribers and subscriber equipment. Attention should be given to the division of labor between the MVNO, back-end enterprise, and the host MNO. How flexible is this division of labor?<br />9. How can quality of service be enforced for packetized voice? Address both MVNO and roaming connections.<br />10. How would the MNVO deploy picocells or femtocells to isolated and/or low coverage (eg. office buildings) areas?<br />11. Can you provide a notional architecture diagram showing the key hardware components and an overlay to that diagram showing functional roles provided by the hardware?<br />12. Have you integrated any mobile-handset anti-virus or network access control products within an MVNO before? Are there products in this space yet?<br />13. Given an MVNO of some 1 million users, can you provide a rough (order of magnitude) estimate for monthly network bandwidth required to support VoIP and data (email, messaging, web access)?<br />14. To what level of detail would you be able to provide information on the apparent physical locations of MVNO subscribers as they access the network? Address both MVNO and roaming connections.<br />15. Are you able to provide MVNO subscriber location information in near-real time? If not, with what delay?</p>
<p>4.0 Request for Business and Logistical Information<br />This section assumes a notional MVNO with the number of subscribers exceeding 1 million.</p>
<p>1. Describe the steps and timeframe for establishing the MVNO.<br />2. Describe the business relationships required to enable domestic and international roaming.<br />3. Estimate the non-recurring start-up costs for the MVNO.<br />4. Describe the supply chain and business relationships required for the MVNO to offer particular endpoint devices (eg. Smartphone, WiFi bridges, and tablet computing devices).<br />5. Describe the work-flow and estimate cost associated with stocking, provisioning, and equipping an MVNO subscriber with a particular device.<br />6. Estimate the typical monthly recurring airtime (data only) costs assuming we are extending enterprise unified communication services (VoIP, e-mail, messaging, web access) to MVNO subscribers.<br />7. Describe the processes surrounding billing assuming both the "unlimited" and pay-go models.<br />8. Estimate the number of full-time equivalents required to operate the MVNO.</p>
<p>5.0 MVNO Support on Long Term Evolution (LTE) Networks<br />1. Will an LTE network be capable of hosting a MVNO? Please provide a timeline for your roll out of LTE capabilities to your network if applicable.<br />2. Provide an architecture diagram that shows the changes required to migrate a 3G MVNO to an integrated LTE capability. Please include the Radio Access Network (RAN) and evolved packet core (EPC) network elements by vendor and model wherever possible.<br />3. Do you have plans to (or how would you) upgrade or migrate to new systems in the EPC to support advanced subscriber data management functions? What vendors have you considered for these systems? <br />4. When do you anticipate circuit switched voice services will be removed from your LTE network?<br />5. Have you or do you intend to implement packet switched voice service using an IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS)? Do you see IMS as an important component in a MNO business strategy? What applications are you planning to provide through IMS? How would an MVNO incorporate IMS?<br />6. What are your plans for implementing additional security in a core network? Do you see the need to deploy IPSec for network domain security?<br />7. Do you have any security concerns about the increased use of femtocells and home e-nodeB s in LTE?</p>

Ring Power is the factory authorized distributor for Caterpillar for the entire five state region of the, (Zone 1) for the Southeast United States.  The subject equipment is newly installed and currently under warranty with Ring Power and the warranty would be void if service to is provided by an unauthorized Caterpillar Zone 1 agent.  Also, there is proprietary software in the computer controls of the generator system and any attempt at repairs would have to include access to that information via computer.

The entire building, including the generator systems, is under warranty. The warranty for the generators is from Caterpillar, through the local dealer, Ring Power. The warranty states that all maintenance must be performed on the system to manufacturer's recommendations. The warranty also specifies that the maintenance must be performed by an authorized Caterpillar dealer and would be void if service is provided by an unauthorized agent.  Ring Power is the only authorized dealer for the local area, (Zone 1). The generators are all microprocessor controlled, in that the entire control panel is computerized.  In order to operate and maintain the generators and engines, only authorized technicians can access information on the unit, alarm settings, engine parameters, etc. This requires specific software to be installed on the computers that are connected to the generators. This software is proprietary, and only authorized Caterpillar dealers and their employees have access to it.  See attached memo from the manufacturer, Caterpillar.

<DESC> Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the  Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority

Ring Power is the factory authorized distributor for Caterpillar for the entire five state region of the, (Zone 1) for the Southeast United States.  The subject equipment is newly installed and currently under warranty with Ring Power and the warranty would be void if service to is provided by an unauthorized Caterpillar Zone 1 agent.  Also, there is proprietary software in the computer controls of the generator system and any attempt at repairs would have to include access to that information via computer.

The entire building, including the generator systems, is under warranty. The warranty for the generators is from Caterpillar, through the local dealer, Ring Power. The warranty states that all maintenance must be performed on the system to manufacturer's recommendations. The warranty also specifies that the maintenance must be performed by an authorized Caterpillar dealer and would be void if service is provided by an unauthorized agent.  Ring Power is the only authorized dealer for the local area, (Zone 1). The generators are all microprocessor controlled, in that the entire control panel is computerized.  In order to operate and maintain the generators and engines, only authorized technicians can access information on the unit, alarm settings, engine parameters, etc. This requires specific software to be installed on the computers that are connected to the generators. This software is proprietary, and only authorized Caterpillar dealers and their employees have access to it.  See attached memo from the manufacturer, Caterpillar.

THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): SITE DEVELOPMENT INC. W911XK-C-0026, RED RUN CONSTRUCTION PROJECT 76281<br><br>DT001 Slope Repair Area Change<br>The design does not account for the transition from the existing to<br>the proposed top of bank.The transition from existing to proposed<br>top of bank will be tapered to provide a smooth transition into and<br>out of the slope repair areas as shown on sheet no. CG502-1. The<br>service access road shall be constructed/maintained no closer than 5<br>feet from the edge of the proposed top of bank as shown on sheet no.<br>CG502-2&3. Tree removal may be necessary to properly construct the<br>service access road.<br><br>DT006 Concrete, Debris and Duct Bank Issues<br>Item 1. Upon excavation, concrete was discovered between the 96" and 114"<br>pipes at the proposed location of Manhole SS11 in Area 5. Some<br>concrete shall be removed to allow for proper excavation down to the<br>required depth and to properly remove the 48" pipe that connects<br>into the 114" pipe. The remaining concrete will be used to help<br>support proposed Manhole SS11. The Contractor shall test the<br>concrete to ensure its structural integrity. If structurally sound,<br>the Contractor shall dowel into the concrete and pour the manhole<br>base around it.<br>Item 2. Miss Dig discovered an electrical duct bank that ran directly<br>through the proposed location of Manhole SD1 and SD2 in Area 1. In<br>order to avoid damaging or rerouting the duct bank the Contractor<br>chose to move the proposed location of Manhole SD1 and SD2 roughly 6<br>feet east. This location was the only option the Contractor had<br>within the right-of-way. While installing the earth retention system<br>the electrical duct bank shall remain supported at all times. The<br>Contractor shall hand dig around duct bank.<br>Item 3. The unmarked duct bank that was discovered during Miss Digs visit<br>forced the Contractor to relocate Manhole SD1 and SD2 at the<br>location of the 12 inch watermain. The watermain shall be rerouted<br>to avoid the new proposed location of Manhole SD1 and SD2.<br>Item 4. While excavating the Contractor encountered various debris slowing<br>the earth retention installation process down. The Contractor shall<br>provide all documentation of debris encountered along with impact<br>costs associated with the debris encountered in Option 7 areas.<br>DEBRIS DOES NOT INCLUDE SOIL ENCOUNTERED DURING EXCAVATION<br>
