DOCUMENT SECURITY
NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE BIDDERS/ OFFERORS

This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information.  SBU documents provided under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only.  In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per the solicitation.

REASONABLE CARE:

	1.  Limiting dissemination to authorized users.  Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it.  The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know.  Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA.  This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary to order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contracts, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.

NOTE:  It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records of recipients.

Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:

Valid identification for non-Government users.  Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information.  The identification shall be presented and verified to each dissemination.  Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and include item (d), as necessary:

a.	A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business.  The license, at a minimum, shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company.  The business must be of the type required to do the work.  A general contractors license may be substituted for the business license in states that issue such licenses.  In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitted; and

b.	Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification.  Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and

c.	A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary,

d.	A Valid picture state drivers license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents.  Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s) picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents.  SBA documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously, or at the time of pick up, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) through (c), above.

2.  Retaining and destroying documents.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter, as may be necessary.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding the hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using permanent erase utility or similar software.

	3.  Term of Effectiveness.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for what specific time thereafter, as may be necessary, as determined by the Government.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.

	4.  Written agreement of disposal.  For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractors record copy, at the time of Release of Claims, to obtain final payment.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding the hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CDs, deleting and removing material from computer hard drives using permanent erase utility or similar software.

The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.

I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command at Patuxent River, MD, intends to negotiate and award a firm fixed price contract for 470 new T58-GE-16/16A engine ignition exciters, P/N 10-377700-7, (GE P/N 4155T06P01) to Unison Industries, Jacksonville, FL.  The exciter is the spark plug for the motor.  The current exciter has created problems for the Fleet for years.  It breaks constantly and requires a great deal of maintenance, which the redesigned exciter will eliminate.  The new design will eliminate the need for approximately 120 removals per year, which will save the Government time and money.  The proposed order will be awarded on a sole source basis to Unison Industries.  Unison Industries is the designer and sole manufacturer of the T58 engine ignition exciter and retains exclusive proprietary rights to the technical data.  The authority permitting other than full and open competition is Title 10, U.S. Code 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The estimated delivery of the engine exciters is at a rate of 50 per month, beginning no later than 120 days after contract award.     
Numbered Note 22 applies.

DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<SOLNBR>5260
<RESPDATE>121206
<CONTACT>Phyliss Schlegel, 609-485-4380
<DESC>The market survey is hereby expanded to include Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB).  SDVOSBs possessing the requisite capabilities to accomplish the tasks in the SOW work are invited to respond by 2 p.m. local time on December 12, 2006 and shall provide all items requested in the original announcement, including a copy of a letter from the Small Business Administration certifying their status as an SDVOSB. The due date for submissions from SEDB/8(a) firms is unchanged, i.e. due by 2 p.m., local time, December 6, 2006. All submissions shall be delivered to: 	Federal Aviation Administration  	William J. Hughes Technical Center 	Engineering Services Acquisition Sub-Team (AJP-7551) 	Attn:  P. Schlegel 	Atlantic City International Airport, NJ 08405 Submissions shall be marked "AFTIL Market Survey Responses" and must include one (1) original and three (3) copies.   --------------End of Amendment-------------------------------------------- This public announcement is being issued in accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Acquisition Management System Section 3.2.2.4.  It is a survey, not a solicitation, to determine interest and capabilities of interested Small Economically Disadvantaged Businesses (SEDB).  A predecessor contract, #DTFA03-00-D-00022, Delivery Order 0002, was originally awarded to a SEDB firm.  The FAA has an ongoing need for some, but not all, of the tasks that were in this order.  This market survey is being conducted to aid the FAA in determining whether adequate competition exists to set aside competition to SEDBs.  Since this is a sources sought announcement, no evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the respondents. The North American Industry Code Standard for the work comtemplated is 541330, Engineering Services.  The size standard is $4.5 million. A draft Statement of Work for Airport Facilities Terminal Integration Laboratory (AFTIL) support services is attached.  The FAA has a need for these requirements for the next five years. Interested companies are required to provide: -A copy of a letter from the Small Business Administratin certifying their status as a SEDB/8(a) firm. -Completed Business Declaration Form, (attached) -A capability summary of not more than 8 pages that addresses corporate capabilities specific to accomplish this work and transition of existing contract in a seamless manner.  The summary should include information on how contractor personnel will be supplied, i.e., currently available as employees of the prime, subcontractor arrangements, etc. Submission of these items is requested by 2 p.m. local time on December 6, 2006.  The FAA is not liable for costs associated with the preparation and submittal of responses to this announcement.  Brochures alone will not be considered sufficient documentation for demonstration of capabilities.  Responses will not be returned.  This is not a request for competitive proposals and will not result in a contract award.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted.  This is a sources sought announcement so no solicitation exists; please do not request one.  If a solicitation is issued, it will be synopsized on the FAA's contract opportunities web page and it is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor this site for release.  If a determination to set this requirement aside for SEDBs is made, failure to respond to this announcement may result in exclusion of offeror from completition since the competition may be released to qualified, responding SEDBs. Inquiries relative to this announcement are to be submitted in writing only via e-mail to Phyliss.Schlegel @faa.gov.

DOCUMENT SECURITY
NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE BIDDERS/ OFFERORS

This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information.  SBU documents provided under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only.  In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per the solicitation.

REASONABLE CARE:

	1.  Limiting dissemination to authorized users.  Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it.  The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know.  Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA.  This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary to order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contracts, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.

NOTE:  It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records of recipients.

Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:

Valid identification for non-Government users.  Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information.  The identification shall be presented and verified to each dissemination.  Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and include item (d), as necessary:

a.	A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business.  The license, at a minimum, shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company.  The business must be of the type required to do the work.  A general contractors license may be substituted for the business license in states that issue such licenses.  In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitted; and

b.	Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification.  Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and

c.	A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary,

d.	A Valid picture state drivers license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents.  Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s) picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents.  SBA documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously, or at the time of pick up, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) through (c), above.

2.  Retaining and destroying documents.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter, as may be necessary.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding the hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using permanent erase utility or similar software.

	3.  Term of Effectiveness.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for what specific time thereafter, as may be necessary, as determined by the Government.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.

	4.  Written agreement of disposal.  For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractors record copy, at the time of Release of Claims, to obtain final payment.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding the hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CDs, deleting and removing material from computer hard drives using permanent erase utility or similar software.

The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.

I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

<SUBJECT>A -- Study Centers for the National Children's Study (NCS)
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-NICHD-SN-2007-07
<RESPDATE>111606
<ARCHDATE>12302007
<CONTACT>Elizabeth Osinski, Lead Contract Specialist, Phone 301-435-6947, Fax 301-402-3676, Email osinskie@mail.niddk.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is planning to award up to 15 contracts to organizations having the ability to serve as Study Centers for the National Children's Study (NCS), if additional funds are provided in the FY 2007 President's Budget.

Expanding the National Children's Study to include additional Study Centers will require and is contingent upon additional funds being made available for the Study.  The proposed President's Budget for FY 2007 does not currently include funds for the National Children's Study.  However, the House and Senate Appropriations Committees have signaled strong support for the NCS for 2007.  The House Committee has included bill language "directing NICHD to dedicate $69,000,000 from within funds provided to continue the National Children's Study, including funding all Vanguard Centers and any other activities that were planned for fiscal year 2007."  The Senate Committee supported "full and timely implementation of the Study" [NCS] and stated that it has included funds within the Office of the Director to continue the study.  If funds were to be provided in 2007, awards for additional Study Centers is contingent upon the solicitation, receipt, evaluation and negotiation of technically acceptable proposals.  It is currently estimated that technical and cost proposals would be submitted in March of 2007.   Therefore, because of this expression of strong support for the NCS, this special notice is posted to alert prospective offerors to the possibility of awards for additional NCS Study Centers.  The solicitation for additional Centers, Request for Proposals, (RFP) is being prepared and posting it can be anticipated in approximately 8 weeks. The RFP that will be issued on or about December 12, 2006, will contain language that states that "funds are not presently available for this procurement and that the Government's obligation to award contracts under this RFP is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made." Offerors are advised that any expenses incurred in the preparation of proposals, will not be reimbursed by the Government. A RFP due date of on or about March 15, 2007 can be anticipated.   However, no resultant contract awards for new Study Centers can or will be made unless the FY 2007 Federal budget includes sufficient funds for the National Children's Study. 

Background information on the NCS is available at www.nationalchildrensstudy.gov.  The NCS is a large, long-term longitudinal study of environmental influences on children's health and development.  This Study will explore a broad range of environmental factors, both helpful and harmful, that influence the health and development of children.  For this Study, environment is broadly defined to include biological, chemical, physical, social and behavioral influences on children.  The range of outcomes includes, for example, obesity, diabetes and physical development; injuries; asthma; pregnancy-related outcomes; and mental health issues.  Likewise, a wide range of environmental influences will be examined for their impact on children's health and development.   These include, but are not limited to air pollutants, drinking water contaminants, soil and dust contaminants, dietary nutrients, dietary contaminants, parental occupational exposures, infectious and allergic agents, genetics and social and behavioral characteristics.   The Study's goal is to better understand the role of how these factors, alone and in combination, affect or are associated with children's health, disease and development.   The NCS will include a sample of approximately 100,000 children born in the U.S.   Enrolled women and, when possible, their partners will be assessed for a wide range of exposures and personal characteristics early in pregnancy or upon pre-pregnancy enrollment.  Monitoring of the mother's exposures will continue throughout pregnancy to birth, and possibly beyond.  The child will then be followed for a wide range of health and developmental outcomes and NCS defined environmental exposures throughout childhood until at least 21 years of age.  

Information will be collected from participants in the Study who reside in one of the 105 locations (mostly counties selected as primary sampling units for the first stage of a multi-stage sampling process).   The Study locations are identified on the map and list of Study Locations at www.nationalchildrensstudy.gov/about/locations.   The information will be collected by Study Centers that perform the data collection activities in the locations or counties.   It is important to distinguish the Study Centers (organizations or institutions engaged in conducting the study) from the Locations (geographic areas, counties) where eligible participants reside. 

In the initial phase of this Study, data will be collected in seven geographic areas in the United States.  Data collection in each of these seven geographic locations is being conducted by a single Study Center, referred to as a Vanguard Center.  Thus, there are a total of seven Vanguard Centers. The Vanguard Centers will be engaged in completing and finalizing the core protocol and piloting the protocol prior to its full implementation. Contracts for the Vanguard Centers were awarded in the Fall of 2005.   

Additional contracts are needed to establish Study Centers to conduct the data collections in the remaining 98 Study Locations (from the original sample of 105 locations).  It is anticipated that a RFP to solicit proposals to establish additional Study Centers will be posted within the next 8 weeks.     It is anticipated that approximately 10 to 15 additional Study Centers which will cover 30 to 45 study locations will be awarded depending on available FY 2007 funds.  In addition to the requirements listed below, Study Locations, will be sought such that, in combination, births across the selected locations are representative of all U.S. births on a number of factors.  Future solicitations for additional Study Centers to cover the remaining locations are dependent upon availability of funds. 

Offerors competing for the 10 to 15 additional Study Centers must demonstrate the ability to conduct the Study in the locations that the offeror proposes.  Specifically, offerors must document in their technical proposal, the following:  

1.	Demonstrate a clear understanding of the complexity of this Study, including the use of a complex multi-level sampling strategies for selection of Study locations and neighborhoods within locations from which participants will be recruited; the longitudinal nature of the data collection; the need to collect, process, and ship environmental samples and biologic specimens from multiple sites; and the need to collect interview data from multiple participants including pregnant women, fathers, and other primary caregivers, and children;
2.	Demonstrate an ability to gain community support and input to optimize subject recruitment, retention, and dissemination of Study findings;

<SOLNBR>07SQ810055
<RESPDATE>120506
<ARCHDATE>11282007
<CONTACT>LISA HAYES PURCHASING AGENT 3034452606     lhayes@do.usbr.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Seismic Exchange, Inc. to provide Seismic Reflection Data consisting of data, media, field notes, and geometry files to determine earthquake hazards for dam safety investigations of East Canyon and Echo Dams. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) FAR Subpart 13.  The proposed action is for supplies/services for which the Government believes that there is only one responsible source and no other supplies/services will satisfy the agency's requirement.  The following Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition: 1. Description of the supplies or services: The Bureau of Reclamation has a requirement to acquire seismic reflection data to determine earthquake hazards for dam safety investigations of East Canyon and Echo Dams. 2. Identify the proposed contractor (with address) and describe why they are the only source capable of providing the supply/service:  Seismic Exchange, Inc., 11050 Capital Park Drive, Houston, Texas 77041.  Seismic Exchange, Inc. is the sole provider of proprietary Milestone Seismic seismic reflection lines 84-266-259, 84-266-262, and 85-120-185 from the East Canyon-Parley's Canyon syncline region. Only this data had sufficient signal to noise and geographic coverage of the local fault systems and crustal velocity required for investigations of earthquakes hazards near East Canyon and Echo Dam. 3.  Additional facts that support the sole source vendor: We've conducted an investigation of all seismic reflection data available for purchase in the area of interest using data brokers to preview the data and these are the only seismic reflection data that had sufficient signal to noise and geographic coverage of the East Canyon-Parley's Canyon syncline region required for investigations of earthquakes hazards near East Canyon and Echo Dam. 4.  Describe all market research that led to the decision that there is only one source:  First we contacted the State of Utah to obtain whatever public domain data were available. After reviewing the data from the State of Utah we determined we needed additional data with better geographic coverage in the areas of interest and better signal to noise to allow delineation of fault geometries beneath the East Canyon-Parley's Canyon syncline region. We've conducted an investigation of all seismic reflection data available for purchase in the area of interest using data brokers to preview the data and these are the only seismic reflection data that had sufficient signal to noise and geographic coverage of the East Canyon-Parley's Canyon syncline region, required for investigations of the earthquake faulting and associated ground motions near East Canyon and Echo Dams. The total cost per mile to purchase the Milestone Seismic data through Seismic Exchange, Inc. is approximately 1/10th the cost per mile to acquire new data of comparable quality. Acquisition of new data would also incur a mobilization charge for equipment and crew of at least $10,000 and probably more than $20,000 for the relatively remote field location relative to most crew locations. Consequently, it's most cost-effective to acquire the existing proprietary Milestone Seismic data from Seismic Exchange, Inc. Firms that believe they can provide the required supply described above are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer.  Those firms believing they can provide similar services must provide supporting evidence that they can furnish the services identified above in sufficient detail to demonstrate the respondent's ability to meet the stated requirements. This notice is not a request for competitive quotes.  The Government will consider all responses received within 10 days of the date of publication of this notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries will only be accepted by e-mail at lhayes@do.usbr.gov.  Responses should include the firm's Dun and Bradstreet number (DUNS). Firms should identify themselves as either small business, or other than small business, in accordance with the size standard for North America Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code 541360 which is $4.5 Million per year averaged over last 3 years.

<DESC>The Veterans Affairs  Austin Automation Center has a requirement to renew licensing software agreement for BrightMail, a SPAM-controlling software, for a period of one year.  The software is currently deployed throughout the VA Infrastructure to provide this control and renewal licensing is required on or before 12/1/2006.  BrightMail software is exclusively a Symantec product. BrightMail software is designed to control and mitigate the amount of SPAM email entering and leaving agency servers.  The estimated value of renewing the software licensing agreement was estimated at $328,000.00.   This action is to justify the use of a Brand Name Description as described in FAR 6.302-1(c), Application for Brand Name Description. Although BrightMail is exclusively a Symantec product, the license renewal can be purchased from a number of agent contractors at a variety of prices as reflected above in the previous paragraph.  This product will be solicited utilizing the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Scientific and Engineering Workstation Procurement (SEWP) contracting system as specified by VA directive. DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTING OFFICER.  FOR INFORMATION/QUESTIONS CONTACT:  MARK SHUMAKE @ (512) 326-6029

STATEMENT OF WORK 
Requisition 

Malabsorption of Anti-Tuberculosis Medications in Botswana ? Statement of Work
Division of Tuberculosis Elimination

I.	BACKGROUND

Recent epidemiologic investigations have raised concerns regarding the role of drug malabsorption in the development of resistance to and subsequent efficacy of anti-tuberculosis drugs in HIV-infected patients.   A previous case-control study in San Francisco suggests that HIV infection and gastrointestinal symptoms are independent risk factors for the emergence of drug-resistance, and thus may impact the efficacy of anti-tuberculosis therapies. Other examples of poor clinical outcomes following the completion of standard therapy have occurred in HIV-infected persons who have been compliant with therapy. In a population-based molecular epidemiology study in San Francisco, TB relapse cases were found to not be the result of exogenous re-infection, but from prior infection. In the case-control study, many of the HIV patients who developed adverse outcomes had gastrointestinal illnesses that may have resulted in malabsorption.
     
This investigation will examine the hypothesis that malabsorption of anti-tuberculosis medications, specifically isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide) is associated with adverse outcomes in persons with HIV and TB.  To investigate this hypothesis we will measure the prevalence of malabsorption of anti-tuberculosis drugs, as reflected in serum pharmacokinetic parameters, and determine if these parameters are associated with increased rates of TB treatment failure and relapse after the completion of therapy.  The specific aims of this evaluation are:

1.	To measure the prevalence of the malabsorption of isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide, as reflected in serum pharmacokinetics parameters measured using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), in patients with pulmonary TB in Gaborone, Botswana

2.	To delineate characteristics of patients who have malabsorption of anti-tuberculosis drugs, based on an analysis of historical, clinical, and laboratory data, and HIV serostatus.

3.	To determine the rate of and risk factors for TB treatment failure at the completion of conventional short-course therapy and the rate of TB relapse in the 18 months following the completion of conventional short-course therapy.

4.	To explore the relationship between adverse clinical outcomes, other risk factors (including the malabsorption of anti-tuberculosis drugs) and polymorphic human genes such as Class I and Class II HLA, the Vitamin D receptor, and tumor necrosis factor.

In light of the high mortality rates seen among HIV-infected TB patients in sub-Saharan Africa, the current extent of the TB/HIV epidemic worldwide, and the increasing identification of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB strains, we believe this study may provide critical information in establishing the role of malabsorption of anti-tuberculosis medications on clinical outcome.  As such, we are submitting this statement of work with the intention of completing laboratory analyses of the 742 existing, unprocessed, and de-identified serum specimens collected during the original study. A portion of these 742 specimens is being stored at the CASPIR facility In Lawrenceville, Georgia and the remaining portion of specimens is being stored at National Jewish Medical Center in Denver, Colorado. 


II. 	PURPOSE

To acquire the services of a vendor who has: 
(a) Prior experience in collaborating with the CDC on the investigation of malabsorption of anti-tuberculosis medications 
(b) Experience and expertise in analyzing serum specimens by HPLC methodology, for anti-tuberculosis medication levels and pharmokinetics 
(c) Established quality assurance in regards to laboratory processing techniques (d) Ability to analyze specimens, and report results of analyses, in a timely manner.

III. 	SCOPE OF WORK

The vendor will receive from the CASPIR facility in Lawrenceville, Georgia and National Jewish Medical and Research Center in Denver, Colorado, the 742 serum specimens, appropriately packaged and aliquot for analysis, and will perform HPLC analysis of each sample to determine the levels of isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide.
 

IV. 	TASKS

Activities from the date of award for a 2-month period:

The vendor will assist CDC with activities necessary for the determination of serum anti-tuberculosis medication levels by means of the following:

1)	Use of established, study-specific definitions for the determination of ?low? and ?very-low? levels of isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide.
2)	Provide HPLC analysis of all serum specimens to determine the levels of isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide.
3)	Report of serum drug levels, in the form of an electronic Excel file and as a written paper report, the results of these analyses to the CDC within 2 weeks after receipt of all specimens.
4)	Collaborate with colleagues from CDC in the incorporation and final analyses of these laboratory results into the overall study.

<DESC>The Veterans Affairs  Austin Automation Center is seeking quotes to renew a licensing software agreement to utilize BrightMail, a SPAM-controlling software for a period of one year.  The software is currently deployed throughout the VA Infrastructure to provide this control and renewal licensing is required on or before 12/1/2006.  BrightMail software is exclusively a Symantec product. BrightMail software is designed to control and mitigate the amount of SPAM email entering and leaving agency servers.  The estimated value of renewing the software licensing agreement was estimated at $328,000.00.   This action is to justify the use of a Brand Name Description as described in FAR 6.302-1(c), Application for Brand Name Description. Although BrightMail is exclusively a Symantec product, the license renewal can be purchased from a number of agent contractors at a variety of prices as reflected above in the previous paragraph.  This product will be solicited utilizing the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Scientific and Engineering Workstation Procurement (SEWP) contracting system as specified by VA directive.

a. Must have and operating frequency of 60Hz ? 18kHz so soloists and vocalists can hear a full audio spectrum while performing.
b. Must have frequency response of 65 Hz to 17 kHz ? 4 dB so soloists and vocalist can hear a full audio spectrum while performing.  Any specification less could result in mission failure.
c. Must have a phase response of 500 Hz to 16 kHz ? 35?.  This specification ensures a wide and constant coverage which is essential because stage dimensions are different at every venue.
d. Must have a dynamic range of >110 dB.  This specification must be met or exceeded because the powered monitor must be able to produce enough loudness for soloists and vocalists to hear themselves over the live band.
e. Must have a 12? cone driver with a nominal impedance 2? and power handling capability of 400W.  This specification is required so that full mid range and low range frequencies can be heard with enough power to be loud enough.
f. Must have a 3? compression driver with a nominal impedance of 16? and power handling capability of 100W.  This specification must be met to ensure smooth and clear high frequency and loudness.  The 3? driver is also required for intelligibility.
g. Must have a built-in two channel complimentary MOSFET output stage class AB bridged amplifier.  This type of amplifier is necessary for bi-amplification of the two speaker transducers to offer the clarity and coverage needed for soloists and vocalists.
h. Must have a load capacity of 2? for low channel and 16? for the high channel.
i. Must have automatic voltage selection with a continuous range from 90 ? 265 VAC.  This specification is required so the powered monitor may be used in world wide locations and in venues with sub-standard electrical sources.
j. Must have female XLR input with male XLR loop output.  This is required to match current equipment.  Without these connections, additional equipment would be required.
k. Must have a common mode RF filter at 425kHz and a differential mode RF filter at 142kHz.  This specification is required to reduce RD interference that is common in many of our performance venues.

<DESC>Description for Storage Arrays:

RFQ GSA-TFI-2007-006.  This is a notice that the Government intends to award a contract under commercial terms and conditions as allowed by FAR Part 13.5 and 12 respectively.  The intent is to purchase a quantity of seven of one specific make and model of Excel Meridian Data, Inc. of Carrollton Texas, Meridian SecurStor  subsystems, 24SATA-II FC to SATA-II with Dual RAID controller Disk Subsystem.  The Government has the right to determine its own needs.  The Government requires a system which meets its minimum configuration needs to work within its current highly technical accredited system and which components must additionally be Defence Cyber Crime Institute (DCCI) validated.  Validation insures each subsystem component is useful for forensic processes as is required by the American Society of Criminal Laboratory Directors (ASCLD) accreditation.  In this case validation is essential for client to maintain its ASCLD accreditation.  That is for purposes of this procurement any system which is not presently DCCI validated and ASCLD accredited cannot be considered as the delay while any possible validation and accreditation process may be undertaken by a currently not validated and accredited substitute would cause undue delay for the acquisition being described.  Otherwise the arrays chosen meet the Greater than 2TB-single disk requirement, operate at data read/write and transfer rates sufficient for our minimum needs, and requirements for dual independent connections to a minimum of two (2) separate concurrent systems, while vesting compatible with clients current computer infrastructure and otherwise unique accredited forensic environment.  
Other salient features considered are Snapshot Volume Shadow Copy (VSS) journaling file system.  Single volume share up to 64 TB capacity (single namespace).  Advanced real-time Storage Management reporting.  Distributed File System (DFS) and File Replication Services (FRS).  Scalable capacity: Up to 128 TB per NAS.  Anit-virus engine with auto updates and event notifications.  Emergency OS fail-over and built-in from-scratch recovery tool.  Local tape library or single-drive support (direct attached or SAN accessible).  Over the wire backup Agent support for all tier 1 backup software vendors.  Supplier must be proactive and supporting existing IT needs of government agencies.  The successful offerrors product will be of a firm who is already providing investigation storage solutions.  Microsoft Windows XP, 2000 and 2003 (Active Directory) certified is a must as are Unix/Linus NIS grouping and NFS compliant and  Apple Macintosh AFP compliance.  The anti-virus engine must be ICSA certified.  Headless design mode must be available for no keyboard, mouse or monitor operation.   Easy-to-use secure web interface is necessary for routine administration (via Ethernet).  No client access licenses is to be required and there should be no concurrent user connection limits.  This system will be a proven 3rd generation built-for-NAS kernel and core technology system.  On-site parts and warranty services and on-site installation services availability must be options.  Unlimited technical support services must be included in the offer with no per-incident charge basis.  Technical Evaluation will apply to each offer or capabilities statement on the basis of their technical merit based on offer complete descriptions of their systems technical details, quality of their other products for the same or similar purpose, and past performance.  Price is an evaluated factor but is significantly less important than technical sub-factors which listed are in their descending order of importance.  The Government intends issuing one contract under commercial terms and conditions as allowed by FAR part 13.5 and 12, against this combined synopsis and solicitation after evaluating offers found acceptable and to the best value offer.  Contact Phyllis D. Rose as the primary POC.  ONLY contact the alternate POC if the primary is not available on the day of your inquiry.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

    Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held- 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

The Government will review each proposal submitted in response to this solicitation and make award to the offeror who submits the best proposal for supplying personnel with the qualifications listed above.    The Government will consider price as a factor in the evaluation, but the contractor?s technical qualifications and capability to provide a number of Structural Workers/Lead Structural Workers are more important.    Past Performance information will also be considered.  The experience will be evaluated for its relevancy and should be recent.    Firms lacking a record of relevant past performance history, or for whom information on past performance is not available, shall receive a neutral evaluation.  Marine shipyard experience is required.  Proposals not meeting this requirement may be determined unacceptable.  The evaluated price will be obtained by multiplying the estimated number of hours times the relevant labor category for the base year and each option year.  The labor category totals for the base year and each option year will then be added together to achieve a final price for evaluation purposes.   Price evaluation will be performed by the Contracting Officer to determine the reasonableness of each proposed price and to determine the Offeror?s understanding of the work and ability to perform the contract.  The Government reserves the right to make an award without discussions.  This requirement will be awarded on an all or none basis.

The work schedule is part-time from 8:00 a.m., to 4:45 p.m., Monday through Friday. STATEMENT OF WORK: Contractor will accept and coordinate Medical Staff requests for performance of Laboratory testing services normally provided at WRSU.

Specific Laboratory duties include patient reception, phlebotomy and performance of urinalysis, hematology, coagulation, chemistry, bacteriology and serfology testing, to include utilization of any automation and all quality control requirements required by accreditation standards. Performance of Laboratory testing must meet accreditation standards. Requires skills in use of RPMS software/Laboratory Package. KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE REQUIRED: Through understanding and knowledge of the principles, theories, techniques and practices appropriate to medical technology such as can be gained through completion of education and training equivalent to the requirements for a bachelor's degree in medical technology in a recognized college or university. The practical application of these principles, theories and accepted procedures characteristic of the profession to clinical laboratory work.

Skills in basic operation of computers, either freestanding or attached to clinical laboratory equipment. Understanding of related disciplines such as microbiology, chemistry, physiology, anatomy and their relationships to medical technology. Knowledge of various regulatory laws, including OSHA, Privacy Act and HIPAA laws. SUPERVISION: The supervisor makes assignments by defining objectives, priorities, and deadlines. The medical technologist plans and carries out tests/examinations following commonly accepted and understood instructions, guidelines, and/or laboratory manuals. Recurring work for which proficiency has been demonstrated is subject to cursory review and spot checks. The contractor is expected to recognize and solve problems related thereto without supervisory or other assistance. Work involving modifications, adaptation or extension of established guides, methods and practices is subject to a primary evaluation check through quality control and/or any other such procedures which are used to validate the accuracy and reliablity of results attained. SUPERVISOR: Karen Gibson, Medical Technologist; ALTERNATE: Marjory Parrill, Medical Technologist. GUIDELINES: The Medical Technologist has available a variety of guidelines including established methodology and instrument manuals, precedents in work, trade literature, technical references, established accrediting guidelines, regulations, policies and agency practices. The Medical Technologist uses judgement in evaluating, interpreting, selecting and applying the guidelines to specific situations and requirements. The guidelines are not always completely applicable to, nor specific for, all the requirements and problems of the work. Therefore, the Medical Technologist must also exercise judgement in adapting and modifying the established guides to solve problems encountered, in applying established methods and practices in new situations or in relating new assignments to precedent ones. The Medical Technologist exercises initiative to adapt general guidelines to the specific conditions and equipment available and modify them to reflect the standards and experience of technologists. The contractor maintains up to date knowledge of new developments in the fields and exercises judgement to evaluate their usefulness and recommend adoption by the clinic. COMPLEXITY: The assignments consist of a variety of clinical laboratory/radiology duties, performing a full range of standardized tests, often operating complex equipment in order to obtain results. To perform the tests/examinations, the appropriate samples/exams must be selected, depending on the physician's request and the substances involved. The contractor must be able to troubleshoot complex problems when unexpected results occur. In troubleshooting problems and in selecting new methods to try out and implement, the objectives to be met and the properties which can be readily determined of the substances/exams involved must be considered in relation to the underlying technological principles of the methods described in the literature. Typically, problems can ordinarily be solved by modification of the method or procedure, or by instrument adjustment (recalibration, verification, maintenance). The contractor often plays major role in repairing complex electronic equipment via phone consultations. SCOPE AND EFFECT: The purpose of the work is to operate the lab/x-ray section of the ambulatory care clinic to provide accurate and substantive examinations/tests for the medical staff in appropriately diagnosing and treating various diseases and trauma states, or in providing good preventitive medical care. The work involves performing a full range of standardized chemical analyses/tests/exams, using various complex instruments/reagents, following established policies and procedures. Occasionally, new methods must be established by performing, evaluating, and modifying methods not currently carried out in the laboratory/radiology department. The work efforts affect the accuracy, reliability and acceptability of the services provided by the laboratory/radiology department for the immediate medical community. PERSONAL CONTACTS: Primary personal contacts with the user population, to include all ages with various disease states, illnesses, deformities, injuries or handicaps. Other major contacts are with other Medical Technologists, Radiologic Technicians and other support staff within the lab/x-ray department, with other clinic and administrative staff of the facility and Indian Health Service, and with the various vendors. Telephone contacts with patients, vendors and other staff members are frequent. PURPOSE OF CONTACTS: The purpose of personal contacts is primarily to deliver high quality laboratory/x-ray care to the service population. Factual information is exchanged as well as planning and coordinating work with others.

Due to space limitations, the work area is not handicapped accessible except in patient contact areas. WORK ENVIRONMENT: The work is performed in the laboratory/x-ray setting with a well-lighted and a temperature-controlled enviornment. Special safety precautions are required, including Universal Precautions. The work involves regular and recurring exposure to bloodborne pathogens, infectious materials and irritant chemicals.

Classes typically begin at 0800 and end at 1630 on each day with a ten (10) minute break every hour and an hour for lunch.  Occasional non-standard training days may be required by emergencies, and operational commitments; therefore, in these cases, as much prior notification as possible will be provided to the contractor.  However, the course is designed for whole days and should not vary substantially from this format, e.g., ending after a half-day on the last day, two-hour lunches or ending class two hours early on days in the middle of the week.  Likewise, extending past the normal ending time can only be done with the student?s option since many students may have off-hour commitments.

Inability of Contractor to Perform

In the event that an instructor is unable to teach a class due to illness, injury or death, the contractor must have a Contingency Plan (CP) in place to replace that instructor within twenty-four (24) hours at their own expense.

Such plans must be included along with the Technical Proposal and may be reviewed by the COTR at any time after award.

The maximum class size of the Forklift and Weight Handling Course is twenty five (25) students. While it is considered extremely unlikely that this will occur due to the high demand for this training, the government reserves the right to cancel a convening with fewer than thirteen (13) students at no cost/penalty to the government.  The contractor will be notified no later than twenty-one (21) days prior to the first day of the class, if the minimum class size is not met.

The government will monitor his/her progress through a review of student critiques and, if necessary, a technical review.  It is expected that the instructional staff remain reasonably constant throughout the duration of the contract.

The Contracting Officer (KO) will inform the contractor directly of individuals who are acceptable.   Unacceptable documentation will be returned to the contractor indicating the reason(s) for rejection.  The KO will have the right to obtain, from the contractor, substantiation of information contained in any resume.

Quality Control

The contractor shall conduct training as specified on the topical outline of the course. The contractor is responsible for establishing, maintaining and monitoring the quality control of the services provided here under via a detailed Quality Control Plan (QCP) (Due with the Technical Proposal) clearly stating his/her procedures for ensuring quality.  As part of the above plan, the contractor shall establish and maintain an instructor evaluation system.  Records of all instructor evaluations for contract employees shall be kept current, complete and available to the Contracting Officer or COTR upon request during the performance of this contract.

<DESC>Additional Questions and Answers from prospective contractors, as they relate to amendment 0001 of the solicitation: 1)	Question:&I must protest the &solicitation based on the changes in amendment 0001. Specifically, CLINs 0007AE, 0008AE, and 0009AE, the increase in drayage beyond the area of performance from 50 miles to 110 miles.  The increase in miles would cause driv ers to violate the 14 hour rule set forth in section 395 of FMCSA rules. Answer: The answer to this question is the same as the answer to question #2. 2)	Question:  We protest SubCLIN 0007AE and all other SubCLIN in amendment one that pertain to drayage beyond the area of performance. Answer to Questions # 1 & # 2:  SubCLINs 0007AE, 0008AE and 0009AE, Drayage Beyond Area of Performance descriptions are being revised to read 'not to exceed 50 miles,' as stated in the original solicitation. 3)	Question:  Item number 0005AG and all other items regarding Contractor Manpower Reporting require one flat price since there is only one unit in the quantity section.  If this contract is extended as per FAR 52.217-8 there is no provision for the extra work involved in complying with the Manpower Reporting Requirement.  Will this requirement be waived?  Is not, how will we be compensated for the extra work involved&Would you allow the contractor to double his bid price for the aforementioned item for the  6-month extension period? Answer:  The Contractor Manpower Reporting requirement will not be waived.  Please be advised that the Contract Manpower Reporting shall be the period of performance not to exceed 12 months ending 30 September of each Government fiscal year and must be rep orted by 30 October of each calendar year.  However, at the time of extension, it the contractor submits a proposed cost, this will be negotiated prior to the extension.  4)	Question:  You have failed to provide instructions as to how the Amendments of Solicitation is to be acknowledged for Amendment 1. Answer:  Please acknowledge amendments number 0001, 0002, and 0003 in blocks number 15A, 15B and 15C.  --------------------------------------------------- Please note that the postings under W91QF2-07-T-0013 relate to solicitation W91QF2-07-T-0003.  Please disregard the number W91QF2-07-T-0013. For ease in reading, the information that should have been posted under W91QF2-07-T-0003, but was shown under W91QF2-07-T-0013, is repeated here. The response date/time for receipt of quotes is being extended to November 30, 2006, at 2 P.M. Questions and answers from the pre-proposal conference: 1)	 Question: Regarding page 6, SubCLIN 0001AD: Contractor-furnished containers: Whose responsibility is it to transport the Government-owned containers from the inbound contractor's facility to the outbound contractor's facility?  If the one responsible f or transporting the containers is in a different area of performance, will that contractor receive additional compensation for traveling outside their area of performance? Answer: The outbound contractor, when directed by the ordering officer, shall pick up and store empty Government-owned containers from carriers from all areas of performance under the solicitation. This will apply to SubCLINs 0001AD, 0002AD, and 0003AD. 2)	Question: Regarding page 7, SubCLIN 0001AF:Unaccompanied Baggage  Residence:  Shouldn't the unit of issue read 'Hundred Weight (Short),' not 'Shipment?' Answer: Yes. The solicitation SubCLIN is being modified accordingly. 3)	Question:  Regarding page 71, Contract Manpower Reporting.  Are we allowed to quote a rate of Manpower Reporting that is greater than the cost of 20 hours of work? Answer: Please quote as you feel is appropriate. 4)	Question:  Regarding page 71, Contract Manpower Reporting.  It reads:  'The required information includes& (2) Contract number, including task and delivery order number.'  Do we have to report each shipment for a member separately, or can he report one figure for the entire contract? Answer:  Please assume that you have to report for all shipments as a whole. For informational purposes, the amounts you propose for the SubCLINs for Contract Manpower Reporting on the bids that you win will be combined into one new CLIN for one Contract M anpower Report, with a price equal to a total of the prices you bid for the Reporting on the CLINs that you win. 5)	Question:  There are occasions when reweighing is required.  Are you going to include a SubCLIN for reweighing? Answer:  At this point in time, no SubCLIN will be included for reweighing. If required, it will be addressed at that time. 6)	Question: Regarding page 30, SubCLIN 0007AB: Storage, including warehouse handling (for intra-city and intra-area moves).  The SubCLIN states that in extraordinary circumstances, storage will be authorized for one period of up to eight (8) days.  What i f the period has to be longer than eight days? Answer:  The up-to-eight-day storage period is for extraordinary circumstances.   The SubCLIN will remain as written. 7)    Question:  Regarding page 32, SubCLIN 0007AE:  Drayage beyond are of performance.  The SubCLIN allows drayage, not to exceed 50 miles, commencing from the outer boundary of the contract area of performance to the destination point.

<DESC>Standard Procurement System Joint Program Office Objectives: The contractors overall objective is to provide the full range of services to support the SPS JPMO PM and Program Office Staff in meeting cost, schedule, performance and other functions normally required of a Defense ACAT IAC Program.   Acceptable performance for each task in the Statement of Objectives will be based on timeliness and quality to meet the objectives as they related to the specific task.  The Contractor shall propose performance metrics that define and address these factors . REVISED Organizational Conflict of Interest FAR 9.505-1 -- Providing Systems Engineering and Technical Direction. (a) A contractor that provides systems engineering and technical direction for a system but does not have overall contractual responsibility for its development, its integration, assembly, and checkout, or its production shall not -- (1) Be awarded a contract to supply the system or any of its major components; or (2) Be a subcontractor or consultant to a supplier of the system or any of its major components. (b) Systems engineering includes a combination of substantially all of the following activities: determining specifications, identifying and resolving interface problems, developing test requirements, evaluating test data, and supervising design. Technical  direction includes a combination of substantially all of the following activities: developing work statements, determining parameters, directing other contract operations, and resolving technical controversies.  In performing these activities, a contracto r occupies a highly influential and responsible position in determining a systems basic concepts and supervising their execution by other contractors.  Therefore this contractor should not be in a position to make decisions favoring its own products or ca pabilities. The parties acknowledge that during the performance of this contract resulting from this solicitation that the Contractor may require access to certain proprietary and confidential information (whether in its original or derived form) submitted to or produced by the developer. Such information includes, but is not limited t o, business practices, proposals, designs, mission or operation concepts, sketches, management policies, cost and operating expense data, technical data and trade secrets, proposed JPMO budgetary information, and acquisition planning or acquisition actions , obtained either directly or indirectly as a result of the effort performed on behalf of JPMO. The Contractor shall take appropriate steps not only to safeguard such information, but also to prevent disclosure of such information to any party other than t he Government. The Contractor agrees to indoctrinate company personnel who will have access to or custody of the information concerning the nature of the confidential terms under which they received such information and shall stress that the information sh all not be disclosed to any other party or to Contractor personnel who do not need to know the contents thereof for the performance of the contract. Contractor personnel shall also be informed that they shall not engage in any other action, venture or empl oyment wherein this information will be used for any purpose by any other party. The contractor shall include as part of the proposal submitted in response to this combined synopsis/solicitation a mitigation plan that separately addresses the three major categories of organizational conflict:  unequal access to information, biased grou nd rules, and impaired objectivity. Each has separate elements of proof and may require different mitigation strategies. Clauses incorporated:  52.219-8 and 52.219-9
