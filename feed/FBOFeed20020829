<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration, Center for Veterinary  Medicine (CVM), has a requirement entitled "Immunochemical Testing of High Temperature Meat and Bone Meal" in which the objective of the contract is to conduct immunochemical analysis using antibodies prepared against bovine meat and bone meal (BMBM) for their binding characteristics against bovine meat and bone prepared in accordance with European Union (E.U.) guidelines for temperature and pressure.  Contractors will identify a common source of bovine material to be processed into BMBM at various conditions of temperature and pressure.  Materials for processing the variously prepared BMBM samples will be purchased along with reagents needed for ELISA and Western Blot Analysis. All needed training of the staff will be performed during this period. The contractor and the project officer will arrange to meet before the end of this period to coordinate activities to be conducted in both laboratories.  The contractor and OR staff working on this project will also communicate as needed via telephone, fax, and e-mail. The contractor will determine if the currently available antibodies are suitable for detection of the target antigen in the differently rendered BMBM. This will be done by either ELISA and/or Western Blot Analysis. The contractor will advise CVM if it appears that additional antibodies will need to be produced. The decision to produce new antibodies, if needed, will be made in consultation with CVM. Part of these discussions will be a determination of whether CVM or the contractor should prepare these antibodies. If it is decided that CVM should produce these new antibodies, the contractor will work with CVM to prepare these antibodies. This will include, but is not limited to, preparing materials for CVM to use in producing new antibodies, screening these antibodies, and development of any new testing procedure.  It is the decision of FDA/CVM that this requirement be awarded on a Sole Source basis to Dr. Michael Ansfield, Veterinary Laboratories Agency, Ludington Regional Centre, located at Strtford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire CV379SJ, United Kingdom. Dr. Ansfield?s possesses extensive experience in the immunochemical analysis of animal feed and feed ingredients for bovine derived materials.  Dr. Ansfield and his collegues also have extensive experience in testing animal feed and feed ingredients for the presence of materials derived from other species. He and his colleagues were the first to prepare antibodies specific to BMBM.  In addition, they have perhaps the only collection of antisera capable of detecting either porcine meat and bone meal or poultry meal.  Dr. Ansfield also has access to rendering facilities capable of preparing meat and bone meal over a wide range of temperature and pressure.  They also have extensive experience in the testing of complete feed and feed ingredients.  Therefore, based on the above, this requirement will be awarded on a sole source basis.  No solicitation will result from this announcement.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for a Prodigy Plus Office Modeling System with WaterWorks Soluble Release Material Package.  The Prodigy Plus is an advanced technology, 3 dimensional product validation and visualization rapid prototype machine capable of creating models from Acrylonitrile-Butadiene-Styrene (ABS) plastic.  This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP).	The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase this item from Stratasys, Inc. of Eden Prairie, MN as the only responsible source and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements.  The Prodigy Plus uses the fused deposition modeling (FDM) process: the only process that models in ABS plastic.  ABS plastic is a durable material, which allows for the fabrication of working prototypes.  The Prodigy Plus is equipped with WaterWorks, a design tool available only through Stratasys, which allows for the creation of mechanisms whose moving parts are built pre-assembled by the prototype machine. WaterWorks is a unique and patented technology, which has not been licensed to any other manufacturer and no other technology will meet the government's requirement. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:00 p.m. local time on 4 September 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED.   This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-20. The following provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition: 1) 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial (OCT 2000); 2) 52.212-3, Offeror, Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items; 3) 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items (APR 1998), with an addendum; and 4) 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items (AUG 2000).  Solicitation Number 1435-01-02-RP-85325 MONTCRDK 7.52 DOCUMENTATION is issued as a request for proposals (RFP). The Minerals Management Service (MMS) by virtue of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Lands Act, the Submerged Lands Act, and pursuant to delegation of authority by the Secretary of the Interior has jurisdiction over leasing and development of OCS submerged lands and mineral development. In conjunction with this jurisdiction, the MMS is required to follow the overall Mineral Management goals as stated in the OCS Lands Act Amendments of 1978.  Related to the MMS's responsibilities under the OCS Lands Act is staff analysis of environmental and resource information in conjunction with OCS oil and gas lease sales. The bid adequacy analysis for bids received at blocks offered for lease attempts to ensure that the Federal Government receives fair market value for those blocks. A procedure for reviewing bids and determining whether they are adequate has been developed by MMS.  To assist in placing values on these blocks, computer models are used. The proprietary computer program used by MMS in the determination of the fair market value of a block is called MONTCAR (Monte Carlo Simulation Program). The mathematical methodology and statistical approach by the model is critical to ensure the correct fair market value assessment. The Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS) intends to competitively award a contract to rewrite portions of MONTCRDK 7.52, modernize the source code, and update the documentation of the MONTCRDK version 7.52. Since the early 1970's, MMS has consistently modified the MONTCAR Program model using Fortran and Assembly.   A detailed documentation of MONTCAR version 6.26 was completed in 1996.  Subsequent documentation has not been inclusive.  The model methodology and source code has evolved since then to comply with many policy adjustments such as royalty suspension and technology innovations. @Risk Developers Kit from Palisades Corporation has been one of more recent, major technology implementations.  MONTCAR unofficially became MONTCRDK (version 7.02) to reflect the additional RDK features.   These features have not been documented, as well as other concepts such as changes in royalties, old vs. new infrastructure, etc.   MONTCRDK has never been documented, and MONTCAR was last documented with version - MONTCAR 6.26.   Not all of the source code reflects a modern naming convention, and structure.   MMS would like to have the most recent version, MONTCRDK 7.52 (to be release in November 2002), rewritten in parts and the model documentation updated. MONTCRDSK is proprietary and information concerning it must not be disclosed.  The Contractor will be required to sign a non-disclosure agreement.    ESTIMATED LEVEL OF EFFORT:  The government estimates a period of performance for this contract of twelve (12) months and an approximate cost of $62,500.  SCOPE OF WORK:  The Contractor shall:  (1)provide updates of the written methodology documentation.  MONTCAR 6.26 methodology documentation and user's manual will be given to the contractor.  Other information will be provided to the contractor to give insight as to the design of the model and changes.   The methodology is not the primary focus of this contract;   (2)  standardize and modify the MONTCAR 7.52 code. MONTCAR 7.52 has been a major rewrite from 7.50 and 7.28.  Some of the naming conventions have not been updated to reflect  recent changes in the Fortran language Some of the code was written using Fortran 66/77 with a non-modular structure; other parts of the program are Fortran 90 in style and syntax.  MMS recommends using parts of an industry standard architecture such as ISO/IEEE 12207.   However, MMS is open to a recommendation of standard by the contractor.  By applying this method or a similar method Contractor shall maintain attributes such as quality, robustness, and assurances.  Once MMS decides on the standardization method the Contractor shall modify the code.  Monthly reviews are required with the submission of hard copy and electronic copy;   (3)  Contractor shall review, and recommend a standard naming convention for the functions and subroutines within MONTCRDK.  One naming standard is the use of Hungarian notation as opposed to the current MONTCAR naming convention.  A new, more standard naming convention is not the only part of the source code that needs to be rewritten.  Other rewrite aspects include code structure, additional modularization with subroutines as opposed to entries; and reduced common blocks with an increase in parameter passing via subroutines and functions. In regards to data types, types if possible. The use of types would allow tighter and easier maintained code. Eventually, the program could interface with a database like Microsoft Access instead of ASCII flat files.  There may be other areas that the contractor can make recommendations such as code reuse, libraries, etc. that can be discussed either through a monthly teleconference, meeting, or written submittal.   MMS concurrence is required. before any standardization is implemented  Once MMS decides  the standardization method, the Contractor will modify the code.  Reviews will take place on a monthly basis or after a major section has been completed by submittal of both hard copy and electronic copy;  (4) Develop an overall testing strategy after the software has been improved. After the test approach is finalized, the Contractor shall write a Test Plan. The Test Plan must include the tests, the data used, any automation incorporated, and the expected results.  Some of the tests that should be considered are functional, integration, performance, and regression testing. The completed Test Plan and input files will be submitted to MMS for review and analysis and testing.  Contractor shall make the subsequent fixes to the software as identified in the testing.  The contractor is NOT responsible for making source code revisions or documenting the two graphics programs WMCPlot and AVisual; and the @Risk interface program, grisk.f90/grisk.f;  (5) The Contract shall document MONTCRDK 7.52 in at least three major parts: operation fundamentals, methodology, and source code.  The documentation shall formulate a comprehensive report. The format is flexible with the concurrence of MMS.  These three parts were in the MONTCAR 6.26 documentation. Some of these parts will have little or no change, but others may require substantial updating depending on the level of change and complexity.   (a) Operation Fundamentals:  The Operation Fundamentals section gives the reader an overview of MONTCRDK.   In the past it has covered an overview and history of the program.  The principles have not changed, but the other sections from MONTCAR 6.26 must be updated.  The subsections include definitions, basic flow chart, installation and operation, keywords, inputs and outputs, input processor, and reports.   A process flow graph must be included in this section, as well as, other graphs or charts that would benefit the program.  (b) Methodology:  An update of past MONTCAR 6.26 changes is required.   The sections on distribution, dependencies, and correlation have changed significantly with the addition of @Risk.  The geologic section has not changed.   The sections that have changed are the development and production module, economics (royalty suspension), and sampling.  MONTCRDK 7.52 models individual wells and platforms; and ties them to specific traps.  Previous versions use allocation procedures for this.  This version also models the use of existing facilities that has not been documented.   (c)  Source Code: After the source code has been rewritten, it must be documented.  A standardized format is required.  A sample template is in the appendix A. The documentation should include the main program, modules, subroutines, functions, entries, and variables.   Various graphics and/or charts showing the system, process, UML diagrams, and program flowcharts should be done in Microsoft Visio 2000 or later.  Program flowcharts are not necessary for simple routines, but must be done for more complex and more critical routines. A  template created and used for MONTCRDK 7.28 documentation effort is incomplete. A standard template will be created and used as a basis for all functions, modules, program, and subroutines for consistency. This template design (Appendix A) includes eight sections starting with (1) purpose; (2) method; (3) include, use, entry, and call statements; (4) subroutine or function variables - name, purpose, type, line numbers; (5) functions called by subroutine, or function; (6) flowchart of the subroutine, or functions; (7) miscellaneous comments; and (8) source code. Before source code documentation begins, the source code template will be set     SCHEDULE:  The overall schedule for this effort is:  Kick-off meeting at Hendon within 1 month of the completion of MONTCRDK 7.52 or NTE two months after the contract award date;  Monthly reports each month after the kick-off date;  completion of the Revised Source Code meeting and oral presentation after the completed revision or six months after the kick-off date;  midterm written report to MMS six months after the kickoff date; draft report to MMS eight months after the kickoff date;  Final meeting and oral presentation nine months after the kickoff date;  final written report to MMS 10 months after the kick off date;  consulting availability from kickoff date to end of contract.  There will be a minimum monthly meetings (with an agreed upon location) or teleconferences,.  Prior to any meetings the Contractor shall provide written documentation for review.  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:   The official version of MONTCAR 7.52 will be available the middle of November 2002. The MMS will provide  the contractor one (1) copy of the complete MONTCRDK 7.52 source code, MONTCAR ver. 6.26 documentation, current MONTCAR user' guide, design documents, test data, and user interface program on CD-ROM.  The MMS will also provide the following compilers or programs: One (1) copy each of Compaq Digital Fortran version 6.6; One (1) copy of Autoflow;  One (1) copy of Cleanscape  (Fortran Lint);  One (1) copy of @Risk 3.5;  One (1) copy of the @Risk Developers Kit.  A signed receipt will be required, as will a statement agreeing not to copy for personal or corporate use or to publish, present, discuss or distribute any of these documents to any other organization or individual.   The contractor will upon completion or termination of the contract return all materials given to the contractor by MMS. In addition, the contractor must include a document stating that all materials related to the contract have been returned to MMS or destroyed;  that the information and software developed from this study has and will not be published, presented, discussed, distributed to any organization or individual other than MMS in any form. All copies of notes, reports, executable files, source code listings digital or otherwise not returned to MMS must be destroyed immediately upon completion or termination of this contract.  HOW TO RESPOND: Offerors must submit a Capabilities Statement, a Technical Proposal and a firm fixed price.  CAPABILITIES STATEMENT:  In order to compete for this contract, interested parties must demonstrate that they are qualified to perform the work by providing a Capabilities Statement detailing: (1) your key personnel  and organizational experience  and facilities in simulation and computer programming; and  (2) past performance including specific references (include contract number & project description, period of performance, dollar amount, client identification with the point of contact & telephone number) for previous work of this nature that your key personnel or organization is currently performing or has completed  within the last three years.  References will be checked.  TECHNICAL PROPOSAL:  detail how you plan to approach the project and tasks;  include a time schedule indicating benchmarks;  specify key personnel, their specific functions and reporting relationships. Indicate who will be the primary point of contact for this project.  COST PROPOSAL:  this will be a firm fixed price type contract.

<SUBJECT>C--Firm Fixed Price Contract for A-E Services related to Thermal Stress/Strain Analysis of the Roller Compacted Concrete Thick Arch Dam at the Portugues Dam site, Ponce, Puerto Rico
<SOLNBR>DACW17-02-R-0032
<RESPDATE>101102
<ARCHDATE>12102002
<CONTACT>Sara Pines, 904-232-2083
<DESC>NA A-E Services are required to perform the thermal stress/strain analysis for a roller compacted concrete (RCC) thick arch dam at the Portugues Dam site near Ponce, Puerto Rico.  This solicitation is unrestricted and is open to all firms regardless of size.  One (1) contract will be awarded from responses to this advertisement.  The contract will be Firm-Fixed Price. Project Information: Upon completion of construction and after natural cooling to the dams final stable temperature condition the dam will be r equired to behave monolithically while supporting its service loads.  The thermal stress/strain analyses shall determine the optimal combination of placement temperature and contraction joint spacing to protect against both transverse and longitudinal ther mal cracking.  The analysis will consider the cost effectiveness and potential benefits of both a contraction joint grouting program and, because of the mild and uniform climate, pre-cooling to achieve a 'just closed' or natural closure condition at the ti me the mass reaches its final stable temperature condition.  It will also determine the stress free temperature in the dam for all construction scenarios, which will be used in the evaluation of the ability of the dam to resist service loads.  Factors for Evaluation in order of Priority are: 1. Specialized Experience and Technical Competence: Firms must clearly demonstrate specialized experience and expertise in the analysis of mass concrete structures.  In particular, firms must demonstrate: experience ana lyzing comparable structures in similar thermal and seismic settings, experience performing the required structural analyses including appropriate constitutive modeling, and experience modeling the loss or gain of heat through the top surface of one foot t hick RCC lifts.  Firms must demonstrate understanding and familiarity of the principles discussed in the Corps of Engineers, Engineering Technical Letter, ETL 1110-2-365, Nonlinear, Incremental Structural Analysis of Massive Concrete Structures.  2. Size a nd Expertise of Staff:  Firm must have in-house or through association with qualified subcontractors, U.S. registered professional engineers that will fill all analysis, oversight and supervisory roles necessary to complete the required analyses.  3. Capac ity to Accomplish the Work in the Required Time:  Firm must have the capacity to commence work within 10 days after receipt of notification to proceed and accomplish the analyses in accordance with the scheduled completion dates.  These dates will be set i n the scope of work and will be dependant on the schedule and progress of the RCC mix design and material property testing.  4. Past Performance: Firm must demonstrate its past performance in accomplishment of similar work.  Firm must submit information fo r current relevant contracts and subcontracts including the name, address, and telephone number of references. (Relevancy is defined in the DOD guide to collection and use of past performance as information that has a logical connection with the matter un der consideration and application time span.) Pertinent issues are ability to meet established schedules, ability to accomplish work within budgetary limitations, and quality of the delivered product.  Past performance on contracts with Federal Government  agencies, state and local governments, and private industry regarding quality and timeliness of work will be reviewed.  Past DOD experience data available to the Government through the A-E Contract Administration System (ACASS) and information available f rom other sources, will be utilized for prior performance evaluations. Firm may include supporting information in the proposal, such as letters of commendation from clients, on past performance on recent similar contracts.  Firm may also include informatio n on problems encountered in prior contracts and discuss actions taken to remedy unsatisfactory performance.   THE FOLLOWING SECONDARY CRITERIA WILL BE USED AS  TIEBREAKERS:  5. SMALL BUSINESS AND SMALL DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS PARTICIPATION:  The extent of participation of SB, SDB, historically black colleges and universities (HBCU), and minority institutions (MI) will be measured as a percentage of the total anti cipated contract effort, regardless of whether the SB, SDB, HBCU, or MI is a prime contractor, or joint venture partner; the greater the participation, the greater the consideration.  6.  VOLUME OF PAST DOD CONTRACT AWARDED TO FIRM:  Work previously awarde d to the firm by DOD will be reviewed with the objective of effecting equitable distribution of contracts among equally qualified firms. Submission Requirements: Firms meeting the requirements described in this announcement and wishing to be considered, must submit one copy each of SF 254 and SF 255 for the firm or joint venture and SF 254 for each subcontractor. In Block 4 of SF 255 list o nly the office personnel for the office to perform the work which is indicated in Block 3B. Additional personnel strengths, including consultants should be indicated parenthetically, and their source clearly identified. In Block 7G of the SF 255, indicate specific project experience for key team members and indicate the team member's role on each listed project (architect, project manager, etc.). Submittal of supplemental attachments to SF 255 addressing evaluation factors 1-4 is strongly recommended. Submi ttal package must be received in this office at the address indicated below, no later than 4:00 P.M. Eastern Time on October 11, 2002. Submittals received after this date and time will not be considered. Unnecessarily elaborate brochures or other presentat ions beyond those sufficient to present a complete and effective response to this announcement are not desired. The Director of Defense Procurement has issued a final rule requiring that contractors must be registered in the CCR before receiving a contract  from any activity of the Department of Defense. The rule authorizes contracting officers to reject offers from contractors that have not registered. (The CCR's web site may be accessed at http://www.ccr.gov) Small and small disadvantaged business firms ar e encouraged to participate as prime contractors or as members of joint ventures with other small businesses. If a contract exceeds $500,000.00, all interested firms are reminded that the successful firm will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximu m practicable extent with small and small disadvantaged firms in accordance with the provisions of Public Law 95-507. If a large business firm is selected for a contract exceeding $500,000.00, the firm must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requiremen t for a subcontracting plan on that part of the work it intends to subcontract. Of those dollars the large business firm intends to subcontract out, the Corps of Engineers target goals for subcontracting are 71.1% to Small Business concerns; 10.2% to Small  Disadvantaged Business concerns; 10.0% to Women-owned Small Business concerns; 3.0% for HUBZone certified concerns; 5.0% Veteran-owned small business concerns; and 3.0% to Service-disabled Veteran-owned Small Business concerns.  Large firms should keep th ese target goals in mind when considering qualifications of potential subcontractors and ensure that each proposed subcontractor's socio-economic status is clearly identified in the submission of qualifications. If applicable, an approved small business-su bcontracting plan will be required prior to award. The NAICS code is 541330. The size standard is $4,000,000.00.  Response to this ad should be in writing only; telephone calls and personal visits are discouraged.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Advanced Technology Center (ATC), plans to procure a Ventana Discovery System for Microarrays from Ventana  Medical Systems, Inc., 3865 North Business Center Drive, Tucson, AZ 85705. The supplies and services herein are commercial as defined in FAR Part 12, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program for using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR Part 13.5.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 421450 and the business size standard is 100 employees.  The NCI ATC has a significant experimental investment in array technologies and is looking into instrumentation that helps the NCI researcher in increasing the throughput and reliability in his/her research.  The ATC and the Microarray Facility requires an instrument which can handle a large number of slides (10 or more) at a time to facilitate studies in gene expression, protein arrays, tissue arrays and other studies.  Minimum Requirements: 1) Individual temperature controlled thermo pads to allow precise target temperatures ranging from ambient to 95oC to tightly control denaturation, hybridization and stringency conditions;  2) Automated fluidics module (AFM) to provide precise delivery of bulk aqueous solutions such as buffers, stringency washes, etc.  The open architecture of the AFM provides flexibility to accommodate future needs and; 3) Software shall be flexible so that the researcher can use multiple probe configurations (oligos, riboprobes, cDNAs, etc) on 20 different slides each with unique protocols (temperature, time, stringency, etc.); and 4) The instrument shall be modular so that an increase in output at a later date can be done by addition of new hybridization modules.  Ventana Medical Systems, Inc. is the only source known to NCI with an instrument which has: 1) a unique air vortexing and patented liquid coverslip technology.  This mixing technology in combination with individual temperature controlled ThermoPads(TM) provides reproducible, consistent microarray hybridizations; 2) a patented microdelivery reagent dispense system that allows precise delivery of 100ul or probe or any required reagent which provides flexibility for optimum application development; 3) patented technology that enhances in situ hybridization kinetics which not only speeds up the time required for experimentation but can be used for multiple research applications. The same instrument can be used for protein and tissue arrays, allowing the instrument to be used by a variety of investigators. This instrument will not only increase throughput of arrays experiments, but also will improve the quality of the data and make it easier to reproduce data from experiment to experiment.  This is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if it can meet the above minimum specifications described herein.  Capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1:00 PM EDT (local Washington D.C. time) on September 6, 2002.   If you have and questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent via electronic mail at holdcram@excange.nih.gov or by fax at (301) 402-4513.

The Baylor University group also possesses extensive knowledge in the area of gastroenterology, which is deemed necessary to interpret the data.  However, if any interested party believes it too can meet the above, it may submit a capabilities statment.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the Government needs.  Capability statement must be received in the contracting office no later than September 16, 2002.  This action is pursuant to 41 USC 253(1) and under the authority of FAR 6.301-1.  The requirement will be procured as a non-commercial item in accordance with FAR Part 13.  If you have any questions please contact Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent (301) 402-4509. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a compeitive procurment.  The NAICS Code: 541990 and the business size standard is $6.0 Million.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to negotiate on a sole source basis from Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC for the period September 23, 2002 to September 22, 2003 with option for three (3) additional years.  The purpose of this order is to obtain the services of B. Lynn Whitener, DrPH., and her colleagues at the Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research to provide expert enhancement of the NLM Database of Health Services Research Resources (HSRR).  The contractor, using their expert HSR and public health subject and technical knowledge of North Carolina state level data, shall: 1) evaluate North Carolina state data tools, including datasets, instruments/indices and analytical software, for appropriateness for the HSRR; 2) add individual in-depth records with preformatted subject PubMed searches for identified tools; and 3) apply keywords to records that are not retrieved via the standard search mechanism.  This project requires a detailed and broad understanding of various types of North Carolina state datasets, survey instruments, and other tools useful for health services research including public health.  Dr. B. Lynn Whitener has a PhD in Public Health and masters in library science.  She is experienced in several aspects of health services research that rely on use of datasets and surveys.  Dr. Whitener developed an in-house database of HSR instruments that she is sharing with the NLM.  Additionally, Dr. Whitener has a familiarity with NLM electronic formats, as The Sheps Center for Health Services Research is the organization that creates and submits electronic records for the NLM HSRProj database.  The Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research is one of the nation's oldest and largest health services research centers.  Located on the campus of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the center encompasses an interdisciplinary program of research, consultation, technical assistance and training focusing on the accessibility, adequacy, organization, cost and effectiveness of health care services.  Sheps Center staff regularly conduct research with datasets for projects studying hospital networks, nursing home residents' attitudes, childhood immunizations receipt, measure of medical under service, and telemedicine.  This work encompasses identifying, locating and evaluating the usefulness of data files and/or instruments for projects.  The Center's expert health services researchers frequently use data sources such as physician supply, general demographics, rural/urban indicators, and hospital survey information.  Staff use data files for specific projects such as disease incidence, locations of federally supported health clinics, regional economic indicators, residential socioeconomic status indicators, population projections, industry-specific employment, toxic waste sites, and hospital discharge data.  Additionally, Sheps Center staff have developed several North Carolina state data systems including the North Carolina Health Professions Data System.  Dr. Whitener and her team are expert health services researchers and librarians skilled in identification, evaluation and analysis and use of HSR and public health datasets and instruments and searching HSR information systems and are, therefore, uniquely qualified to evaluate North Carolina data tools and identify those suitable for the HSRR database and to create in-depth individual records for them.  The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisitions.  This notice of intent is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the NLM.

The North American Industry Classification System code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6M. 
Background: The Special Studies Institutional Review Board (SSIRB) is one of two institutional review boards (IRBs) at the National Cancer Institute.  In accordance with 45 CFR 46, the NCI IRBs provide prospective review and approval of all human subject research activities to protect the rights and welfare of humans who are the subjects of the research.  The SSIRB primarily reviews NCI intramural epidemiologic studies, behavioral research, and cancer prevention clinical trials which do not involve treatment of patients diagnosed with cancer. 
As specified in the NIH Multiple Project Assurance (MPA), the NCI IRBs meet on a monthly basis to review new protocols for approval of implementation; requests for changes or amendments to ongoing protocols; and (annually) ongoing studies for approval for continuation.  Principal investigators for the intramural projects interact with IRB chairs and membership to meet the stipulations and recommendations resulting from the IRB deliberations, to assure protections of participants from research risks and ethical conduct of research.  Minutes of the SSIRB meetings and records of interactions with investigators are maintained according to regulations, and, following SSIRB approval, protocols are tracked through NIH Clinical Center implementation committee reviews to final approval.  In addition to its responsibilities for protocol review and approval, the SSIRB has recently accepted delegated responsibility for issuing Certificates of Confidentiality to protect personally identified research data from subpoena for legal proceedings.  A SSIRB subcommittee meets on a monthly basis to review applications from intramural and extramural investigators funded through the NCI and issues Certificates as appropriate for research involving personally identified information which, if released, could result in stigmatization or other personal harm for the research subject.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) plans to issue a purchase order on a sole source basis to Ted Allen, Silver Spring, MD, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b), simplified acquisition procedures. The objective of this requirement is to review the Business Reporting System Technology and Prior Work and Development of Assessment Guide for the Advanced Technology Program. Mr. Allen is uniquely qualified to perform the proposed work. His academic experience, at the Doctorate and Masters Level, and subsequent professional work directly involved human information processing and quantitative models of cognition, i.e., underlying survey methodology issues. His additional MBA Degree training gave him substantial business and economics training. He subsequently gained substantial industry and consulting experience in applying this body of knowledge in survey design and testing, market research, and market management in several years of experience with Verizon. More recently, he has specialized in developing web surveys.

BISNIS products and services include the monthly BISNIS Bulletin newsletter, a number of lead opportunity programs, direct business counseling, and a range of information on Russian and Newly Independent States (NIS) regions, industry developments, and market access strategies made available to interested representatives of U.S. companies by mail , email and via the BISNIS Internet web site, www.bisnis.doc.gov .

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>SECTION  SF 30 BLOCK 14 CONTINUATION PAGE 
 
 
  
SUMMARY OF CHANGES 

Changes in Solicitation/Contract/Order Form 

     The required response date/time has changed from 06-Sep-2002 00:00 to 06-Sep-2002 
     12:00
      

 
Changes in Section SF 1449 
 
 
  
The following clauses which are incorporated by full text have been added or modified: 

 
52.212-1      INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2000) 

52.212-2     EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)

ADDENDUM TO FAR 52-212-2 EVALUATION OF COMMERCIAL ITEMS JAN 1999 
EVALUATION CRITERIA.
	Section ?E? of the solicitation describes in detail the evaluation process and as such, forms the basis of this plan.  
	The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers.
		(a)  Past Performance (see FAR 15.304);
		(b)  Price
Past Performance is significantly more important than price.  Offerors do have the ability to submit a letter stating that their company is without any relevant past and present performance information.  In those cases, the offeror will receive a neutral rating.
	Options.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.
	A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer?s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

	This is a best value competitive acquisition and is conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.101-1, Tradeoff Process.  Award will be made to the offeror who is deemed responsible in accordance with the FAR whose proposal conforms to the RFP?s requirements, and is judged to represent the best value to the Government.  The best value is represented by the most advantageous offer.  

	To arrive at a best value decision, the Contracting Officer (CO) will integrate Past and Present Performance Criteria, Price Criteria, and any other solicitation provisions cited in this document.  The CO is the Source Selection Authority  responsible for the final decision to select a contractor.  The CO will conduct the selection using the procedures specified from the revised Air Force Source Selection policies and procedures contained in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15, DOD FAR Sup, Air Force FAR Sup, and Air Force Appendix DD.  

	The Government evaluation team and the CO will strive for maximum objectivity.  The selection process, by its nature, is subjective and therefore, professional judgement is implicit throughout the entire process.  The Government intends to select one Contractor for the subject solicitation.  However, the Government reserves the right to award no contract at all, depending on the quality of the proposal submitted.  The Government reserves the right to award without discussions.

	EVALUATION CRITERIA AND GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS AND THEIR ORDER OF IMPORTANCE:

	Past and Present Performance Criteria:

	             Past and Present Performance carries greater weight than Price.  Past and Present Performance is the most important factor in the award decision.  

	             The main purpose of the Past and Present Performance evaluation is to appropriately consider each offerors demonstrated record of contract compliance in supplying products and services that meet user?s needs including cost and schedule.

        	Past and Present Performance Information is recent and relevant information regarding a Contractor?s actions under previously awarded contracts.  Recent performance is defined as within the past three (3) years.  Current performance will have a greater impact in the performance confidence assessment than less recent performance.  The offeror?s Past and Present Performance will be evaluated to include:  1) the Contractor?s record of conforming to statement of works and the standards in the operation/management of REFUSE AND RECYCLING services,  2) the Contractor?s history of business relations and management of key personnel; 3) the Contractor?s environmental record; 4) the Contractor?s security record; and 5) the Contractor?s ability to perform quality service and minimize customer complaints.  The offeror shall provide references from both Governmental (federal, state, and local) and non-Government sources related to Refuse and Recycling services.  References should be similar in size and scope to this acquisition or greater to be considered applicable to the evaluation.  Relevant information is defined as a contract for Refuse and Recycling services and waste.     

	The offeror shall fully complete the Offeror?s Performance Information Form (Attachment 1) and send the Past Performance Information Form and Past Performance Questionnaire (Attachment 2) as required in the previous section.  A maximum of ten completed questionnaires will be accepted and evaluated per offeror.

        	Offerors will be given the opportunity to refute any adverse information provided in Past and Present Performance information research (if rebuttal information is not already provided on the form/survey).  The offeror shall limit this rebuttal to addressing the specific negative comments.  The offeror shall clearly distinguish between any rebuttal already provided on a form/survey versus those rebuttals provided for the purposes of this proposal.  The offer may also address relevancy in accordance with FAR 15.306(a)(2).

        	The Government may use Past and Present Performance information obtained from sources other than those identified by the offeror(s).  Information obtained by this method will be used for both the responsibility determination and evaluation decision.  In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant Past and Present Performance or for whom information on Past Performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on Past and Present Performance.

      	Should offerors wish to provide information on problems encountered on the identified contracts and the corrective action taken, please submit such information with proposals as well in accordance with FAR 15.305(2).

      	Past and Present Performance evaluation is accomplished through assignment of a confidence assessment rating based on assessing performance risk.  The rating is as follows: 

Definition	Rating
Based on the offeror?s performance record, essentially no doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.	EXCEPTIONALHigh Confidence
Based on the offeror?s performance record, little doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.	VERY GOODSignificant Confidence
Based on the offeror?s performance record, some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.	SATISFACTORYConfidence
No performance record is identifiable [see FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iii) and (iv)].	NEUTRALUnknown Confidence
Based on the offeror?s performance record, substantial doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Changes to the offeror?s existing processes may be necessary in order to achieve contract requirements.	MARGINALLittle Confidence
Based on the offeror?s performance record, extreme doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. 	UNACCEPTABLENo Confidence

	Price Criteria:

    	Proposals shall be evaluated, for award purposes, based upon the total price proposed for basic requirements (base period) and all subsequent option periods.

 	Offers for award purposes will be accomplished by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise such options.

                Unrealistically low or materially unbalanced offers, initially or subsequently, may be rejected or eliminated from competition either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or the offeror has made an unrealistic proposal.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to respond to bidders questions regarding the fire-suppression system and incorporate a bid requirement for fire-suppression, and provide information regarding bid opening attendance. (A) In response to bidders questions regarding the fire-suppresion system for Building 211: Yes, a fire suppression system is required by contract.  The contractor is required to provide a licensed fire-suppression system.  The Section 15300 of the specification was inadvertently omitted.  NIMA contacted the A&E firm to obtain a copy of the missing document.The piping section of the specification, Section 15300, is available and will be posted on the NIMA AC homepage at the following address:  http://www.nima.mil/poc/contracts/construct.html. However, the Government has identified flaws in the fire-suppression design information that cannot be rectified before bid opening.  As such, the entire fire-suppression specification is not available before bid opening.  To allow procurement to continue, each bidder shall include $100,000 in their bid price to cover the fire-suppression system.  The Government and bidders agree that this is not intended to be the final price for the fire-suppression system; rather it is intended to be a placeholder.  The final cost for the fire-suppression system will be negotiated and incorporated into the resultant contract award after contract award.  The intent of the $100,000 mandatory bid price is to ensure all bids are submitted on a fair and equal basis.  This $100,000 fire-suppression system cost shall be clearly identified in the bid  Not clearly identifying this cost may be cause for rejecting the bid. (B) Bid Opening - The bid opening remains unchanged: 2:00 p.m. on 12 September 02.  Bid Opening will be at National Imagery and Mapping Agency, Bethesda, MD.  Due to increased security procedures, bidders who will be attending the bid opening must submit their name (s) to Tamara Verdon, verdont@nima.mil., no later than 2:00 on September 10th.  Due to limited parking, request that each bidder organization bring only one vehicle.

Answer: 30 days 

Question 6: 
Are more details available on the courseware management module?

Answer:  No, just the basic description in the synopsis

Question 7: 
Will the firm fixed price award be based on 5500 seats? 

Answer: Yes 

Question 8: 
Are these 25 courses already created? If so, in what format are they in and are you looking for offeror to just transfer the content to a
web-enabled platform with a course management system running? 

Answer: No, the courses have not been created. The vendor is responsible for providing the entire course content.

Answer: Internet online training 

Question 13:

This is as opposed to total number of courses that will be taken as determined by number of employees by number of courses.

Answer:  No, contractor must develop and input the online training.

Question 21:

Answer: Courses should be completed by contractor and available to SSA no later than 30 days after the date of award.

Question 30:

Will this training be something that SSA could commit to nationally, or would we be interfacing with each locale or region? 

Answer: SSA is committing to this nationally. 

Question 36:

Answer: These will be needed.

Answer: 39: 
Contractor has all but 3 programs on the list. These could be ready to go within 6 months. Would that be sufficient? 

Answer: All Courses should be completed by contractor and available to SSA no later than 30 days after the date of award.

Question 40: 
What is meant by "allowing text to be edited"? Can you elaborate on that? 

Answer: Most off-the-shelf web based courses provide some guidance or instructions that are not applicable or suitable for our work environment. For example, while OSHA regulations allow some conditions or practices, our more stringent organizational standards may not. We also need the ability to provide SSA specifics on how and who should address various environmental health and safety concerns. Rather than provide conflicting or incomplete off the shelf training which may confuse the trainees or raise many questions from such a large audience, we need the ability to edit any text provided by the contractor.

Question 41: 
Does the instruction for Powered Industrial Vehicle course cover only Forklift Safety or are there other vehicle safety topics to be covered in this course? 

Answer: It should cover the proper operation of forklifts, platform lift trucks, tractors and motorized hand trucks in various workplace conditions where powered vehicles are used.

Likewise, does the Elevating Work Platforms pertain to Scaffold Safety or are there other topics that are to be covered in this course? 

Answer: Elevating work platforms include vehicle mounted elevating and rotating work platforms, self-propelled and boom-supported elevating work platforms. It should cover the operation and inspection of working platforms, recognition and preventive measures for safety risks, emergency action plan procedures, and personal fall arrest systems.

Question 43: 
Will the training platform be maintained on SSA servers or is the contractor to provide this service? 

Answer: Contractor provides this service 

Question 44: 
Is the Hazardous Waste Response module to be compliant with the HAZWOPER standard? If so what level of HAZWOPER training is required? 

Answer: It is meant to be an overview that trains participants to understand the risks associated with hazardous substances and how to recognize the presence of hazardous substances in the workplace, as well as how to notify the proper authorities in an emergency. 

Question 45: 
How soon after award is the contractor expected to deliver final product? 

Answer: Within 30 days of award 

Question 46: 
The SSA has requested that the modules allow for "text editing". How does the SSA reconcile the request for text editing capability while allowing the contractor to ensure compliance with health & safety regulations and ADA (e.g. preventing changes to required information, close-captioning of revised text, etc.)? 

Answer: SSA will edit any text it deems necessary, and contractor will make adjustments necessary to ensure compliance with ADA.

Question 47: 
What information is to be covered in the Environmental Awareness module? 

Answer: An overview of employees' environmental responsibilities that promote good environmental work practices. It should focus on prevention of air and water pollution as well as good work practices for solid waste disposal and spill prevention.

Question 48:
Are courses intended to fulfill training requirements of individual standards or to instruct health & safety personnel on the content and implementation of the standards? 

Answer: Courses are intended to educate personnel on the subject matter, including standards and implementation. 

Question 49: 
Is there a current company providing the web based training for the Social Security Administration?

Answer: Not applicable 

Question 51:

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS (SSS): Manufacturing Technical Assistance Procurement  Program (MTAPP)

BACKGROUND:  Midwest Manufacturing Technology Corporation (Mid Tec), located in St. Louis MO, was awarded a 5 yr. IDIQ pilot contract on 1 Apr 98 to identify and provide technical and manufacturing services to small business (SB) firms including women owned businesses (WOBs), historically underutilized businesses (HUBs), small disadvantaged businesses (SDB), etc., in the manufacturing industry. After identification of target firms, the contractor provides comprehensive business assessments (CBA) followed with continuous improvement plans, training, implementation, and creating virtual video tours through the firm?s facilities. The CBA is a critical process providing a thorough in-depth assessment of the firm?s business, financial, quality, and manufacturing processes.  The goal of the contract is to position the target firms to win USAF contracts. The pilot program contract will expire 1st quarter of CY 2003.

CURRENT SITUATION:  Mid Tec is providing manufacturing, business, and technical assistance to approximately 50 identified manufacturing firms. This pilot program is considered to be a success; therefore, the government is contemplating awarding a follow-on contract on a competitive basis.
Current estimate for the follow-on 5 yr. IDIQ contract is approximately 20 million dollars.

PURPOSE OF SSS: The government is doing market research to determine if sufficient qualified sources exist in the market place. The successful contractor shall have current and recent experience in providing CBA. The successful contractor shall also have experience in providing continuous improvement plans, training, implementation, and creation of virtual video tours through the target firm?s facilities.

SUBMITTAL:  When responding to this SSS, provide a 2-3 page narrative calling out your firm?s qualifications in terms of experience, proven successes, facilities, equipment, company owned and available training courses, and any other qualifications. Include a brief plan of how your company would accomplish a transition to the follow-on contract for the approximately 50 companies currently in the pilot program. In addition summarize the following: 1. Why your firm would not be viewed as in competition with the target firms; 2. State whether your firm would sign non-disclosure statements agreeing to confidentiality of all information received from target firms; 3. State whether your firm is a SB; specifically call out the type of SB; 4. State whether your firm is a not-for-profit organization or any other special category of firm; 5. State your past performance in government procurement processes and small business advocacy programs; 6.  State your firm?s experience with ?lean manufacturing? and ISO 9000 evaluation/implementation.  Based on a summary evaluation of the information provided, the government will notify each responder if they appear to be a potential contender for the eventual contract.   This summary evaluation in no way prohibits a contractor from responding to the future request for proposal (RFP).  Contractor should provide their response with full contact information by noon CST on 10 Sep 02 to the Contracting Officer, Mr. Joseph T. Beach, 311 HSW/PKOB, 210-536-6227, joe.beach@brooks.af.mil.  Electronic submission is encouraged.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT, A MARKET SURVEY FOR WRITTEN INFORMATION ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT OR ANY FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION REQUESTS.  NO TELEPHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED REQUESTING A BID PACKAGE OR SOLICITATION.  THERE IS NO BID PACKAGE OR SOLICITATION!  IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE PROCUREMENT INTEGRITY OF ANY FUTURE PROCUREMENT, IF ANY, THAT MAY ARISE FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, INFORMATION REGARDING THE TECHNICAL POINT OF CONTACT WILL NOT BE GIVEN AND NO APPOINTMENTS FOR PRESENTATIONS WILL BE MADE.
Cleaning solvents, such as P-D-680, based on paraffins, nathenes or aromatics are of environmental concern due to their volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and hazardous air pollutants (HAPS).   The Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center (NFESC), Port Hueneme, CA has been tasked to find new solvents that will meet the Navy?s shipyard and depot industrial cleaning operations.   A large cost saving will result from elimination of emission control equipment for low VOC solvents (<50 g/l).  Since 1993, alternative cleaning technologies have emerged to replace chlorinated hydrocarbon solvents, including aqueous cleaners, simi-aqueous cleaners, and solvents listed as Type IV (citrus terpenes for P-D-680 replacement).  DoD has increasingly come to rely on aqueous-alkaline cleaners for general industrial cleaning operations.  These alkaline cleaners provide substantial environmental benefits, but they can cause corrosion and hydrogen embrittlement of some metals surfaces such as copper, magnesium and silver plated steel.  Historically, non-chlorinated organic solvents, such as P-D-680, have been used to remove dirt, grease, soot, and burned-on carbon from various parts.  P-D-680 is a blend of petroleum distillates with a VOC content of ~800 g/l.  Although more environmentally friendly, the VOC content of terpenes is ~700g/l and unacceptable for large scale cleaning operations.  This Sources Sought is to determine if there are commercially available solvents that (1) do not contribute VOCs (< 50g/l), and (2) contain no HAPs).   After reviewing information obtained from this Sources Sought, NFESC will evaluate highly potential solvents for DoD material compatibility and performance criteria.   VOC emissions from industrial cleaning operations are regulated by local air districts regulation related to National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone.  Local regulations are more or less stringent depending on the attainment status of the air basin.  Non-attainment areas include large portions of California, Texas, and the East Coast from Virginia to Maine.  In addition to meeting future strict VOC requirements, it is equally important to that solvents be free of HAPs.  The new ?10?-year? National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs) are scheduled to be proposed by EPA in 2002.  The new rules that are of particular interest to DoD include the Miscellaneous Metals Parts and Products (MMPP) and NESHAP and the Plastic Parts and Products (PPP).   All proprietary information not to be disseminated in Government documents must be clearly identified.  Interested sources must submit their qualifications/capabilities in writing to NAVAL FACILITIES ENGINEERING COMMAND CONTRACTS OFFICE, CODE NF20 BLDG. 41, ATTN: N47408-02-SOLVENT, NAVFACENGCOMDET-NFI, 3502 GOODSPEED STREET, SUITE 2, PORT HUENEME, CA 93043-4306.  DEADLINE for receiving responses is September 30, 2002.  Responses received after the deadline or without the required information shall be considered unacceptable and will not be considered.  Since this is a sources sought announcement, no evaluation letters will be issued to the participants.

<DESC>Request for Information
Possible Guard Contract

This announcement constitutes a Request for Information (RFI) to be utilized in market research.  Information obtained as a result of this RFI is for planning purposes only.  It does not constitute an invitation for sealed bid or request for proposal (RFP), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The United States Marshals Service (USMS)/Justice Prisoner and Alien Transportation System (JPATS) is conducting market research for the purpose of investigating the possibility of awarding a guard contract to be used to provide guards for the transportation of federal prisoners and illegal aliens/detainees on its airlift.  JPATS supports the federal judiciary by scheduling and transporting prisoners to court and detention facilities around the country.  JPATS also transports illegal aliens to criminal and administrative hearings, court appearances and detention facilities, for the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS).  JPATS also provides regular international flights for the removal of deportable aliens.  Additionally, JPATS transports some non-federal prisoners for state and local law enforcement agencies.  JPATS seeks the potential services of the private sector to provide qualified individuals to assist in this effort.  The locations for these services are Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, Alexandria, Louisiana, and Mesa, Arizona.  The contractor must provide for coverage 7 days a week 24 hours a day at all sites for on site hangar security.  The Arizona, Louisiana and Oklahoma offices also require two back end crews daily, working on board aircraft.  The contractor will be responsible for having approximately 140 guards at the Arizona, Louisiana, and Oklahoma sites to support hangar security, backend aircraft security, and the Federal Transfer Center (FTC).  These crews fly daily and must arrive at the site ready to perform.  There is minimal lead-time and missions can be cancelled at the last minute.    Each guard would be responsible for assisting Aviation Enforcement Officers (AEO), Deputy United States Marshals (DUSM), Immigration and Naturalization Service Detention Enforcement Officers (INS/DEO) and Bureau of Prisons (BOP) Officers in the secure custody of any prisoner/alien/inmate from the time the detainee is accepted into the custody of JPATS and until the detainee is properly removed from the custody of JPATS.  "Secure custody" of a prisoner/alien/detainee means that the contractor can physically control the prisoner in the event of an attempted escape.  The guards may have to carry firearms and other tactical equipment in order to carry out his/her duties.  There is significant travel associated with this position.  It is possible that the guard will have to remain overnight in a location with little or no advance notification.  The contractor shall be responsible for arranging overnight lodging when it occurs, but will be reimbursed for the travel expenses in accordance with the Government Travel Regulations.  The contractor must prequalify potential guards to ensure they meet minimum qualifications for background investigations and medical clearance.  All guards must have completed an approved, certified flight safety training program and must undergo a medical examination.  The contractor shall be responsible for providing all uniforms, which meet JPATS specifications.  Additionally, the contractor will be responsible for providing all necessary training, passports, vaccinations, flight physicals, supervision, transportation, equipment, and all human resources support.  It is requested that interested offerors provide the Government with estimated hourly costs based on the information provided above.  Industry responses to the RFI should be submitted to the Contracting Officer no later than 30 calendar days following publication of the notice in the FedBizOps.  This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not constitute a request for proposal.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this RFI and the Government's use of such information.  Respondents to this RFI may be requested to provide additional information/details based on their initial submission.

Segment 3 shall be an average of 3 feet.  Segments must provide access to the overwing fairing area while engine panels are swung open.  Each segment will be capable of holding a minimum of 700 lbs.  Workers shall be able to move from segment to segment without dismounting.  Each segment shall have collapsible handrails for fall protection.  And allow the wings to be sweep after lowering handrails. There will be toe-boards a minimum of 4 inches high surrounding the work decks to prevent small items from rolling off or being kicked over the edge.  The interface edge between the aircraft and the work deck/toe-boards will be covered in a non-marking rubber bumper to prevent damage to the aircraft skin.  Each side of the aircraft shall have access to a stairway going from ground level to the work deck.  Each segments edges shall be painted yellow for protection.

Access stairs shall allow for treads to remain in the horizontal position when the deck height is raised or lowered.  Each stair shall have handrails fitted to each side.

<DESC>Quotes MUST BE SUBMITTED TO: NOAA/OFA64, 8455 Colesville Rd., Suite 1450, Attn: Jay Moore, Silver Spring, MD 20910. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is being conducted in accordance with the Public Law 103-355 (41 U.S.C. 264 note), and the information below is expressed as a statement of need for a commercial item, as outlined in FAR 12.202.  This acquisition will be procured IAW the simplified acquisition procedures outlined in FAR 13.106.  The intent of this synopsis is also to describe the required commercial items through the process described in FAR subpart 11.002.  Additionally, it is the intent of NOAA to tailor the provision of FAR 52.212-1 and 52.212-4 to include addenda to the terms, estimated to include inspection and acceptance provisions-if applicable to commercial practices.  In all instances wherein this text is supplemented by a "tailored" clause, the tailored clause shall take precedence over the corresponding text. Clause 52.212-4 (c), entitled "Changes" is hereby tailored by being supplemented by FAR clause 52.243-1-Changes-Fixed Price (AUG 1987), Alternate I (APR 1984).  
FAR 52.212-2 will be used for evaluation purposes, and will be supplemented by Factors (a), (b), and (c), below.  This Request for Quote (RFQ) states the requirements for providing 30 replacement bit synchronizers (RBS) for the existing Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite (POES) ground system, and for the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP), both operated by NOAA at its CDA facilities in Fairbanks, AK, Suitland, MD and Wallops, VA. The CDA stations use bit synchronizers as part of their 13- meter antenna data acquisition equipment. However, the CDA 13-meter DSI Model 7715 bit synchronizer manufacturer is no longer in business and support for the existing bit synchronizers is uncertain. This RFQ shall provide up to 30 drop-in replacement RBS units, in accordance with the specifications below. Evaluation criteria used for the determination of technical suitability is compliance with the specification for the RBS. Compliance is necessary for a favorable award determination.  Therefore, the Government will evaluate: (a) the Offeror's compliance with these specifications. Offerors must demonstrate through a compliance matrix that they either comply or take exception to the specified requirements herein. Use of appropriate commercial literature is acceptable in tandem with the compliance matrix.
