Lockheed Martin is the design agent, system integrator and the NAVSEA approved source of supply and certified depot for the AN/UYQ-70(V) weapon system. NAVSUP WSS does not possess the necessary engineering drawing masters, developmental specifications, engineering change data, interface specifications,
etc. required to source these parts to another vendor other than Lockheed Martin. NAVSUP WSS does not have required Navy technical support activity (TSA) or in-service engineering support approval to parts procured or repaired by sources other than Lockheed Martin. Data is not currently available for competition. Lockheed Martin provided detailed analysis and justification for value-added parts which was reviewed by the AN/UYQ-70(V) host ISEA community. This review was performed to see if parts could be properly broken out without negatively impacting host weapon system certification, configuration management and operating systems. The review revealed that the Government does not possess the in-depth technical knowledge; or the required technical documentation; or it

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) seeks information on a Reconfigurable Industrial Control Systems Cyber-Security Testbed. After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed, and specifications developed, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is in the process of developing a cybersecurity test bed for industrial control systems. The goal of this system is to measure the performance of industrial control systems when instrumented with cyber-security protections in accordance with best practices prescribed by national and international standards and guidelines. Examples of such standards and guidelines include IEC-62443 and NIST-800-82. The testbed will include a variety of industrial control simulation scenarios. The first of the scenarios will entail the simulation of a well-known chemical process called the Tennessee Eastman (TE) problem. The TE problem is an ideal candidate for cyber-security investigation because it is an open-loop unstable process that requires closed-loop supervision to maintain process stability and optimize operating costs.</p>
<p>The draft Specifications are attached. NIST is seeking responses from vendors that can satisfy these requirements.</p>
<p>NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334513, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less. Please include your company's size classification and socio-economic status in any response to this notice.</p>
<p>Companies that can provide the items required are requested to email a detailed response describing their abilities, and addressing the requirements set forth herein, to divya.soni @nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice. The response should include achievable specifications and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities. Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice: 1. Name of the company that manufactures the system for which specifications are provided. 2. Name of company(ies) that are authorized to sell the system, their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address). 3. Indication of number of days, after receipt of order that is typical for delivery of such a system. 4. Indication of whether each instrument for specifications are currently on one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s). 5. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in developing its minimum specifications and finalizing its market research.</p>

<p>Contract Type: Commercial Item-Firm Fixed Price. <br /><br />Part I: General Information</p>
<p>Introduction:<br />The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR), Division of Bioinformatics &amp; Biostatistics requires services to support the Government's requirement for Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) Toxicity Services for Biomarker Development with one Option Year.</p>
<p>Background:<br />The objective of LTKB analysis is to develop content-rich resources to improve the understanding of liver toxicity at the mechanistic level, thereby providing a valuable information for scientific researchers, the pharmaceutical industry, and regulatory bodies. This project involves the collection of diverse data (e.g., DILI mechanisms, drug metabolism, histopathology, therapeutic use, targets, side effects, etc.) associated with individual drugs, and the use of systems biology analysis to integrate the data for DILI assessment and prediction. Importantly, both conventional and high-throughput molecular biomarker assays will be conducted for selected drugs to develop novel biomarkers based on knowledge accumulated from this project.</p>
<p>Scope and Objectives:<br />The scope of the overall project consists of three phases (1) collecting diverse data (e.g., DILI mechanisms, drug metabolism, histopathology, therapeutic use, targets, side effects, etc) associated with individual drugs; (2) applying systems biology and network pharmacology approaches to integrate these data for DILI assessment and prediction; and (3) verifying the results using conventional and high-throughput molecular biomarker assays for selected drugs to develop novel biomarkers.<br />The scope of this specific requirement addresses phase three of the above stated project, which consists of contractor verification of results using conventional and high-throughput molecular biomarker assays for selected drugs to develop novel biomarkers. The objective of this requirement is to 1) Evaluate the severe DILI prediction potential of in vitro human hepatocyte assayed with 4 end points and 2) Develop a dose-response relationship of tested drugs for a quantitative measure of drug toxicity and rank order the severe DILI drugs.<br /><br />Part II: Requirements<br /><br />A. Overall Project Management <br /><br />The Contractor shall provide overall project management to insure that the scope, schedule, and cost of project are controlled and consistent with this contract.<br /><br />B. Responsibilities<br /><br />Within 30-days of contract award, the FDA will provide the stock solution of 200 drugs with identities blinded for the contractor for testing.<br />The contractor shall produce validation reports inclusive of reference range (10 donors), intra- and inter- plate variability, assay robustness, reagent stability, and run-to-run reproducibility. The contractor shall provide Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) describing the experiment procedure, including the standardized assay protocol, and reagent and sample storage conditions on the proposed assays, to maintain the raw data generated from the assays for auditing and to communicate any obstacles and problems for the completion of this contract. The reports shall be sent to the Government within 90-days of receipt of the stock solutions, and all reports shall be in Microsoft (MS) Word and Excel formats and emailed to a FDA point of contact (to be determined upon contract award). The contractor shall furthermore conduct teleconferences with the appointed FDA scientist(s) to discuss the research findings and related data as appropriate.<br />Upon key break with data analysis complete, the FDA will share, via email and teleconference, the results with the contractor of the identities and annotated information of the tested drugs, within 45-days of receipt and analysis of the raw data.<br /><br />C. Deliverables<br /><br />&bull; Cryopreserved human hepatocytes from 10 donors with 85% viability and 3D spheroid culture as well as hepatocyte co-cultures<br />&bull; Raw data generated from 4 assays performed on pooled hepatocytes with 7 concentrations, two time points and technical duplicates<br />&bull; Quality RNA samples (1ug of RNA per sample, and RIN (RNA Integrity Number) &gt; 8 and the 28S/18S ratio &gt; 0.9) produced from selected drugs enough for next-generation sequencing, with qrtPCR for the candidate genes on purified mRNA<br /><br /><br />Part III.

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c) (1) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<p><strong>PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT </strong></p>
<p>Wage Determination Monmouth, NJ WD 05-2351 (Rev.-13) was first posted on www.wdol.gov on 08/05/2014 is applicable to this service.</p>
<p>Location: Military Sealift Command Training Center East<br />1029 Route 33 East<br />Freehold, New Jersey 07728<br />Tel: (732) 938-4979<br />Fax: (732) 039-4615</p>
<p>Hours of fire extinguisher pick up and delivery are between 8:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. Monday to Friday, local New Jersey time.</p>
<p>1) General Statement:<br />During the course of basic and advanced fire fighting training conducted at the MSC Training Center East, each student is required to handle and discharge 15 lb. portable carbon Dioxide (CO2) fire extinguishers and 20 lb. ABC Dry Chemical extinguishers during their practical assessments. The number of extinguishers discharged varies widely based on the proficiency of each student, the number of students in each class and the total number of classes in a year.</p>
<p>This Statement of Work is for expended training CO2 and ABC Dry Chemical extinguisher inspection and refill, including round trip handling fees between the MSC TC-East and the vendor's facility.</p>
<p>2) Contract Requirements<br />The inspection procedure is broken down as follows:<br />1) Upon receipt at vendor facility, each CO2 cylinder is inspected to verify whether or not it requires hydrostatic testing. If the cylinder is out of date, hydrostatic testing is performed. If the cylinder passes, it continues through the inspection and refill process. If the cylinder fails hydrostatic testing it is condemned and removed from service (TC-E notified).<br />2) Cylinders which pass Hydrostatic testing are then inspected for functionality of the discharge valve assembly. If the discharge valve assembly is intact and operating properly, the cylinder is then recharged with CO2. If the discharge valve assembly is damaged or inoperable, the valve and associated seals/consumables are replaced prior to the cylinder being recharged with CO2.<br />3) Once each cylinder is recharged with CO2, the cylinder is inspected to see if the discharge safety pin and/or lanyard are still in place. If the pin has been retained, it is reinserted into the discharge valve handle to prevent accidental discharge and secured with a plastic seal indicating the unit recharge is complete and the unit is ready for service. If the safety pin and/or lanyard are missing, a new safety pin and/or lanyard are installed and sealed indicating that the recharge is complete and the unit is ready for service.<br />4) Regarding the recharge of the 20 lb. ABC Dry Chemical extinguishers, the process outlined above would remain the same with the only variation being the cost of the recharge of ABC agent vice the cost of CO2.</p>

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".<br />"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes.

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c) (1) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>

<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c) (1) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level.
