<p>Description: The ITEM DESCRIPTION is: The compressor stator front case assembly consists of the following components</p>
<p>(1) Compressor stator front case halves (2) Six stages of vanes with shrouds (IGV through stage 5) and five stages with seals (stages 1 through 5) (3) Five stages of removable rub liners (4) Stage 5 bleed air manifolds (5) Four stages of vane actuation rings The compressor stator front case is split into upper and lower halves, which are joined by bolted horizontal flanges. This allows for removal of upper stator only for access to compressor rotor for blade replacement. The compressor stator case lower half has borescope ports at stage 4 and stage 8 for installed engine inspection.</p>
<p>There are four stages of variable vanes: inlet guide vanes (IGV), stage 1, 2, and 3 vanes. These vanes have removable shrouds and seals. There are two stages of fixed vanes, stages 4 and 5.</p>
<p>These vanes are in multiple vane sectors, which slide into circumferential slots in case. These stages have removable inner seals and retainers. Bleed air manifold castings are bolted to casing aft of stage 5 vanes. Stage 5 compressor air travels from flowpath into a forward manifold for use as low pressure turbine (LPT) cooling air, and into a larger aft manifold for use as customer bleed and engine anti-icing air. This aft manifold has pressure-operated valves to prevent reverse flow of bleed air. The FUNCTION is Direct airflow at optimal angles onto the stages of Blades that immediately follow each vane sector. The variable vanes also assist in reducing compressor stalls. The DIMENSIONS are: Nominal diameter is 36.00 inches Height ~36.00 inches Weight ~ 90.0 lbs The MATERIAL consists of titanium.</p>

<a href="mailto:sharonda.davis@faa.gov">sharonda.davis@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>Market Survey for Strategic Sourcing of Various Supplies and Equipment (SAVES) Office Supplies
This is a market survey for the above identified requirements. This market survey is being released in accordance with FAA A.M.S. policy 3.2.1.2.1. The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only, and will not be released. Proprietary information will be protected if appropriately marked. This announcement is not intended to guarantee procurement of a product, and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal.  This is not a screening information request (SIR) or request for proposal (RFP).  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. 

In 2006 the FAA embarked on an agency-wide strategic sourcing/cost reduction initiative called SAVES (Strategic Sourcing for the Acquisition of Various Equipment and Supplies).  The FAA has since awarded competitively individual contracts for office supplies, office equipment, IT hardware, and courier services.  The office supplies contract is now nearing the end of its performance period.
This market survey is for the office supply category only.  Based on this analysis, the FAA may solicit a new procurement contract.  
The FAA anticipates the release of a Screening Information Request (SIR) for office supplies in December 2008.  We may choose to utilize the latest electronic processes for online bidding & proposal receipt for the commodity SIR as appropriate. Additional information and instructions will be included in the SIR.   
The Statement of Work (SOW) for office supplies is attached.  The functions identified therein are to be continued throughout the period of performance of the procurement.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is (453210) Office Supplies and Stationery Stores.
We are requesting information to aid the FAA in its determination as to whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition amongst eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program (small businesses 8(a) certified and other small businesses) or whether it is more appropriate to conduct this procurement as a full and open competition.
In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following information from interested vendors:
(I)	Ability One (Formerly JWOD)a)	Is your firm currently listed on the General Service Administration's Federal Supply Schedule 75, SIN 75 200?b)	Is your firm a certified Ability One (formerly Javits-Wagner-O'Day JWOD) distributor? c)	Does your firm distribute full a range of Ability One (JWOD) products?  If no, please explain.d)	Is your firm capable of substituting Ability One (JWOD) products that are essentially the same as commercial products?  If yes, please explain.
(II)	Internet Capabilitiesa)	Does your firm currently have secure internet capabilities? b)	Is your firm capable of providing an internet based web portal for use by the FAA?  If so, is this an existing website requiring customization or will it need to be developed specifically for the FAA.c)	Can orders be placed, tracked, etc. via your firm's internet site?
(III)	Supply Capabilitiesa)	Does your firm currently have a contract with another agency of the Federal Government?  If yes, please provide name of agency supported and type of contract.b)	Does your firm supply a full range of "core" office supplies as defined in the Statement of Work?  If not, please explain.c)	Does your firm supply a full range of "non-core" office supplies as defined in the Statement of Work?  If not, please explain.d)	Can your firm supply just toner, paper or general office supplies?e)	Can your firm supply original equipment manufacturer (OEM) as well as remanufactured products?f)	Can your firm deliver to the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia?
(IV) Pricing (Please note that the FAA is not asking for quotations or specific pricing information at this time)	
a)	The following describes the pricing structure for the FAA's current requirement.  Is your firm able to provide a pricing structure for products, similar to the pricing structure noted below?i.	Fixed Item Pricing - The FAA's market basket consists of approximately 1,200 fixed price items that represent 80% of the FAA's annual office supply expenditures.ii.	Category pricing - The remaining 20% are priced at category discounts.b)	Based on the pricing structure provided above, is your firm able to provide pricing to the FAA at a discount from your commercial internet price?  If a commercial internet price schedule is not available, how would you price to the FAA?
(V)	Environmentala)	Is your firm capable of providing products that conform to the Environmental Protection Agency's Comprehensive Procurement Guidelines?  If yes, please explain.b)	Is your firm capable of providing energy producing products qualified through the Electronics Products Environmental Assessment Tool?  If yes, please explain.c)	Summarized reporting of environmental products by category (i.e. recyclable vs. non-recyclable products)
(VI)	Approach a)	If respondent is an eligible 8(a) certified business or other small business, provide a strategy in terms of percentage of work to be completed by the 8(a) or small business respondent. (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.)b)	Complete the attached Business Declaration form.  If applicable, attach copy(ies) of the interested vendor(s) 8(a) Certification Form(s).  This shall include all necessary signatures and expiration date.
A vendor's failure to respond to this market survey does not necessitate that vendor's exclusion from the competition.  However, the failure of adequate and appropriate 8(a) business or small business participation in this market survey will result in a full and open competition.
Interested companies can register to be notified for future announcements related to this and all other posted FAA procurements by visiting the FAA Website address: http://faaco.faa.gov, which is the FAA "Contract Opportunities" site.  Should you want the e-mail automatic notification of FAA opportunities you may look under the column "Main Menu" and click on e-Mail Auto-Notify System.

No collect calls or telephone inquiries will be accepted.  This is an informational announcement. No solicitation exists; therefore do not request a copy of the solicitation.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The solicitation cited above can only be obtained by accessing a secure website known as the Federal Business Opportunity at https://www.fbo.gov.  FedBizzOpps is a secure website designed to safeguard sensitive but unclassified (SBU) acquisition information. It is fully integrated with other electronic government initiatives such as the Central Contract Registration (CCR) database, and is available for use by all Federal agencies.  In order to obtain information from FedBizzOpps, you will first be required to register with CCR.  The Central Contractor Registration database is a part of the Business Partner Network, an e-gov initiative, and will be used to validate vendor identity.  Effective October, 1, 2003, all government contractors must be registered in CCR prior to receiving an award.  You may access CCR at the following URL www.bpn.gov.   Once you have registered with CCR you will be required to register with FBO OPPS.  No via the following URL https://www.fbo.gov .  You will then be required to access the vendor registration form by selecting the hyperlink entitled Register with FedBizzOpps and then choosing the Vendor Registration Form hyperlink.  At a minimum all vendors must supply the following information:  (Your Companys Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) (You can get this from your Companys, CCR Point of Contact) your Companys DUNS Number or CAGE Code (Contact Dun & Bradstreet at 1-800-333-0505 if you do not have a D&B Number), your telephone number, and your e-mail address.  Effective January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. Any questions regarding this notification should be directed to the Contracting Officer or Contract Specialist whose name appears herein.  Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading the solicitation and monitoring the website for amendments if any to the solicitation.

Unlisted classifications needed for work not included within
the scope of the classifications listed may be added after
award only as provided in the labor standards contract clauses
(29CFR 5.5 (a) (1) (ii)).

In the listing above, the "SU" designation means that rates
listed under the identifier do not reflect collectively

----------------------------------------------------------------

                   WAGE DETERMINATION APPEALS PROCESS

1.) Has there been an initial decision in the matter? This can
be:

*  an existing published wage determination
*  a survey underlying a wage determination
*  a Wage and Hour Division letter setting forth a position on
   a wage determination matter
*  a conformance (additional classification and rate) ruling

On survey related matters, initial contact, including requests
for summaries of surveys, should be with the Wage and Hour
Regional Office for the area in which the survey was conducted
because those Regional Offices have responsibility for the
Davis-Bacon survey program. If the response from this initial
contact is not satisfactory, then the process described in 2.)

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System intends to award a sole source contract to Data Sciences International (DSI), 119  - 14th Street NW, St. Paul, MN 55112 USA; a division of Transoma Medical Inc. for the purchase of a DSI eight mouse blood pressure telemetry system.  This comprehensive data acquisition system is comprised of eight plastic cages, sensors, power supplies, data management computer, custom software, implant devices, small animal transmitters and other related components.To support needed requirements, this equipment will be used to measure the blood pressure of rats and mice.  The DSI system proprietary equipment includes: a specially designed pressure transmission catheter transfers pressure from the tip of the catheter to a pressure sensor located in the transmitter body.  Examples of pressures measured with PhysioTel PA series transmitters include arterial, ocular, uterine, penile, bladder, pleural and left ventricular. Other parameter data such as heart rate, systolic, diastolic and mean pressure can also be collected.  It is our understanding, DSI is the only manufacturer that produces this research equipment telemetry system.DSI implantable telemetry transmitters have been, and continue to be, used in studies involving mice such as telemetric recordings of sleep and home cage activity, abnormal heart rate and body temperature in mice lacking thyroid hormone receptor x1, the effects of triiodothyronine on heart rate, and numerous other studiesAll of DSI's PhysioTel Transmitters are implantable and capable of measuring activity.  The design of the transmitter shape allows for subcutaneous or intraperitoneal placement and PhysioTel transmitters can be re-sterilized between uses, extending their implant life and reducing costs.  This is only manufacturer for this implantable device.  The sole source acquisition is enacted in accordance with existing authority under FAR 6.302-1.The period of performance will begin on/after 15, October 2008.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes for this acquisition are 334516 with a small business size standard of $13.0 million dollars.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

The Primary Point of Contract for this project is Ms. Patricia Kelley, Contract Specialist, patricia.kelley4.@va.gov.  Telephone questions will not be answered. The Government reserves the right to use only the Internet as notification of any amendments to this solicitation. It is the offerors responsibility to view the FedBizOps website daily for amendments to the solicitation. This is a competitive negotiated acquisition using source selection procedures. The Government intends to use the trade-off process in selecting the prime contractor. The trade-off process is a method of evaluating both the technical factors specified in the solicitation and the price.  The object is to select the proposal that offers best value. The RFP will consist of two packages to be submitted at the same time; a technical proposal and a price proposal. The elements that make up the technical evaluation factors, in order of importance, are (1) Past Performance of the Firm (2) Experience and Qualifications of Key Personnel. Proposals will first be ranked according their technical quality. Price proposal packages of offerors will then be evaluated. Price and technical are equal in importance.  The Government may proceed with the award of the contract without discussion. However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected for contract award and may discuss proposals with the offerors. If discussions are necessary, the Government will establish a competitive range.  As proposals become more equal in their technical merits, price then becomes more important. Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation, and provides the combination of technical qualifications and price that is the most advantageous to the Government.

<DESC>DISCLAIMER: This Sources Sought Notice is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposals (RFP), Invitation for Bid (IFB) or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any services. Responses to this Sources Sought Notice shall not serve as proposals, bids, or offers, which could be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. The Government reserves the right to determine how it should proceed as a result of this Notice.

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has established a need for data collection, aggregation, validation, storage, retrieval and reporting services for a distinct set of Credit Card data submitted periodically by federally regulated banks.  This effort is necessary in order to position the OCC to have comprehensive and reliable data that will allow for enhanced supervision of large banks, conducting systemic risk analysis, enhancing benchmarking and analytic capabilities, and making informed policy decisions. 

In order to facilitate this endeavor, the OCC is seeking industry sources with demonstrated capabilities to provide innovative solutions and approaches for achieving the requirements outlined in the attached DRAFT Performance Work Statement (PWS) and attachments. The DRAFT PWS in its current form provides respondents the minimum requirements of the OCC.  It is the OCCs intent to use the information gathered in response to this Sources Sought Notice to assist the Government in its market research to determine whether to, in accordance with applicable law, set- aside, restrict competition, or solicit offers from all responsible sources. Furthermore, the responses obtained will enable the OCC to refine the strategy for the development of this requirement in order to structure a program that will mitigate cost, schedule, and performance risks. 

To assist the OCC in identifying potential sources that possess the specific expertise, capabilities and experience to meet the requirements of the PWS, the attached Capabilities Questionnaire has been developed. Respondents to this notice shall provide a written capabilities statement, which includes and addresses the questions outlined in the questionnaire and any relevant information that specifically addresses the companys capabilities to provide the services outlined. Capabilities Statements shall be no longer than 12 pages. 
 
It is particularly important for the government to understand the cost model for an entity to provide the support as described in this Notice. Therefore, respondents are encouraged to provide cost estimate information for the requirements described. 

The Government believes industry feedback is important, and is receptive to any and all ideas from industry, which would result in limiting unnecessarily constraining requirements, realizing cost savings, or highlighting potential technical, or contractual problem areas associated with this effort. The Government reserves the right to reject in whole or in part, any industry input as a result of this Notice. 

Failure to provide sufficient documentation may result in the Government being unable to adequately assess your capabilities. When submitting responses, vendors shall clearly identify any information it considers sensitive or proprietary. All information received in response to this Notice that is marked proprietary will be handled accordingly. Responses to this Notice will not be returned. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated and incurred by submitting a response. Eligibility to participate in a future acquisition is not predicated on a response to this Notice. 

Please submit responses via email to Nellisha Ramdass, Contract Specialist, at Nellisha.Ramdass@occ.treas.gov no later than 4:00 P.M. EST on October 21, 20008. 
All inquires relating to this notice must be submitted via e-mail.

<DESC>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) intends to solicit proposals from qualified organizations having in-house capability to develop a valid and reliable, standardized instrument that measures the propensity to and severity of drug addiction. The instrument is expected to provide transformational, scientific, technical, and practical utility for addiction research through its capacity to quantify the likelihood of becoming addicted (propensity) and an objective measure of the extent to which addiction manifests once developed (severity).

This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of small businesses (e.g., 8(a), veteran-owned small businesses, services-disabled veteran owned small businesses, HUB Zone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and women-owned small businesses) having capability to demonstrate in-depth knowledge and expertise in the use, advantages, and disadvantages of structured assessment instruments (e.g., the Addiction Severity Index (ASI), the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI)) designed to measure substance use disorders. However, unique to this effort are required capabilities in, and in-depth knowledge of, the application and use of modern psychometric techniques (e.g., item response theory) and advances in technological approaches (e.g., computerized adaptive testing); assessment instruments and diagnostic classification systems; the breadth and depth of scientific literature on risk factors and vulnerabilities for substance abuse and dependence; and effective strategies for optimizing wide-scale adoption of assessment techniques across diverse population groups, including those who vary by age, race, ethnicity, gender, geographic location, cultural background, socioeconomic condition, sexual orientation, and religion.

This project is specifically for the development of a prototype instrument that fully exploits modern psychometric techniques and computerization technologies to measure the propensity to and severity of addiction. The prototype will undergo iterative and widespread pilot testing for, among other characteristics, its reliability, validity, administrative procedures, and adaptability. NIDA anticipates a separate project regarding modifications of the prototype instrument, which may include further developmental work, additional features, field deployment and testing, and adaptations for clinical practice.

Offerors must also have the capabilities and experience required for developing and submitting materials for the collection of information from more than nine individuals to the Office of Management and Budget for timely review and approval.

The established NAICS code is 541712.  Information sent should be relevant and specific in the technical area under consideration, on each of the following qualifications:  1) Experience: An outline of previous similar projects, specifically the techniques employed in the areas described above; 2) Personnel: Name, professional qualifications and specific; experience in the work requested and knowledge of, and experience in, the field of drug abuse research.  Also, we will consider appropriateness of professional and technical personnel classifications; 3) Facilities: Availability and description of dedicated laboratory space, facilities, and equipment required to conduct this type of work. Any other specific and relevant information about this particular area of procurement that would improve our consideration and evaluation of the information presented is desirable.  Organizations should demonstrate capability to administer and coordinate interrelated tasks in an effective and timely manner.  Documentation may include, but not be limited to, contracts both Government and commercial the organization performed, references, i.e., names, titles, telephone numbers and any other information serving to document the organizations capability, e.g., awards, commendations, etc.   

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS: This notice is for information and planning purposes only and does not commit the Government to any contractual agreement.  The Government does not intend to award a contract based on responses under this announcement nor otherwise pay for preparing any information sent for the Government's use.

Theobjective is to extend the performance period for four months. The current Contractor provides support for users and occupants of Ames Research Centerunder Business Operations and Technical Services (BOATS). The principal purpose of thiscontract is to provide a variety of professional and para-professional functions tovarious divisions at NASA-ARC.	 The Contractor provides support for scientific andtechnical information, including video, photo, publications, printing and libraryservices; human resource management and training; acquisitions; equal opportunity andaffirmative action; commercial technology; public affairs and education outreach; legaloffice; and related administrative programs.. This extension will allow for acontinuation of services to ensure program continuity and critical mission support andavoid significant technical impacts while a competitive follow-on acquisition iscompleted. The extension will extend the period of performance of the current contract, NNA04CA76C,value and extend the period of performance for a period of four months, from December 29,2008 through April 28, 2009. The current contractor, Planners Collaborative, Inc. isconsidered the only contractor that can meet ARCs needs given the short period ofperformance for the extension.

<DESC>The purpose of this contract action is to acquire contractor support for the quality measure development and maintenance life-cycle activities described in the Measure & Instrument Development and Support (MIDS) Umbrella Statement of Work (USOW).

Increasingly, high quality means care that is personalized, prevention-oriented, and patient-centered, based on evidence about the benefits and costs for each particular patient.
Large gaps exist between the CMS of high-quality care for every patient every time and what our health care system delivers. Therefore, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services have many important opportunities to help health professionals, patients, and all of the stakeholders in our health care system turn promising new ideas into action to close the quality gaps.

One way CMS will carry out its obligation to the Health Care System and its beneficiaries is through this Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for work to be performed by a Measure & Instrument Development and Support (MIDS) Contractor. This umbrella Statement of Work (SOW) encompasses all of the fundamental activities that may be required of a MIDS Contractor. However, no work will be performed on the umbrella SOW since individual Task Orders will be awarded under the IDIQ for specific requirements (refer to contract Section G - Contract Administration, for details on task ordering procedures).

Task Orders may be awarded by CMS or other government agencies identified herein for some or all of the activities identified in this umbrella SOW. For example: A Task Order may be issued for all, or in part, of the activities identified in this umbrella SOW under a Task Order SOW that may read The Contractor shall perform all of the requirements of the umbrella SOW as the maintainer of the Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS). Or, a Task Order may be issued for some of the activities, such as Coordinate with Post Acute Care MIDS Contractors to assure Congruent Measure Application. Each Task Order will contain an individual work statement for requirements to be performed that are within the scope of this umbrella SOW

As supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

This solicitation (SP4705-09-R-0001) incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-23, effective December 26, 2007.   This acquisition is unrestricted.  The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 493190 and the small business size standard is 23.5 million dollars. The award will be in accordance with FAR 6.1.

J6F must create daily, weekly and monthly data tapes of all files created on the HQC LAN. The value of the data being created, stored and utilized within the DLA HQ IT Services distributed computing environment is increasing rapidly as we rely on these technologies to fuel the day today operations of the Headquarters Defense Logistics Agency.  Loss of this data would have a major impact on the ability for us to support the War Fighters.  Therefore, it is imperative that backup copies of the data be created and stored at a location outside the agency.  The intention is to award a Firm Fixed Price Contract.  The period of performance is one (1) base year beginning October 27, 2008 with two (2) one (1) year options with the total life of the contract not exceeding 36 months.

The primary objective of the Off-Site Storage is to further ensure that essential information contained on the HQC LAN is recoverable in the event of a site disaster.  In order to provide assurance this media containing the system backups be removed from the building to a physically secure location that meets all Federal, DOD and GSA requirements.

All offerors wishing to submit a proposal subsequent to the solicitation described herein must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database as well as the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) database or risk their otherwise-timely proposal being considered non-responsive regardless of its completeness, timeliness or other salient considerations.

Evaluation of Commercial Items will be in accordance with FAR provision 52.212-2.  Proposals will be reviewed to determine which one represents the greatest value, price and other factors considered.  Award will not necessarily be made to the lowest priced offeror, but rather the one that offers the best value to the National Park Service in terms of the following evaluation criteria.  
Evaluation criteria are listed in descending order of importance.    1. Past Performance - Weight = 40 points	
Evaluation will be performed only for existing and prior contracts for work similar in nature and complexity to that required by the solicitation and will include the following:
A. Quality of Products and Services.  Demonstrated ability to perform sign fabrication, engineering, design, installation, and production services in accordance with required design specifications. Conformance to good standards of workmanship and quality control. (0-10)
B. Customer Satisfaction.  Satisfaction of end users with the completed signs and/or sign components. (0-10)
C. Timeliness of Performance.  Compliance with delivery schedules; reliability; and responsiveness to technical direction. (0-10)
D. Business Relations.  Effective management, ability to manage projects involving subcontracts, working relationship with the Contracting Officer and Contracting Officer's Representatives, reasonable/cooperative behavior, flexibility, effective contractor recommended solutions, businesslike concern for government interests, and provides current, accurate, and complete billings. (0-10)
2. Comprehensive Plan including Project Management - Weight = 30
Evaluation will be based on the adequacy and feasibility of the Comprehensive Plan including Project Management.  Special emphasis will be placed on the Project Manager, the techniques employed, and how well the technical and management approaches will ensure the quality, timeliness, and effectiveness of finished products.
3. Samples of Work - Weight = 20
Evaluation will be based on samples of work that demonstrate the ability of proposed personnel and subcontractors to manage and produce graphics and structures that are similar in design and function to signs and sign components to be fabricated as part of this contract.
Evaluation under this criteria will be completed in two steps resulting in two separate scores as follows:
A. Production of panels using aluminumB. Production of panels using porcelain
4. Personnel - Weight = 10
Evaluation will be based on the qualifications, education, knowledge, and work experience of all personnel, including subcontractors, proposed for use under the contract.  Special emphasis will be placed on personnel's training and/or experience in the fabrication of tactile graphics or similar types of fabrication.
Evaluation under this criteria will be completed in two steps resulting in two separate scores as follows:
A. Production of panels using aluminumB. Production of panels using porcelain
Award Criteria:	
The Government anticipates award of one firm-fixed-price contract resulting from this solicitation.  A contract will be made to that responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the government, cost or price and other factors considered. Technical quality, including past performance, will be considered more important than cost or price. Warranty information as well as life cycle cost considerations will be included in the best value determination.  
Evaluation of prices will be first based on the government's requirement as stated in Attachment A.4, Contract Pricing Form, containing aluminum pedestrian guide panels.  To the extent that the government can afford porcelain pedestrian guide panels as set forth within Attachment A.5, Contract Pricing Form for Optional Porcelain, these prices will be evaluated and considered. The price for the porcelain option must be within the government estimate at the conclusion of negotiations.
In the case of an offeror with respect to which there is no information on past contract performance, or with respect to which information on past contract performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on the factor of past contract performance. In other words, past performance will be treated as neutral. This will be accomplished by giving a new firm the average score of the other competing offeror's and evaluating the proposal in accordance with the other stated evaluation criteria, (FAR 15.608(2)(iii)).
While price will be a factor in the award decision, the award may not necessarily be made to that offeror submitting the lowest price. Likewise, award will not necessarily be made for technical capabilities that would appear to exceed those needed for the successful performance of the work. A thorough examination will be made to determine an offeror's adequate understanding of the Scope of Work related to proposal presentation, price (including materials) and other factors considered. The question to be decided in making the final selection will be whether proposals scoring better are worth the dollar difference (if any).
As proposals become more equal in their technical merit, the evaluated cost or price becomes more important. As the technical merit and the evaluated cost or price become essentially equal, other factors may become the determining factor.
The government will consider other factors, as listed below in descending order of importance, secondary to technical, geographical disbursement, and cost or price;
(1) HubZone small business concerns;(2) Small business concerns which are also minority owned and operated; (3) Women-owned firms; and(4) Service-disabled veteran-owned small business firms.
In addition to the evaluation of technical merit, the cost, or price, and other factors, the standards for determining an offeror's responsibility as set forth in FAR 9.104-1, will be examined and considered. Additional factors which are not specifically set forth in this solicitation, but which are prerequisites for award as implied by law, regulation or public policy will be considered in the determination of an offeror's acceptability.
Attachment A.12, Intention to Propose, should be submitted on or before October 30, 2008.  Attachment A.6, Past Performance Questionnaire, should be submitted on or before November 6, 2008.  Only Numbers I and II of the Past Performance Questionnaire should be filled out.  The government will obtain the past performance information from the references provided.  All proposals should be submitted in an original and four copies for receipt no later than 4:00 p.m., EST, November 13, 2008, and shall be clearly marked with Request for Proposal Number N1106090001.  Offerors are hereby notified that if your proposal is not received by the date and time and at the location specified in this announcement that it will be considered late as stated in FAR Part 52.212.1(f).  
Past performance information and proposals should be sent to the National Park Service; Harpers Ferry Center; Office of Acquisition Management; Attention: Melody Wolfe, Administrative Specialist; Request for Proposal Number N1106090001; P.O. Box 50; Harpers Ferry, West Virginia 25425-0050.  Proposals by telephone transmitted facsimile (fax) will not be accepted.  
The offeror agrees that the proposal is valid for a period of 90-days after the closing date.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.

Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011. Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit quotations that will be considered by the agency.

    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting more than 50 percent for at least 80 percent each place it appears.

    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliate. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).    
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.     (3) Certain transfers disregarded.

<DESC>The United States Coast Guard, Operation Systems Center, intends to award on a limited source basis, contracts with Globe Wireless, Foster City, CA and WLO Shipcom, Mobile, AL for message service from ships at sea to the Coast Guard Operations Systems Center in Kearneysville, West Virginia via Coast Guard paid circuits.  It is further intended to establish each contract for a base year (12 months), with 4 12-month options.  To compensate these public coast stations for the handling and delivery of AMVER messages, the Coast Guard will pay the radio stations directly for delivery of each AMVER message.  The Contractors will use delivery invoices to bill the Coast Guard for all AMVER messages electronically delivered.   It is believed that these 2 radio stations are the sole remaining Coast Station operators in the United States that operate the type of system needed by the Coast Guard.  There used to be many operators over the years; however, they have gone out of the business or been sold to these 2 remaining operators.  Many ships have other methods of communicating directly with whomever they want and do not need the middle man services provided by WLO and Globe.  Globe relays SITOR messages that are sent by participating vessels.  WLO Shipcom relays both Morse Code as well as SITORS.  WLO is the only coast station that relays Morse Code.  The Government intends to negotiate with only these 2 sources under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b).     The reason justifying this limited source procurement is that the Government believes that only these 2 responsible sources can furnish the services that will satisfy the Governments requirements.  Any firm that believes it can satisfy the services described above are encouraged to give written notification to the Contracting Officer.  Supporting evidence must be furnished, in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to satisfy the Coast Guards requirements.  All responses received by the close of business October 24, 2008 will be considered.  Any future action based on responses to this notice will be at the sole discretion of the Government.  Inquiries will only be accepted by E-mail.

<DESC>The purpose of this contract action is to acquire contractor support for the quality measure development and maintenance life-cycle activities described in the Measure & Instrument Development and Support (MIDS) Umbrella Statement of Work (USOW).

Increasingly, high quality means care that is personalized, prevention-oriented, and patient-centered, based on evidence about the benefits and costs for each particular patient.
Large gaps exist between the CMS of high-quality care for every patient every time and what our health care system delivers. Therefore, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services have many important opportunities to help health professionals, patients, and all of the stakeholders in our health care system turn promising new ideas into action to close the quality gaps.

One way CMS will carry out its obligation to the Health Care System and its beneficiaries is through this Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for work to be performed by a Measure & Instrument Development and Support (MIDS) Contractor. This umbrella Statement of Work (SOW) encompasses all of the fundamental activities that may be required of a MIDS Contractor. However, no work will be performed on the umbrella SOW since individual Task Orders will be awarded under the IDIQ for specific requirements.

                   WAGE DETERMINATION APPEALS PROCESS

1.) Has there been an initial decision in the matter? This can
be:

*  an existing published wage determination
*  a survey underlying a wage determination
*  a Wage and Hour Division letter setting forth a position on
   a wage determination matter
*  a conformance (additional classification and rate) ruling

On survey related matters, initial contact, including requests
for summaries of surveys, should be with the Wage and Hour
Regional Office for the area in which the survey was conducted
because those Regional Offices have responsibility for the
Davis-Bacon survey program. If the response from this initial
contact is not satisfactory, then the process described in 2.)
and 3.) should be followed.

With regard to any other matter not yet ripe for the formal
process described here, initial contact should be with the
Branch of Construction Wage Determinations.  Write to:

	Branch of Construction Wage Determinations
	Wage and Hour Division
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

2.) If the answer to the question in 1.) is yes, then an
interested party (those affected by the action) can request
review and reconsideration from the Wage and Hour Administrator
(See 29 CFR Part 1.8 and 29 CFR Part 7). Write to:

	Wage and Hour Administrator
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

The request should be accompanied by a full statement of the
interested party's position and by any information (wage
payment data, project description, area practice material,
etc.) that the requestor considers relevant to the issue.

3.) If the decision of the Administrator is not favorable, an
interested party may appeal directly to the Administrative
Review Board (formerly the Wage Appeals Board).  Write to:

	Administrative Review Board
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

4.) All decisions by the Administrative Review Board are final.

*  an existing published wage determination
*  a survey underlying a wage determination
*  a Wage and Hour Division letter setting forth a position on
   a wage determination matter
*  a conformance (additional classification and rate) ruling

On survey related matters, initial contact, including requests
for summaries of surveys, should be with the Wage and Hour
Regional Office for the area in which the survey was conducted
because those Regional Offices have responsibility for the
Davis-Bacon survey program. If the response from this initial
contact is not satisfactory, then the process described in 2.)
and 3.) should be followed.

With regard to any other matter not yet ripe for the formal
process described here, initial contact should be with the
Branch of Construction Wage Determinations.  Write to:

	Branch of Construction Wage Determinations
	Wage and Hour Division
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

2.) If the answer to the question in 1.) is yes, then an
interested party (those affected by the action) can request
review and reconsideration from the Wage and Hour Administrator
(See 29 CFR Part 1.8 and 29 CFR Part 7). Write to:

	Wage and Hour Administrator
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

The request should be accompanied by a full statement of the
interested party's position and by any information (wage
payment data, project description, area practice material,
etc.) that the requestor considers relevant to the issue.

3.) If the decision of the Administrator is not favorable, an
interested party may appeal directly to the Administrative
Review Board (formerly the Wage Appeals Board).  Write to:

	Administrative Review Board
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

4.) All decisions by the Administrative Review Board are final.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command will be soliciting a proposal a proposal for support of the F-18 aircraft systems Electronic Control Unit (ECU) Test Program Set (TPS).  Honeywell Incorporated was responsible for the design and development of the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) Test Program Set (TPS).  Part of the design effort included providing source data to the F-18 aircraft Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) (Boeing Company) which in turn was utilized to develop the ECU TPS.  Honeywell Incorporated will be solicited for this requirement via a stand alone contract.  This effort will include providing expert consultation services to the USN to improve the existing TPS, review of the existing TPS, comparison of the existing TPS to the OEM Acceptance Test Procedure (ATP), noting differences (test points, test point pass/fail criteria), noting any repeated or redundant test points in the TPS, analysis of the potential impacts of disregarding TPS test points, evaluation of the pass/fail criteria for test points analyzed, determination of whether the test points can be expanded (determine whether the troubleshooting can be improved to diagnose problems to a single card), understanding the problems with existing TPS, propose revisions to existing TPS and verifying the adequacy of any proposed fixes.  This requirement is restricted to Honeywell Incorporated, the designer, developer, and integrator of the Electronic Control Unit (ECU), because Honeywell Incorporated is the only source that possesses the required proprietary rights data and a nondisclosure agreement with the F-18 OEM that are necessary to redesign, re-develop and produce the required Intermediate level Peculiar Support Equipment (PSE).  Further, as the designer, developer, and integrator of the ECU, Honeywell developed the necessary TPS source data and is the only firm that possesses the detailed technical knowledge, engineering expertise, aircraft integration information, technical data, combined aircraft and PSE expertise, as well as the trained technical personnel to fully integrate the needed new test capability with the F-18 aircraft platform.  Honeywell Incorporated is considered to be the only source that is capable of providing the required range of integrated support.
