<DESC>The pre-solicitation number for utilities privatization at Edwards AFB is FA9301-10-R-0011.&nbsp; This is a pre-solicitation notice for the privatization of utility systems at Edwards AFB. A solicitation notice with all applicable attachments is to follow. The Contracting Office, Edwards AFB, California plans to offer the privatization of utility systems (electric, natural gas, water, and wastewater) at Edwards AFB, California located primarily within Kern County, approximately 100 miles northeast of Los Angeles, California. Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for environmental compliance, operation, maintenance, repair, future upgrades and future utility system replacements. The conveyance of the utility distribution systems is authorized and conducted under 10 USC 2688. The statute requires that privatization must reduce the Air Force's life-cycle costs for operating and maintaining utility systems and services. All privatization projects will be supported by an economic analysis based on accepted life-cycle costing procedures that demonstrate the long-term economic benefit and reduced long-term costs. If the economic analysis determines that privatization is uneconomical, a contract will not be awarded, and proposal costs will not be paid. The resulting contract(s), if awarded, will require the Contractor(s) to furnish all necessary labor, management, supervision, permits, equipment, supplies, materials, transportation and any other incidental services for the complete ownership, operation, maintenance, repair, upgrades and improvements to these utility systems. North American Industry Classification Codes of 221122 (Electric Power Distribution), 221210 (Natural Gas Distribution), 221310 (Water Supply Systems) and 221321 (Sewer Treatment Facilities) apply. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and its supplements apply to this procurement.
<p>The Contractor(s) will be required to manage, control and perform its operations, maintenance, repairs, replacements and incidentals of its utility system(s) to provide firm, reliable and dependable utility service to each Government or tenant connection within the service area 24 hours each and every day. The utility systems will be conveyed by way of a Bill of Sale upon award of contract(s) and real property interests will be granted in the form of a Right-of-Way. The Contractor(s) proposal and plans may become a part of the contract upon decision to award. The Government anticipates awarding a Fixed-Price with Prospective Price Redetermination Utility Services Contract(s) for a term of 50 years to the Best Value offeror(s). The ability to award individual systems to individual firms will exist. This requirement is unrestricted. All responsible sources may submit an offer that will be considered. To be eligible for award, a firm must be registered in the DOD Central Contractor Registration (CCR). You may register via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov . Large businesses are required to submit a subcontracting plan that meets the requirements of FAR 52.219-9. The request for proposal will be available by downloading from the FedBizOps Internet site-no paper copies or CD's will be provided. Interested parties are required to self-register their firm or office on the website. It is the proposer's responsibility to check the website for amendments and other information related to the request for proposal. Proposals shall be submitted by mail or hand carried in accordance with the time, date and location specified in Block 9 of the SF33. Questions on the RFP shall be submitted electronically to Aimee Buckless at email address: aimee.buckless@edwards.af.mil .

<DESC>Lab-Based Influenza Surveillance Program: The mission of the DoD Global Influenza Surveillance program at USAFSAM is to provide an operationally relevant, global, laboratory-based system of respiratory pathogen surveillance for the purposes of force health protection. The program's network of sentinel sites provides for base-level surveillance both within the continental U.S. and overseas. Overseas sites include military bases and DoD research facilities in locations not otherwise covered by current WHO influenza surveillance network. These locations include deployed sites in Central Asia and the Middle East, where new confirmed avian-to-human transmission is occurring with increased frequency. Information from influenza virus sequencing and overall world surveillance are essential for determining components in next year's influenza vaccine which benefits not only the US Armed Forces and Allies, but the civilian population as well.
<p>Food Vulnerability Assessments (FVA): The Epidemiology Consult Service (USAFSAM/PHR) provides consultant services relating to food defense issues at active duty, AF reserve and ANG bases, Major Commands and HQ Air Force, as well as Army, Navy, and Marine Corps units. USAFSAM/PHR's FVA team provides timely and accurate food defense consultative support. Team priorities include frequent travel as part of vulnerability assessments and responding to customer requests for food defense support services in a quick manner, and timely dissemination of accurate and useful assessment reports. Primary stakeholders are all levels of the USAF.</p>

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award on a sole source basis a contract to Fluoresentric, Inc., P.O. Box 982303, Park City, Utah. A contract shall be issued for Real-time PCR assays for botulinum toxin genes A through G. Justification for other than full and open competition is considered due to the fact that the PCR assays were developed by Fluoresentric and no other vendor can produce the assays since some of the primer and probe sequences are proprietary. No other alternatives are considered at this time because the assay cannot be reconstituted without certain proprietary components used by Fluoresentric. Note 22 applies herein. The statutory authority permitting other-than-full-and-open competition is 41 U.S.C., 253(c)(1): FAR 6.302-1. Only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract will be based on responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will be considered solely for informational purposes. This procurement is not set-aside for small business.

<DESC>The objective of the Transformer (TX) program is to demonstrate a four (4) person flyable/roadable vehicle that provides the warfighter terrain-independent mobility. This presents unprecedented capability to avoid traditional and asymmetrical threats while avoiding road obstructions. TX will enable enhanced company operations of future missions with applicable use in strike and raid, intervention, interdiction, insurgency/counterinsurgency, reconnaissance, medical evacuation and logistical supply. The TX vehicle will have Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) capability with a minimum combat range of 250nm on a single tank of fuel.
<p>The primary focus of the TX program will be the development and demonstration of an integrated suite of critical technologies that enable dual-mode transportation, VTOL capability, efficient flight performance, and a combat range comparable to today's rotorcraft. It is envisioned that this program will, at a minimum, demonstrate the ability to build a ground vehicle that is capable of configuring into a VTOL air vehicle that provides sufficient flight performance and range, while carrying a payload that is representative of four (4) troops with gear. Key performance parameters have been specified to show specific operational utility. The program will be divided into two separate tasks. Task A will develop and integrate a full vehicle and Task B will develop individual critical technologies components for the full vehicle.</p>

<DESC><p>The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) intends to award a sole source purchase order to the National Asphalt Pavement Association (NAPA) for co-sponsorship with FHWA of three regional conferences related to Warm Mix Asphalt (WMA), Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA), and recycling under the heading "Paying Smarter with Asphalt." The conferences are scheduled for May, September, and November 2010 in different regional areas of the United States. This sponsorship will maximize the delivery of innovative asphalt pavement technologies, including WMA and high percentage recycling and will facilitate critical partnerships necessary to assure a more efficient use of HMA materials through proper evaluation, mix design, and production practices. This is anticipated to be a simplified acquisition with an expected award the week of April 26th or May 3rd, 2010.<br /><br />NAPA has unique expertise and experience that make it the only organization capable of co-sponsoring these workshops in this specialized field. NAPA has developed a unique and innovative approach to showcasing HMA and WMA through conferences and workshops for all critical parts of the asphalt concrete community. Its marketing will attract a wide variety of stakeholders to the conferences due to its comprehensive network of domestic and international members and associates. High attendance, in terms of size and diversity, is critical to the success of these conferences. NAPA is the only professional asphalt concrete pavement organization in the United States which represents the entire asphalt pavement industry and is also capable and fully experienced at organizing and managing large workshops for domestic and international audiences.<br /><br />All responsible sources may submit a response identifying their interest and capability to respond to this requirement, which will be considered by FHWA. Information received by FHWA will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The proposed contract action is for services which FHWA intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulations 6.302-1 and 13.501. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.</p>

NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the services from Janet Chien, pursuant to FAR 13.106, forthe acquisition of supplies or services determined to be reasonably available from onlyone source. The software and techniques to validate both the regional and global productswere developed by Janet Chien.	It is  expeditious for her to continue assisting GSFCwith the validation.  Failure to do this will result in GSFC's inability to fulfill anagreement with the AFWA and jeopardize the Air Force's ability to get the blended snowproduct out for Air Force use by the winter of 2010-11.  Additionally, the time requiredto train a new individual would negatively affect GSFC in meeting the deadlines with theAFWA.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 6.302-1, with Advanced Cooling Technologies, Inc., of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, for the acquisition of two NA-20-12 UHT IFL Haynes 230/Sodium-filled Heat Pipes to replace the pipes currently being used as part of a furnace system used by NISTs Physics Laboratory. 

*** NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.
(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in --
(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or
(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).)

The Optical Technology Divison of NISTs Physics Laboratory currently utilizes two Advanced Cooling Technologies heat pipes in the existing furnace system in its laboratory.  Replacing the existing ACT heat pipes with new ACT pipes of identical dimensions will facilitate the transition of the furnace to a safer operating functionality without having to completely redesign the furnace, which was originally designed around the ACT heat pipes currently in place.  Redesigning the furnace to accommodate heat pipes from another manufacturer would be cost prohibitive.

Advanced Cooling Technologies, Inc. is the only contractor who can provide the NA-20-12 UHT IFL Haynes 230/Sodium-filled Heat Pipes that meet NISTs requirements.  Therefore, Advanced Cooling Technologies, Inc. is uniquely qualified to provide the required NA-20-12 UHT IFL Haynes 230/Sodium-filled Heat Pipes.

Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractors commercial schedule.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  The Government will consider responses received by 3:00 p.m. (EST) on March 19, 2010.  Inquiries will only be accepted via email to paula.wilkison@nist.gov.  No telephone requests will be honored.   

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.

<DESC>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Office of Acquisitions, Station Support Simplified Acquisitions Branch on behalf of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) plans to procure, on a non-competitive basis, an upgrade to the LEICA TCS SP5 Microscope with LEICA Microsystems Inc., 2345 Waukegan Rd, Bannockburn, IL 60015. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) and FAR 13.501 (a)(1) to use Simplified Acquisition Procedure for commercial items. The North American Industry Classification System Code for this acquisition is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.
<p>The NINDS Developmental Neurobiology Section (DNS) recently purchased a LEICA TCS SP5 Microscope that has both point and resonant scanning to visualize the activity of neurons labeled with calcium or voltage sensitive dyes. At the time of the purchase, NINDS/DNS with a limited budget could only afford a single objective (20X) and 2 visible lasers and could not afford to purchase a camera for widefield fluorescence imaging, the DeepSee precomp unit to minimize beam dispersion or the UV 405 and the 543nm HeNe lasers that are essential for 4-color fluorescent imaging, UV photolysis and Fura-2 calcium imaging. The NINDS/DNS is in need to upgrade the LEICA TCS SP5 microscope. The upgrade comprises a 6 (six) position nosepiece, 6 (six) objectives (3 dry, 3 water immersion), new UV and 543nm HeNe lasers and a camera. The objective nosepiece, the new lasers and the camera are all controlled by the Leica AF software that is part of the Leica TCS SP5 microscope system. Therefore, the upgrade to the LEICA TCS SP5 microscope can only be obtained from the manufacturer. The ongoing projects at NINDS are critical to the mission of the NINDS/DNS. To accomplish NINDS' mission and to keep the ongoing project running without further delay, it is important to the NINDS/DNS to upgrade the microscope system and to purchase the upgrade from LEICA.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Bethesda, Maryland and is required within 90 days after receipt of order.</p>

<CONTACT>Sen Sakamoto, Contracting Officer, Phone 011-81-176-64-3496, Fax 011-81-176-52-4793, Email sen.sakamoto.jp@misawa.af.mil
<DESC>This is a pre-solicitation notice for Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC), including Design-Build capability, at Misawa Air Base, Japan, with 1-year basic period plus four 1-year options, noting that this MACC was previously synopsized under RFP No. FA5205-09-R-0008 and renumbered to FA5205-10-R-0008 due to administrative matters. The MACC is a contract for execution of a broad range of maintenance, repair and minor construction and may include design-build capability. Contractors will be expected to accomplish a wide variety of individual construction tasks encompassing design-build, renovation, additions/upgrades, along with specific work such as, but not limited to, HVAC (heating, ventilation, air conditioning), electrical, mechanical, architectural, and other major trades. Description of the work will be identified in each individual task order. Individual task orders may be as low as Y1,000,000, or may be well in excess of Y100,000,000; however most task orders will fall in the range of Y5,000,000 to Y50,000,000 (Y stands for Japanese yen currency). The program value is Not-to-Exceed *$90 million for a five-year period (*or equivalent Yen amount converted by use of respective fiscal years' Foreign Currency Fluctuation Defense (FCFD) budget rate for Japanese Yen). The government may award multiple contracts up to five; however, the government reserves the right to award less than five. The multiple contract awards will be made to offerors who provide the Government with the best value, using Performance Price Tradeoff (PPT) process in accordance with AFFARS 5315, and Mandatory Procedure (MP) 5315.305, paragraphs 5.5.2 and 5.6.2.1., and Informational Guide (IG) 5315.101-1, with evaluation factors to be included in the RFP consisting of: Technical Acceptability including Seed Project, Past Performance, and Price of Seed Project. The RFP will include a seed project, and award of the seed project at the time of contract award will satisfy the guaranteed minimum/Y3,000,000 for the MACC. All other successful awardees not receiving award of seed project at the time of contract award are guaranteed a minimum of Y3,000,000. The government will compete future individual requirements among the awardees. The solicitation for MACC pre-announced here is expected to be issued on or after 27 Apr 10. The closing date and time for submission of offers as well as the date and time for pre-proposal conference will be contained in the solicitation package which will be made available only on Electronic Posting System (EPS) single government point of entry (GPE) Web Site at http://www.fedbizopps.gov at that time. Potential offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation package and any other pertinent information and for downloading their own copy of the solicitation package. Potential offerors MUST register at http://www.fedbizopps.gov in order to receive notification and/or changes to the solicitation. All contractors MUST be registered in the Central Contractor Registration database or their proposal will not be considered. Contractors can obtain further information on the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at web site http://www.ccr.gov.
<p>This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or multiple contracts nor does it obligate the Government to pay for any bid/proposal preparation costs.</p>
<p>NOTE: Since the contemplating contract is to be awarded by the contracting activity located in Japan and to be performed in Japan, the offerors must meet the following two requirements for OCONUS: (1) DFARS 252.225-7042, "Authorization to Perform" - The Offeror has been duly authorized to operate and to do business in the country or countries in which the contract is to be performed, and (2) FAR 52.236-7 (modified IAW AFFARS 5336.507), "Permits and Responsibilities" - The Contractor shall, without additional expense to the Government, be responsible for obtaining any necessary licenses and permits, and for complying with any host government and political subdivisions laws, codes, and regulations applicable to the performance of the work.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT WANTS TO LEASE OFFICE SPACE
IN LAKEWOOD, COLORADO (SFO# 8CO2358)

REQUIREMENT:
General Services Administration is interested in leasing office and related space consisting of approximately 38,180 rentable square feet, which will yield approximately 33,200 ANSI/BOMA occupiable square feet of office space for personnel, furnishings, and equipment.  The space will initially be occupied by the Department of the Interior - National Business Center.

LEASE TERM:
5 years, 29 months firm term (February 1, 2010 to June 30, 2012).

UNIQUE REQUIREMENTS:
Office space must be contiguous and have potential for efficient layout.  Space shall be located in a professional office setting.  The Government requires a fully serviced lease including 290 on-site parking spaces for employee and visitors.  Off-site parking may be considered subject to: distance from the offered building, offerors ownership or control of the parking area, and safe path of travel for employees and visitors as determined by the Contracting Officer.  The Government prefers the right to directly connect the newly-leased space with the existing NBC campus located at 7301 W. Mansfield Ave, Lakewood, CO 80235.  This would be accomplished by boring under the ground between the two properties to directly connect the IT and telephone systems. 

Space must be capable of being fully accessible to the physically handicapped, must meet minimum seismic requirements, and must not lie within a 100-year or 500-year flood plain or wetland unless the Government has determined it to be the only practicable alternative. The building will be subject to any and all other building or construction rules, regulations, laws and/or ordinances of the local, county, state and federal levels as they may apply.  All services, supplies, utilities, partitioning and tenant alterations are desired as part of the rental consideration.  The offered space must meet Government requirements for Fire and Life Safety and Handicapped Accessibility.   Occupancy is required February 1, 2010.

LOCATION:
Offered properties must be located within a 1/4 mile radius of 7301 W. Mansfield Ave., Lakewood, Colorado.  Only properties that are contained within these boundaries or which front directly on them and meet or are capable of meeting the above criteria will be considered for this procurement.

EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST MUST BE SUBMITTED IN WRITING AND INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION:
1)	Building name and address.
2)	Legal description.
3)	Scale drawing of space offered.
3)	Square footage offered.
4)	Description of parking availability with site plan.
5)	Method of measurement used to determine rentable square feet.
6)	Name, address, and telephone number of individual to be contacted.
7)	Evidence of authority to represent the owner.

AUTHORIZED CONTACTS:
In no event shall the Offeror enter into negotiations or discussions concerning the space to be leased with representatives of any Federal Agency other than the officers and employees of General Services Administration (GSA) or their authorized representative.

<DESC>The Samuel S. Stratton Veterans Affairs Medical Center (Hereafter "VA"), located at 113 Holland Ave., Albany NY 12208, plans to solicit the market and make competitive award of a Real Property Lease Agreement for approximately 500-600 gross square feet of office space located within 3 miles of local Plattsburgh Outpatient Clinic (80 Sharron Avenue Plattsburgh, New York 12901).The geographic limitations detailed above will be strictly enforced and the VA will not accept or consider offers from beyond its boundaries.The anticipated lease agreement would be for one year.The VA is willing to consider only standard fit-out ready stand-alone building or suite with active utility connections that can be modified to meet the general needs (i.e., a "warm, lit shell").  It is preferred that the structure/building already be existing.  The VA would be the sole occupant of this space once fit-out appropriately for its use.  The VA would anticipate amortizing the cost of any fit-out/construction into the monthly rental payments to be made to the lessor across the term of the lease.A beneficial occupancy date is required no later than May 15, 2010.  Evaluation will likely take into account whether the offered space could be made ready for VA use prior to that date.  Interested parties are required to send an email Sonja.Stroud@va.gov to request a market survey of their available property.  This email must be received no later than April 23, 2010.  The email must include a point of contact name, telephone number, email address, the physical address of the property, the available square footage, asking price (if available), and a general overview of the building's age, condition, prior/current use, and available utilities.  It is also encouraged that one submits a floor plan and pictures.Following April 23, the VA will begin the process of formal market surveys at each offered site.  This market survey will consist of a group of VA stakeholders visiting and evaluating each offered space to make a go/no-go determination of whether the space currently meets or can be made to meet the VA's needs.  These market surveys are anticipated to occur during standard business hours in the month of April, and will require the building owner or a designee pre-approved by the VA to be present.  Market surveys are typically 30 minutes to 90 minutes in length.Following market surveys, the VA will release a Solicitation for Offers (SFO) to owners of spaces which were rated as a "go" during the market survey.  This SFO will specify a time period in which offerors must prepare a full, signed lease offer and submit the offer to the VA for final evaluation.  The VA may conduct discussions (negotiations) as necessary with offerors to reach a final, best-value decision regarding the ultimate award of a lease.  However, the Contracting Officer may use FAR 15.306(d) (3) and choose to award without discussions.All correspondence regarding this synopsis, the resulting solicitation, and the ultimate award of this lease must be conducted exclusively with the Contracting Officer and/or a designee thereof.

<DESC><p>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE</p>
<p>SEROIMMUNITY TO POLIOMYELITIS IN THE US</p>
<p>SOURCES SOUGHT - MARKET RESEARCH NOTICE<br />Notice Number: 2010-N-12097 <br />Project Title: Seroimmunity to Poliomyelitis in the United States<br /><br />Background</p>
<p>Recent outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases for which indigenous elimination has occurred highlights the concern of potentially growing susceptible populations in the United States due to a lack of vaccination. The last indigenous case of poliomyelitis in the United States occurred in 1979; however the risk of importation from global endemic areas persists. The risk of transmission of poliovirus from an importation into a population is not known due, in part, to a lack of information regarding susceptible sub-populations in a community.</p>
<p>Epidemics of poliomyelitis due to the 3 types of poliovirus occurred prior to the advent of vaccine. In the United States, inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) was introduced in 1955 followed by a transition to oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) in the early 1960's. Utilization of these two vaccines led to a rapid decrease and eventual elimination of wild-type poliomyelitis. The Western Hemisphere was certified as free from indigenous wild poliovirus in 1994. In order to decrease the risk of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) associated with the use of OPV, the routine all-OPV schedule was replaced with a sequential IPV followed by OPV schedule in 1997. This was followed by an all-IPV schedule which has been routinely recommended since 2000. No OPV has been distributed in the United States since 1999.</p>
<p>The most recent serosurvey to evaluate immunity in the United States was done from 1997-2001 during the transition from OPV to IPV. This study was done in four urban areas in children aged 19-35 months and concluded that the transition to IPV did not negatively impact the seroprevalence of anti-poliovirus antibody in that age group (1). Previously, a serosurvey in two inner city populations during the all-OPV era among children age 12-47 months found that secondary OPV exposure played a modest role in providing seroprotection (2). A study of sera collected in 1966 and 1971 in the United States found that 1) the proportion of susceptibles was increased in older age groups; 2) susceptibility to type 3 poliovirus was highest; and 3) self-reported vaccine coverage was non-informative for predicting serologic immunity (3).</p>
<p>Serosurveys to evaluate population protection for poliomyelitis have been conducted in other countries without endemic disease. For countries utilizing OPV at the time of the surveys, lower levels of seroprotection to type 3 poliovirus was a consistent finding (4, 5, 6, 7, 8). While some studies found differences in seroprotection rates for some age cohorts, this was not a consistent finding and could vary depending on vaccine and disease history in the country evaluated. For IPV-only countries, GMT's generally were lower with time since last vaccination, but high protective antibody prevalence was found across ages (9, 10, 11).</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives</p>
<p>The gaps in knowledge regarding the U.S. population's susceptibility to poliomyelitis requires the following three questions be addressed:</p>
<p>1. Ten years from the transition from OPV to IPV, what is the seropositivity rate for the age cohort that has received IPV with no exposure to environmental OPV?</p>
<p>2. What are the seroimmunity profiles in other age cohorts who have different disease and vaccine exposures over time including 1) those vaccinated during the transition from OPV to IPV; 2) those vaccinated during the all-OPV era; and 3) those vaccinated in the early IPV era with a lower potency formulation and those mostly unvaccinated, both with potential wild-type poliovirus exposure.</p>
<p>3. In an all-IPV era, is there a growing immunity gap with increasing age potentially due to waning immunity potentially as a result of a lack of secondary OPV boosting?</p>
<p><br />Anticipated Performance Period</p>
<p>A cost reimbursement contract is anticipated with an award date on or about September 1, 2010 and a period of performance for six months. The associated NAICS code is 541712.</p>
<p>Capability Statement</p>
<p>CDC is interested in soliciting capability statements from all qualified Offerors demonstrating their ability to perform this research effort. At a minimum, Offerors must document capabilities in the following areas.</p>
<p><br />A. Access to clinical/hospital facilities with sufficient capacity to routinely acquire blood/serum samples from all age cohorts in the study with a demographic population base representative of the surrounding community. This would include a minimum of 1,000 outpatient visits for routine blood draws per month covering all age groups.</p>
<p>B. Ability to recruit sufficient number of participants for each study age cohort (100 persons in each of the following age cohorts: age 2-3 years; 6-10 years; 11-15 years; 16-50 years, &gt;50 years) within a 6 month time period.</p>
<p>C. Ability to have participants complete a brief (~2 page) questionnaire on demographic information as well as relevant vaccine and disease history and obtain informed consent.</p>
<p>D. Ability to obtain serologic specimens of 2-3mL in all age cohorts included in the study including ability to have adequate phlebotomy staffing and available supplies.</p>
<p>E. Ability to identify and recruit participants in sub-populations with lower vaccine coverage (&lt;85%) due to vaccine exemptions, particularly for the younger cohorts.</p>
<p>F. Documented experience in performing and participating in clinical trial studies. Special attention should be given to discussion of previous experience of a similar size and complexity to this project.</p>
<p>G. Adequate facilities to properly store, batch, and ship vaccine to CDC for analysis including documented cold-chain requirements and sample pedigree.</p>

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p>BACKGROUND The National Institute on Aging (NIA) supports through contracts several colonies of aged rats and mice for use in research on aging. Some investigators do not need live animals, but simply collect specific tissue from the animals for their experiments. To facilitate this need, the NIA has developed this contract is to provide a source of fresh-frozen tissue, suitable for multiple experimental protocols, from the NIA colonies of aged rats and mice. This will allow multiple investigators to make use of different tissues from the same animals, and will lower the cost of tissue for those investigators. This is a recompetition of NIA contract HHSN260200600004C.</p>
<p>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES The NIA is planning to procure services to provide a mechanism whereby investigators can purchase specific tissues from the animals in the NIA aged rodent colonies. The tissue will be unfixed and flash-frozen, rendering it suitable for most molecular biology protocols and many histological and cytochemical protocols. The Contractor shall be required to formalin- or ethanol-fix tissues and make tissue arrays to meet the specific needs of NIA funded investigators.</p>
<p>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS The Contractor shall receive mice and rats selected by the Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR) from the NIA colonies and shipped at no cost to the Contractor, and shall upon receipt of the animals assign an identification number to each animal, record vital statistics, and collect, flash-freeze, package, label and store tissues, and ship tissues to investigators at the direction of the COTR. The number of animals to be sent for tissue collection each year is dependent on need. It is estimated that 150 animals per year shall be received by the Contractor, in groups of 5 animals per week. The COTR shall determine the specific strain, age and gender of the animals to be sent, as well as the schedule for submission of animals for tissue collection.<br /><br />The Contractor shall transfer the existing aged rodent tissue bank holdings from the existing contract to the Contractor's facilities. The transfer shall be accomplished in such away to prevent any thawing of frozen tissues. The current contract aged rodent tissue bank consists of approximately 6,600 frozen tissue samples in two freezers and 500 glass slides stored at room temperature.</p>
<p>Upon receipt of the animals, the Contractor shall maintain them for three days under conditions where they will not be exposed to disease or other animals. Animals shall be maintained in filtered cages, no more than 3 rats or 5 mice per cage, with ad libitum food and water, a temperature range of 70-75oF and a 12/12 hour light/dark cycle. NIH31 laboratory diet (Rader et al., 1986, J. Nutrition 116:1777-88) shall be autoclaved, water shall be autoclaved, and cage bedding shall be autoclaved. Cages shall meet ILAR minimum floor space requirements per animals and population size as stated in NIH publication No. 85-23 entitled "Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals" (text available at http://www.nap.edu/readingroom/books/labrats/ ).</p>
<p>The Contractor shall record on the Vital Statistics Information Sheet the date of accession, strain, gender, age, weight, barrier of origin, special notes such as caloric restricted, and general condition including visible lesions. The Contractor shall euthanize each animal individually by CO2 asphyxiation and immediately collect, freeze and store the following tissues (flash-frozen in LN2 and stored at -70 to -80oC): serum, brain, eyes, heart, lungs, liver, spleen, ovary or testes, pancreas, small intestine, prostate, muscle, skin, kidneys, white adipose tissue, thymus and any tumors found. The Contractor shall provide immersion fixation of tissues with ethanol or formalin for special cases designated by the COTR in order to meet the needs of NIA-funded projects and to prepare tissue arrays. Tissues fixed for investigators' special requests shall be stored at room temperature or at 4oC as instructed by the COTR, and shipped to the investigator in the fixative. Tissues fixed for tissue arrays shall be embedded in paraffin and arrays prepared at the direction of the COTR. Master blocks of tissue arrays are prepared and sectioned onto glass slides (1" x 3"), and stored at room temperature. It is estimated that one (1) tissue array will be made per year. The Contractor shall use an appropriate mechanism for inventory control of frozen tissue, fixed tissue, embedded tissue, and tissue arrays. The Contractor shall maintain frozen tissues in two freezers, each of which is equipped with an independent alarm system and back-up generator. Approximately half of each sample cohort of tissue (same strain, age, gender) shall be maintained in each freezer.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall ship tissues and tissue arrays to investigators at the direction of the COTR, and invoice the investigator for the cost of shipping the tissue and a nominal fee set by the COTR.</p>
<p>REPORTS/DELIVERABLES: (1) Weekly inventory - an inventory indicating the number on hand of each frozen tissue type by strain, gender and age, the number of each tissue type entered that week, the total number of each tissue type entered to date, the number of each tissue type shipped to investigators, and the number of each tissue type currently available. (2) Copy of the Vital Statistics Information Sheet - one for each animal used for tissue collection. (3) Semi-annual progress reports - a report which details the number, gender, strains and ages of animals received for tissue banking, the number of orders filled, and the number of each frozen tissue type and tissue array delivered to investigators. The number of animals with tumors and the number of animals culled due to illness shall also be included. (4) Final Report it shall include a summation of the work performed under the entire contract period of performance, including number of tissue collected and number of tissues and tissue arrays shipped to investigators.</p>
<p>ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE. The anticipated period of performance is from 3/1/11 through 2/28/16.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS FOR WRITTEN INFORMATION ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICIATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS, AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is performing a ?market search? for large and small businesses in preparation for a future procurement.
The EPA has need for a contractor to provide support to its Office of Science and Technology (OST) within EPA's Office of Water (OW) to support the water quality standards (WQS) and beach monitoring and advisory programs.  This office has multiple responsibilities under the Clean Water Act of 1987 (CWA), as amended.  These include directing and overseeing the national program for adoption of water quality standards (WQS) and application of those standards to beach monitoring and advisory programs.  In accomplishing this mission, the program provides management strategies, guidance, assessments, technical support and tools for use by States and Indian Tribes in developing their water quality standards programs. The office also provides programmatic support for the implementation and evaluation of WQS by identifying, assessing and controlling risks to aquatic ecosystems.
Contract support shall require a superior level of technical and implementation expertise in the areas of water quality standards and its application to beach monitoring and advisory programs. The national WQS program engages in the following activities: developing regulations, policies and guidance on WQS program development and implementation; providing and coordinating technical support for development, adoption, and implementation of water quality standards and criteria to States and Indian Tribes, including expert support,; establishing national priorities for State and Tribal WQS programs; coordinating regional WQS reviews, approvals and disapprovals and national WQS promulgations; coordinating WQS information management and analysis; providing program related technical support, outreach, training, and education to Regions, States and Indian Tribes and other stakeholders; providing technical support for implementation of WQS including use attainability analyses, environmental assessments, economic and benefits analysis, and total maximum daily load (TMDL) calculations including use of geographic information systems, multi-media environmental fate and transport models, and water quality-based permitting; providing technical support for developing and managing cross-media and multi-Agency policies to ensure standards and exposure goals are attained; and coordinating policies with our partners in other federal agencies (especially the Services) to insure that all legal mandates are met, including consultation requirements set forth under the National Environmental  Policy Act.	The successful contractor shall provide technical, analytical, and statistical support for the WQS program in four areas: 1) preparing analyses, studies and reports for a variety of purposes, 2) supporting databases for scientific data or public comments, 3) performing field sampling and laboratory analyses, and 4) supporting meeting, training, and outreach efforts.  Further descriptions of these key areas are listed below.		The contractor shall provide source information and data, and generate reports, analyses, summaries, technical guidance documents, and environmental assessments to assist EPA in:  ?	determining water quality standards program priorities and program implementation; ?	developing economic and statistical analyses for regulatory and policy options including economic assessments of cost expected to be incurred by the regulated community, and local, state, and Federal governments; ?	supporting the Agency's regulatory and non-regulatory requirements for implementing the requirements of 40 CFR Part 131, and associated requirements of the Clean Water Act, including section 406,  ?	creating inventories of contaminant sources, and determining effects of discharges on receiving waters, and ?	generating technical, analytical and/or economic reviews on data and studies developed by the Office of Water and other EPA Offices.
The contractor shall provide technical support for compiling, maintaining, updating, analyzing, and modifying databases such as WATERS and STORET.  This includes supporting national and international environmental databases, and public comment databases to support EPA responses to public comments on proposed new or revised water quality standards.		The contractor shall provide technical support for performing field sampling for pollutants to support site-specific criteria development and other water quality standards modifications. The contractor shall also provide support for performing laboratory analyses, including analytical chemistry and biological testing. The contractor shall have or have access to the facilities necessary to perform laboratory analyses. 
	The contractor shall support the EPA for holding a variety of meetings and outreach efforts relative to the implementation of the WQS program.  Meetings may include training sessions (whether live, interactive, web-based, or satellite-based), interactive workshops, technical assistance workshops, public forums, facilitated negotiations, and conferences.  Contractor support may include providing web-based clearinghouses, facilitation, and expert speakers. Outreach and meeting materials may include public education and technology transfer documents, briefings, presentation materials, meeting notes and evaluations, and technical instructional materials.
The successful contractor shall provide all necessary labor, materials, facilities, and services in support of the efforts.  A draft PWS can be obtained from the OAM website, http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd/. It is anticipated that the contract will be a Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract with the ability to issue Cost Plus Fixed Fee/Level of Effort and Firm Fixed Priced Task Orders starting in July 2011 with a five year ordering period. The applicable NAICS code is 541620 with a size standard of $7,000,000.  

Any interested firm should submit information which demonstrates the firm?s ability to perform the key requirements described above.  Standard company brochures alone will not be considered a sufficient response to this Sources Sought Synopsis.   The information should include: size status for the above referenced NAICS code, (i.e. large, small) and whether or not they are a certified Hubzone, 8(a), women-owned, small disadvantaged and/or service disabled veteran owned small business concern, point of contact, telephone number, email and interest in proposing on the solicitation when issued.  
The EPA reserves the right to set this action aside for small businesses if it determines that there are two or more small businesses able to compete in terms of market prices, quality, and delivery.  If set aside, a small business would be required to perform at least 50 percent of the direct labor costs incurred under the contract with its own personnel (FAR 52.219-14).  Capability statements from small businesses should address their ability to meet this requirement.  Responses to the above should be submitted to Angela Lower, USEPA, 26 West Martin Luther King Dr., Cincinnati, OH 45268, or lower.angela@epa.gov) no later than May 11, 2010.  A separate synopsis will be issued for the Request for Proposal (RFP) resulting from this sources sought synopsis.

<p>A) BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The USAID Regional Mission for Central Asian Republics is headquartered in Almaty, Kazakhstan, with country offices in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan; Tashkent, Uzbekistan; Ashgabat, Turkmenistan; and Dushanbe, Tajikistan. Central Asia is bordered by Russia, China, Iran and Afghanistan. Due to its substantial oil and gas reserves, it is a region of considerable geopolitical and strategic interest to the United States.</p>
<p>The Regional Mission for Central Asia (USAID/CAR) is responsible for the strategic planning, program design and implementation, achievement of results, and reporting for the USAID assistance programs for the five Central Asian republics. The U.S. Government's program of assistance in the region is focused on the growth of small-scale enterprise and trade; building a more open, democratic culture; better management of environmental resources, including energy; and improved primary healthcare. It ranks as one of the Agency's largest programs, with funding levels that have averaged over $115 million annually. The Mission implements its programs together with more than 80 awards (acquisition and assistance). The staff manages a program that addresses six program areas principally focused on assisting these former communist states in making the transition to Western-style democracies with viable market economies.</p>
<p>The Mission currently has three technical offices: Office of Economic Growth (EG), Democracy and Conflict Mitigation (DM), and Health and Education (HE) and is in the process of developing its new whole-of government strategy for each country and the region for 2011-2016 that will create greater focus of our development efforts and require significant restructuring of our implementation portfolio.</p>

To the north and south, independent projects are being constructed in association with the Banks development including roadway improvements, multiuse development buildings with subsurface parking garages, and a realigned/reconstructed roadway.  Immediately adjacent and to the west is the Phase 1 site.  Phase 1 is currently being advertised.  The construction work will require a significant amount of coordination amongst neighboring building project teams and City agencies. Construction staging is located south of the project limits and the construction entrance will be from the north.  Construction will take place on-structure, atop a parking garage designed to accommodate parking for special events, park and city visitors and those working at the many businesses throughout the downtown area.  Site preparation for this contract will require installing a waterproofing system on the roof of the parking garage.  The waterproofing will consist of applying a hot fluid over the concrete deck. The fluid is a rubberized asphalt system with protection board and root barriers. Associated with the work are concrete repairs, sealant joints, and 3 compression joints with cover plates. The waterproofing contractor will be responsible for deck preparation; furnishing and installing the system; and providing protection and repairs to the system during installation of the surface features.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORKThe Veterans Administration Boston Healthcare System has a requirement to conduct continued research at the Center for Innovative Visual Rehabilitation (hereafter CIVR) to conduct  Hermetic Sealing, Leak Testing, and Overmolding of the CIVR Retinal Prosthesis.Program Duration:	June 1, 2010 to September 30, 2010October 1, 2010 to March 31, 2011 (Option Period 1)			April 1, 2011 to September 30, 2011 (Option Period 2)			October 1, 2011 to March 31, 2012 (Option Period 3)			April 1, 2012 to September 30, 2012 (Option Period 4)Vendor shall conduct the following engineering tasks in support of the effort at the CIVR to create hermetically sealed, electrically functional retinal prostheses. The work shall be conducted primarily at vendor site, with ancillary machining, assembly, and/or testing at the VABHS and other area facilities as required.  The purpose of this work is to develop materials and methods for hermetic sealing of subretinal prosthesis assemblies that shall be provided by the CIVR, and to develop adequate fixturing for measuring the leak rate of helium and/or water into current and future generations of retinal prosthesis packages that the CIVR develops (and subsequent performance of such tests.)  The final goal is overmolding the sealed prosthesis assemblies with epoxy to keep water away from the signal feedthrough connections.Objectives:	To optimize the process and document standard operating procedures for sealing CIVR-supplied platinum-coated titanium lids, water gettering devices and suture tab structures in or on to subretinal prosthesis assemblies (also be provided by the CIVR), leading to the mutual development of a formal procurement specification for future prosthesis assembly runs that are outside the scope of this contract.	To optimize the process and document standard operating procedures for overmolding hermetically sealed subretinal prosthesis assemblies (provided by the CIVR) with epoxy to keep water away from their signal feedthroughs, also leading to development of a formal procurement specification for future prosthesis assembly runs (outside the scope of this contract).	To design and fabricate test fixtures to evaluate helium and/or water leakage into current and future hermetically sealed subretinal prosthesis assemblies using available measurement technologies at Vendor and/or its subcontractors, and to perform and document these calibrated measurements.	To fabricate small engineering lots of both electrically inactive (dummy) engineering prototypes and complete, hermetically sealed and overmolded electrically active implants at the request of CIVR personnel, contingent upon component availability from the CIVR.The tasks required to meet these objectives are the following. All testing will be conducted and documented in a manner appropriate for reporting in peer-reviewed scientific publications and for supporting the future regulatory needs of the CIVR, with the exception of any technologies or processes that are deemed confidential by Vendor, and whose status is made known to the CIVR by Vendor in writing.  Vendor shall provide access to records and standard procedures developed during the contract period to the CIVR team members during routine vendor audits.  The following tasks shall be performed on a best effort basis.Task 1.	  Laser welding and hermetic sealing.Employing proprietary know-how, Vendor shall develop engineering processes for laser welding of subretinal prosthesis assemblies and their external suture tab components so as to form hermetically sealed enclosures with CIVR-procured water gettering devices inside. Standard operating procedures shall be documented, leading to the creation of a formal procurement specification for future assembly runs.Task 2.	  Overmolding.Employing proprietary know-how, Vendor shall develop engineering processes for overmolding of completed subretinal prosthesis assemblies with epoxy to prevent water from infiltrating the signal feedthrough region. Standard operating procedures shall be documented, leading to the creation of a formal procurement specification for future assembly runs.Task 3.	  Leak testing.Vendor shall design and fabricate test fixtures to evaluate helium and/or water leakage into current and future CIVR hermetically sealed subretinal prosthesis assemblies or feedthrough modules using available measurement technologies at Vendor and/or its subcontractors, and Vendor shall perform and document calibrated measurements at the CIVRs request.Task 4.  Engineering lot fabrication.Vendor shall fabricate small engineering lots of both electrically inactive (dummy) engineering prototypes and complete, hermetically sealed and overmolded electrically active implants at the request of CIVR personnel, contingent upon component availability from the CIVR.Vendors having capability to meet requirements are invited to submit quote with the appropriate documentation addressing their items ability to meet the above stated requirements and characteristics. All Quotes are due no later than 3pm EST on April 19,2010.No telephone requests will be accepted.  However, any firm that believes it can meet these requirements may send their quote by e-mail to Robert.oleary@va.gov. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail, to demonstrate the capability to comply with the below requirement.  Responses will be evaluated. Inquires/information received after established deadline of April, 19, 2010 3PM EST shall not be considered.  The submission of any data for review shall not impede award of this contract as planned.  The Government does not intend to pay for information solicited.

<DESC>Under the authority of FAR 13.106-1 (b)(1), in conjunction FAR 13, the United States Army Research, Development & Engineering Command (RDECOM) Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, Natick, MA 01760, on behalf of the WARSTAR Directorate, intends to negotiate and award a contract to Clariant Corp located at 85 Holden Industrial Park, Massachusetts, MA 01520. To provide the following materials:<BR><BR>1900 lbs of blue color concentrate #AB53620328. <BR><BR>The intent is to award 1 contract to procure the above mentioned materials on the basis of Other than Full and Open Competition.  <BR><BR>NATURE AND DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET AGENCY NEEDS: <BR><BR>The Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP), Department of the Treasury has given Fiber Project personnel authority to research, develop, and produce unique materials. Under requirements set forth by the BEP, no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Color concentrates are formulated with proprietary combinations of materials that are known only to vendor.<BR><BR>DEMONSTRATION THAT CONTRACTOR IS THE ONLY SOURCE AVAILABLE: <BR><BR>Supplies are available only from the contractor for the continued fiber production of the unique materials required by the BEP, when it is likely that an award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Fiber Projects requirements to the BEP. The contractor has maintained a good working relationship with the government and has delivered previous shipments of color concentrates (under contract #'s 09-P-0747, 08-P-0l 71, 06-P-0447,05-P-0544). Materials that are used are proprietary to the vendor - government does not have access to the formula due to proprietary information.<BR><BR>DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH THAT WAS CONDUCTED AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED: <BR><BR>Under the agreement with the BEP, Fiber Project personnel are constantly searching out new technologies, products and services to enhance the research, development, and production of our materials. A limited market survey/search was conducted and the results were that there are several other companies that could supply the government with similar materials (i.e., Penn Color, Hudson Color, Spartech Polycom, AmeriChem, and Badger Color) that could meet our unique material/equipment requirements. By dealing with another company, they would have to have time to analyze the material and be able to reproduce this specific color combination, and the added costs of time and trials are not acceptable.<BR>	<BR>ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION: <BR><BR>None <BR><BR>A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS IF ANY THAT AN INTERESTED PARTY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED: <BR><BR>Information received will only be considered for future acquisitions.<BR><BR>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:<BR><BR>Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this acquisition to the US Army RDECOM Acquisition Center, Natick Contracting Division, via email to: michael.griffin5@us.army.mil.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) (formerly known as the Health Care Financing Administration) intends to modify its contract HHSM-500-2005-00033I with the American Arbitration Association for arbitration services to resolve disputes with three States concerning Medicare coverage of certain home health services furnished to dual eligible beneficiaries and paid by the States' Medicaid programs. The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) has entered into individual agreements with the state Medicaid agencies of Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York (collectively, "the parties") to operate a demonstration program to determine the Medicare payment of certain home health services provided to certain individuals. If any one of the states or its agents is dissatisfied with CMS' determination of Medicare coverage for these claims, the parties have agreed to utilize arbitration services provided through the American Arbitration Association (AAA) to resolve the dispute. This project is being conducted under CMS' statutory authority to conduct Medicare demonstration projects, 42 U.S.C. 1395 b-1. <br />The proposed modification is for a one-year, no cost extension to the period of performance. See numbered Note 22. This announcement is for informational purposes only; no further notice will be published. <br />

<h1 style="text-align: justify;">DARPA GRID</h1>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;">DARPA is investigating the theoretical foundations and pragmatic implications of a Geometric Representation Integrated Dataspace (GRID), a compressive representation format for high-resolution 3D data of all sensor modalities. <span>&nbsp;</span>The envisioned GRID format would encode the 3D geometry and surface properties of objects at any spatial scale with extreme accuracy, and would enable revolutionary efficiencies in the storage, application, and exchange of 3D information across myriad industries.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;">This RFI seeks white papers, as detailed below, on topics that support a greater understanding of the opportunities for a common, standard format to represent geometric information integrated with surface properties in a fashion that permits easy encoding and rapid access to select portions of the information, as in a renderer. <span>&nbsp;</span>DARPA is seeking information on the technical research aspects of 3D representation as well as the application of 3D representation in real-world system. This RFI presages a symposium for the exchange of advanced concepts to further the aims of the GRID investigation and to form the foundations for a consensus on an eventual standard approach to an integrated representation.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;">The representation of 3D information&mdash;from the planetary scale to the molecular scale&mdash;is a technical challenge with far reaching consequences. <span>&nbsp;</span>Attempts to capture efficiently the 3D geometry and surface properties of objects in the world have historically pursued independent and industry-specific paths. <span>&nbsp;</span>As a result, a number of competing and incompatible schemes have emerged that generally rely on least-common principles such as pixel arrays for many 2D image formats and point clouds for 3D information. <span>&nbsp;</span>Moreover, industries have incentives to develop proprietary or specialized representation schemes for their particular products. <span>&nbsp;</span>While these representations preserve information, they yield highly voluminous and redundant databases, limit flexibility in the inclusion of new data sources, and inhibit the development of efficient applications and distribution systems.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;">However, recent advances in the representation of 3D surface information offer the possibility of efficient and accurate representation of 3D objects, using information derived from multiple and heterogeneous sensor modalities, in a way that not only permits great reductions in the storage of redundant information but also greatly increases fidelity of 3D object models. <span>&nbsp;</span>To that end, DARPA seeks information on academic and industrial research pertaining to advances in 3D representation.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;">As with any encoding technology (e.g., MP3, MPEG, and JPEG) GRID would involve three distinct concepts: format, encoding, and rendering. <span>&nbsp;</span>That is, GRID technology would <em>encode</em> data from many sensors into a common 3D <em>format</em> which can be viewed or otherwise processed through a <em>renderer</em>. <span>&nbsp;</span>DARPA recognizes these three concepts are closely related: the fidelity of a format may depend on the quality of the encoder, the choice of format may depend on the efficiency of the renderer, and so forth. <span>&nbsp;</span>DARPA is interested in innovative 3D representations that dramatically reduce the data storage volume required to carry precise information about the geometry and surface properties of objects and that, when rendered, yield images of high quality.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;">This RFI encourages responses that describe innovative approaches to a potential GRID format, encoding, and rendering. <span>&nbsp;</span>Of particular interest are techniques where the encoding process is largely automated. <span>&nbsp;</span>Examples of technical approaches include, but are not limited to:</span></p>

<DESC>Redacted J&A.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION < SAT

REFERENCES:

 In accordance with FAR 6.001 (a), full J&A documentation is not required for contracts awarded using simplified acquisition procedures of FAR 13 (except commercial items under FAR 13.5 > $100,000)
 FAR 13.106-1 (b) states that, For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand name, or industrial mobilization).  The following documentation constitutes the rationale for this decision.


DOCUMENTATION:

(1)	Requiring Activity:  

DFAS eSolutions 
3990 E. Broad St, Columbus, OH  43213
POC: XXXX XXXX
WAWF acceptor: XXXXXXX XXXXXX 
DODAAC of acceptor: XXXXX
Phone:  XXX-XXX-XXXX

(2)	Supplies or services being procured:  

The purpose of this document is to obtain the necessary approvals for a sole source order in accordance with FAR Part 13.106-1(b).  The justification is for a brand name product, ERM Perfect license, available from only one source, Composition Research Technologies, Inc (CR Technologies).

The purpose of this order is to purchase software required to implement a classified version of the Corporate Document Management System (CEDMS) at DFAS-Rome.  The software must be identical to the current software supporting the unclassified version of CEDMS 2.0 at Defense Automated Production Service (DAPS)-Mechanicsburg.  The Army has requested DFAS deploy classified version of CEDMS to store classified disbursing vouchers originating in Theater. 

In May 2009 CR Technologies was awarded a contract, HQ0423-09-P-0086, under a sole source requirement.  The justification for other than full and open competition was signed by the Contracting Officer in May 2009.  The intent to award to CR Technologies was posted in Fedbizopps.

The total estimated cost for ERM-Perfect term license, along with annual support and maintenance is $XX,XXX.XX.  A purchase order will be issued in accordance with FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures.

(3)	Reason that this is a sole source procurement (i.e., proposed contractor's unique qualifications, etc.):

The current CEDMS 2.0 configuration must be identical in both environments to minimize cost, maintain current system functionality, security and to eliminate implementation risks or implementation delays.  CRTechnologies software, ERM Perfect, is a core software component of this configuration.

DAPS previously procured the above listed software under full and open competition.  This included licenses for development and testing.  Those licenses have been maintained since procurement and are currently supported under contract number HC1013-06-F-2070.  The proposal to utilize the above outlined software suit logically flows from the current production environment into the new Classified CEDMS environment.

If these exact licenses are not purchased and installed in the classified version of CEDMS the following adverse actions would occur:

 Two separate system CEDMS software configurations would result in increased software maintenance and pose increased risk of system failure and downtime.
 If this specific software is not purchased DFAS would need to procure additional technical services to reprogram CEDMS to use different software components.  It will increase cost by $XXX,XXX.XX to $XXX,XXX.XX.
 Increase security risk.  DFAS requires each system to be certified and accredited in accordance with DoD regulation.  If the current system configuration is modified or altered the DIACAP on the unclassified version of CEDMS will be invalid.  The new software components would need to be revalidated to ensure they meet DoD security guidelines.
 DFAS senior leadership expects the classified and unclassified system to maintain the same configuration management.  As CEDMS 3.0 is developed a separate development effort would need to be procured to modify the classified CEDMS 2.0 if it has different software components.
 DFAS senior leadership fully expects implementation occur to June 30, 2009.  If new software components are introduced to the CEDMS solution this date would be extended by 6 months, thus impacting the schedule and increasing potential risk.
 DFAS users would also need to be retrained to use a different version of CEDMS if configured using different software components.

DFAS has already invested $X.X million dollars in the programming and implementation of CEDMS 2.0 in an unclassified environment.  If new software components were introduced into the solution DFAS would need to reinvest substantially more funds to reprogram/reconfigure the system.  This action would not be cost effective for DFAS or the department.

Ultimately, for the reasons stated above, a recompete and/or another product would result in substantial cost to the Government, that would not recovered through competition.

(4)	Market survey (indicate if any other firms were contacted or expressed interest)

Market research of other system development services was conducted by the CEDMS DAPS-COR who is knowledgeable about networked desktop systems, information security, and systems maintenance.  The DAPS COR has been working as an Information Technology Specialist for DAPS/DLA for the last 10 years, and has been experienced within the IT industry for past 25 years. 

The Original request for this effort was a full and open solicitation competed among all the DITCO GSA vendors.  This software purchase is a logical continuation to the contract installing CEDMS 2.0 at DFAS-Rome.

Based on research performed online at GSA Advantage and also via Internet through Google and other search engines, produced no other vendors that provide ERM-Perfect other than the manufacturer, CRTechnologies.  CRTechnologies was also contacted and they confirmed that they have no authorized distributors of the software.  In addition, it is currently available via the open market only.  

(5)	Technical requirements personnel certification

I hereby certify that this justification is made in good faith, that the supporting data and information are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief, and that I would not be making this request if it were feasible to fully compete this requirement.  I further certify that this request is not the result of lack of advanced planning or a desire to expend funds while those funds are still available.

<p>88 CONS H-002, Delivery Procedures Commercial Vehicles<br />All vehicles larger than a large pick-up truck are required to be inspected by the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base Commercial Vehicle Delivery Gate (CVDG) prior to entering the installation. Vehicles to be inspected include, but are not limited to, the following: <br />1. Step van/panel truck <br />2. Tractor/trailer, box and flat bed containing cargo<br />3. Tanker trucks <br />4. Box trucks<br />5. Tour buses <br />6. Garbage/recycled waste trucks<br />7. Concrete trucks/mixers, dump trucks<br />8. Cranes, recreational vehicles, petroleum tanker <br />This inspection will be conducted at Gate 16A located off State Route 444.<br />The following are exemptions to vehicles utilizing the CVDG:<br />1. If the vehicle has the product inside (concrete and asphalt trucks) and timely delivery is necessary due to product deterioration it does not need to enter the CVDG. To bypass the CVDG, the contractor shall submit a list containing drivers' names, social security numbers and the state in which the driver's license is held for those drivers who will be entering the base. This shall be accomplished 24 hours prior to requested entry time. If entry is requested on Monday, this list must be submitted by Friday at 1630 hours. All lists shall be submitted to the 88th ABW/CE Directorate contract inspector. The only gates that may be used under this exemption shall be 15A, 26C, 38C, 1B, 26C and gate 1B. If the driver's name is not on the list, he/she will not be allowed access to the installation through these gates and the base will not assume liability for denied access. <br />2. If a delivery vehicle must exit, and then re-enter the base to complete its route, the vehicle shall be resealed upon exiting the base. After initially passing through the commercial vehicle delivery gate, trucks shall be resealed at Gates 15A, 38C and 22B. The resealing of the trucks will allow them to continue to any other area of the installation (Areas A, B, C, or Kittyhawk) without reprocessing through the CVDG. To receive resealing assistance, the drivers shall physically stop at one of the three authorized gates and request the installation entry controller to reseal their truck and provide the next location of their delivery. The controller will reseal the truck and give the delivery driver a pre-clearance form. The driver shall present the pre-clearance form to the entry controller at the next point of installation entry. This reentry can be through any base gate.<br />Vehicles may be subject to an inspection at any of installation entry control points during a directed random antiterrorism measure (RAM.) Any commercial vehicle, regardless of size, can be directed to the CVDG at the discretion of the installation entry controller.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Attachments</span><br />Attachment 1: Description of Agreement</p>

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<BR><BR>Technical capability of offeror to meet the Government requirement; (ii) past performance; (iii) price/cost (see FAR 15.304)<BR><BR>Technical and past performance, when combined, is significantly more important when compared to price. <BR><BR>A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<BR><BR>All proposals will be evaluated by a team of Government employees. <BR><BR>Factors to be Evaluated: <BR><BR>Factor 1 Technical Approach<BR><BR>Factor 2 Past Performance<BR><BR>Factor 3 Price <BR><BR>The relative order of importance of the evaluation factors is as follows: Technical Approach is more important than Past Performance. The non-Price factors combined are significantly more important than the Price factor. Offerors are cautioned that award may not necessarily be made to the lowest price offered.<BR><BR>PHASE I -  The non-price factors will be evaluated to support best-value trade-off process for the two non-price factors. The non-price factors will be assigned an adjective rating, and proposals with an adjective rating of acceptable or be will no be considered for award.  The following adjective ratings will be assigned to the offerors technical and past performance portion of the proposal:<BR><BR> <BR>EXCELLENT -The prototype has exceptional merit and reflects an excellent approach which will clearly result in the superior attainment of all requirements and objectives. This clearly achievable approach includes numerous advantageous characteristics of substance, and essentially no disadvantages, which can be expected to result in outstanding performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is very low as the prototype provides strengths which are supported in the written technical proposal. The technical factors are further considered very low risk in that they are exceptionally clear and precise, fully supported, and demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirements. Essentially no doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort based on their past performance record.<BR><BR>GOOD -  The technical proposal demonstrates a sound approach which is expected to meet all requirements and objectives. This sound approach includes advantageous characteristics of substance, and few relatively minor disadvantages, which collectively can be expected to result in satisfactory performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is low as the proposal contains solutions which are considered feasible and practical. These solutions are further considered to reflect low risk in that they are clear and precise, supported, and demonstrate an understanding of the requirements.  Past performance indicates little doubt that the offeror perform the required effort.  <BR><BR>ACCEPTABLE- The technical proposal demonstrates an approach which is capable of meeting all requirements and objectives. The approach includes both advantageous and disadvantageous characteristics of substance, where the advantages are not outweighed by the disadvantages. Collectively, the advantages and disadvantages are likely to result in acceptable performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is moderate, as the proposal solutions are generally feasible and practical. These solutions are further considered to reflect moderate risk in that they are somewhat clear and precise, partially supported, and demonstrate a general understanding of the requirements. Some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort based on their past performance record.<BR><BR>MARGINAL - The technical proposal demonstrates an approach which may not be capable of meeting all requirements and objectives. The approach has disadvantages of substance and advantages, which if they exist, are outweighed by the disadvantages. Collectively, the advantages and disadvantages are not likely to result in satisfactory performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is high as the proposal contains solutions which may not be feasible and practical. These solutions are further considered to reflect high risk in that they lack clarity and precision, are generally unsupported, and do not demonstrate a complete understanding of the requirements. Significant doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort based on their performance record.<BR><BR>UNACCEPTABLE - The technical proposal demonstrates an approach which, based on a very high risk, will very likely not be capable of meeting all requirements and objectives. This approach has numerous disadvantages of substance, and advantages which, if they exist, are far outweighed by disadvantages. Collectively, the advantages and disadvantages will not result in satisfactory performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is very high as the proposal contains solutions which are not feasible and practical. The solutions are further considered to reflect very high risk in that they lack any clarity or precision, are unsupported, and do not demonstrate an understanding of the requirement. It is extremely doubtful that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort based on their performance record<BR><BR>In Phase II, the Government will evaluate the Price factor of the down-selected proposals. Price will be evaluated for reasonableness.  Economic Quantity Discount and revised pricing will be taken into consideration in Phase II. Each down-selected proposals price factor will be considered in relation to its non-price factors. Offerors are cautioned that award may not necessarily be made to the lowest price offered.<BR><BR><BR>9.

<SUBJECT>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) FY 2010 Emergent Research and Development Requirements
<SOLNBR>BAA0003-10
<RESPDATE>041211
<CONTACT>John Dormer, Contracting Officer, Phone 215-737-2284, Email john.dormer@dla.mil - Angela E. Mattox, Contract Specialist, Phone 703-767-6676, Email angela.mattox@dla.mil
<DESC>This notice constitutes a combined synopsis/ Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the acquisition of research and development in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 35.016 Broad agency announcement, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.    No formal solicitation will be issued.  Only the information provided in this notice is available.  Requests for same shall be disregarded.  It is intended that this BAA be open for a period of one year from the date of publication.

1.  BACKGROUND

The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Logistics Research & Development (R&D) Branch is charged with conducting research and development in all areas relevant to the DLA mission and across all DLA supply chains.  DLA defines its current R&D requirements each year and seeks funding for them through the Department of Defenses Program Planning, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) process.  These planned-for requirements produce a robust logistics R&D program addressing areas such as energy readiness, combat rations, uniform manufacturing, shelters, casting and forging, weapon system sustainment, medical logistics and electronics availability.  Despite these ongoing efforts, other R&D requirements arise each year that could not have been anticipated and were not budgeted. 

DLAs need for this Emergent (R&D) Requirements BAA stems from the appearance of these unplanned-for R&D requirements that are not addressed by the PPBE process.  Most of these requirements are in the form of additional research areas (beyond those funded by DLAs Presidents Budget request) added by Congress to the DLA R&D appropriation each year.  Other emergent requirements come from DLA in the course of the year.  These requirements can address virtually any logistics-related R&D topic and each year generally presents a mixture of new projects and new funding on prior years congressionally directed efforts.

2.  AREAS OF INTEREST

The particular emergent requirements that are the subject of this BAA are:  

(1)  Energy 

(a)  Exploring the use of various biofuels feedstocks in jet and other mobility fuels and examining the impact of introducing biofuels into the current jet fuel delivery stream.

(b) Development of modular and transportable advanced hydrogen-based energy storage systems that can be adapted to forward operating bases.  Particular interest exists in reconfigurable fuel cell and storage systems that are integrated with photovoltaic hydrogen generation capability.

(c) Evaluating new technology that converts waste to fuel and is scalable to a mobile unit prototype with the result of using waste feedstock to generate fuel for forward operating bases that is compliant with the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007.

(d) Advancing existing research technologies in carbon capture and sequestration for the future production of coal-based jet fuels for the Department of Defense (DoD).  Efforts in this area of interest should be directed to determining the feasibility of DoD applying these technologies through study and expert examination with respect to DoD requirements and include a plan for the coordination and execution of projects to demonstrate promising technologies.   

(2) Sustainment and Related Manufacturing 

(a)  Developing, testing, and applying new techniques to accelerate their adoption by small and medium sized firms of sustainable manufacturing techniques and their ability to manufacture green products.  

(b) Providing services including training and one-on-one assistance to small manufacturing firms either (i) that are located in the state or region in which the proposer is located or (ii) that are characterized by the Small Business Administration (SBA) as Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSBs) to upgrade capabilities to supply parts to DoD.   Services may include enhancing their reverse engineering capabilities, including developing acceptable technical data packages.  Training or assistance that is duplicative of services available from the DoD Procurement Technical Assistance Cooperative Agreement (PTAC) Program as described at http://www.dla.mil/db/ptap.asp and http://www.aptac-us.org/new/ are discouraged.

(c) Applications of existing logistics, engineering, and manufacturing decision support tools, expertise, and technologies to identify and resolve weapon systems support challenges at low cost.									
(d) Developing and demonstrating automated parts ordering tools based on Interactive Electronic Technical Manuals (IETMs) that allow a technician to requisition parts interactively from the IETM by capturing application data from the IETM and supplying that data to ordering systems and other authoritative sources.

(3)Distribution and Reutilization Operations

(a)  Technologies to improve the velocity, visibility, and value of distribution services provided by the agency, through its Defense Distribution Center (DDC) field activity, to the military services. 

(b) Technologies to improve the effectiveness and return on investment for the reutilization services provided by the agency, through its Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service (DRMS) field activity, to the military services in the 2050 timeframe.

(c) University-led efforts to study and develop Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technologies for use in defense logistics applications.

3.  GENERAL PROPOSAL SUBMISSION INFORMATION

<p>&nbsp;GENERAL</p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has determined that performance of the tasks as described in this future award requires that the Contractor, subcontractor(s), vendor(s), etc. (herein known as Contractor) have access to sensitive DHS information, and that the Contractor will adhere to the following.</p>
<p>SUITABILITY DETERMINATION</p>
<p>DHS shall have and exercise full control over granting, denying, withholding or<br />terminating unescorted government facility and/or sensitive Government information access for Contractor employees, based upon the results of a background investigation. DHS may, as it deems appropriate, authorize and make a favorable entry on duty (EOD) decision based on preliminary security checks. The favorable EOD decision would allow the employees to commence work temporarily prior to the completion of the full investigation. The granting of a favorable EOD decision shall not be considered as assurance that a full employment suitability authorization will follow as a result thereof.<br />The granting of a favorable EOD decision or a full employment suitability determination shall in no way prevent, preclude, or bar the withdrawal or termination of any such access by DHS, at any time during the term of the contract. No employee of the Contractor shall be allowed to EOD and/or access sensitive information or systems without a favorable EOD decision or suitability determination by the Office of Professional Responsibility, Personnel Security Unit (OPR-PSU). No employee of the Contractor shall be allowed unescorted access to a Government facility without a favorable EOD decision or suitability determination by the OPR-PSU. Contract employees assigned to the contract<br />not needing access to sensitive DHS information or recurring access to DHS' facilities will not be subject to security suitability screening.</p>
<p><br />BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS</p>
<p>Contract employees (to include applicants, temporaries, part-time and replacement employees) under the contract, needing access to sensitive information, shall undergo a position sensitivity analysis based on the duties each individual will perform on the contract. The results of the position sensitivity analysis shall identify the appropriate background investigation to be conducted. Background investigations will be processed through the Personnel Security Unit. Prospective Contractor employees with adequate<br />security clearances issued by the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) may not be required to submit complete security packages, as the clearance issued by DISCO may be accepted. Prospective Contactor employees without adequate security clearances issued by DISCO shall submit the following completed forms to the Personnel Security Unit through the COTR, no less than 5 days before the starting date of the contract or 5 days prior to the expected entry on duty of any employees, whether a replacement, addition, subcontractor employee, or vendor:</p>

<p>6. Authorization for Release of Medical Information</p>
<p>Required forms will be provided by DHS at the time of award of the contract. Only complete packages will be accepted by the OPR-PSU. Specific instructions on submission of packages will be provided upon award of contract.<br /><br />Be advised that unless an applicant requiring access to sensitive information has resided in the US for the past three of the past five years, the Government may not be able to complete a satisfactory background investigation. In such cases, DHS retains the right to deem an applicant as ineligible due to insufficient background information.</p>
<p>The use of Non-U.S. citizens, including Lawful Permanent Residents (LPRs), is not permitted in the performance of this contract for any position that involves access to, development of/or maintenance to any DHS IT system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;CONTINUED ELIGIBILITY</p>
<p>If a prospective employee is found to be ineligible for access to Government facilities or information, the COTR will advise the Contractor that the employee shall not continue to work or to be assigned to work under the contract.</p>
<p>The OPR-PSU may require drug screening for probable cause at any time and/or when the contractor independently identifies circumstances where probable cause exists.</p>
<p>The OPR-PSU may require reinvestigations when derogatory information is received and/or every 5 years.</p>
<p>DHS reserves the right and prerogative to deny and/or restrict the facility and information access of any Contractor employee whose actions are in conflict with the standards of conduct, 5 CFR 2635 and 5 CFR 3801, or whom DHS determines to present a risk of compromising sensitive Government information to which he or she would have access under this contract.</p>
<p>The Contractor will report any adverse information coming to their attention concerning contract employees under the contract to the OPR-PSU through the COTR. Reports based on rumor or innuendo should not be made. The subsequent termination of employment of an employee does not obviate the requirement to submit this report. The report shall include the employee's name and social security number, along with the adverse information being reported.</p>
<p>The OPR-PSU must be notified of all terminations/resignations within five days of occurrence. The Contractor will return any expired DHS issued identification cards and building passes or those of terminated employees to the COTR. If an identification card or building pass is not available to be returned; a report must be submitted to the COTR, referencing the pass or card number, name of individual to whom issued, the last known location and disposition of the pass or card. The COTR will return the identification cards and building passes to the responsible ID Unit.</p>
<p>SECURITY MANAGEMENT</p>
<p>The Contractor shall appoint a senior official to act as the Corporate Security Officer. The individual will interface with the OPR-PSU through the COTR on all security matters, to include physical, personnel, and protection of all Government information and data accessed by the Contractor.</p>
<p>The COTR and the OPR-PSU shall have the right to inspect the procedures, methods, and facilities utilized by the Contractor in complying with the security requirements under this contract. Should the COTR determine that the Contractor is not complying with the security requirements of this contract; the Contractor will be informed in writing by the Contracting Officer of the proper action to be taken in order to effect compliance with such requirements.<br /><br />CLAUSES AND PROVISIONS: The following provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition:<br /><br />Vendors shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Vendor Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items, with its quote, as required.<br /><br />FAR 52.252-2 CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE (Feb 98) <br />This contract incorporates one or more clauses by reference with the same force and effect as if they were given in their full text.

<p>This Statement is for Information Only:<br />It is not a Wage Determination<br />Employee Class Monetary Wage -- Fringe Benefits<br />Driver Courier $20.37 - $3.35<br />(End of Clause)</p>
<p>52.217-5 -- Evaluation of Options (Jul 1990)<br />Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206<br />(b) not to be in the Government's best interests, the Government will evaluate quotes for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(End of Provision)</p>
<p>52.217-8 -- Option to Extend Services (Nov 1999)<br />The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor. The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within 30 calendar days before the contract expires.<br />(End of Clause)</p>
<p>52.217-9 -- Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Mar 2000)</p>
<p>(a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within 30 calendar days before the contract expires; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 60 days before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension.</p>
<p>(b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.</p>
<p>(c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed 66 months.<br />(End of Clause)</p>
<p>Economic Price Adjustment for Gasoline: The awarded prices for the option period line items, if exercised, shall be adjusted for increases/decreases in gasoline prices at time of exercise.</p>
<p>(a) To the extent that contract cost increases/decreases are provided for by this economic price adjustment clause, the vendor warrants that the prices in this proposal for any option periods do not include any amount to protect against such contingent cost increases (no increases for gasoline prices included in the option periods).</p>
<p>(b) The cost index, for the purpose of price adjustment under this clause, shall be the American Automobile Association (AAA) Daily Fuel Gauge Report, Current Price per Gallon for Honolulu, Hawaii, unleaded regular, available at http://www.fuelgaugereport.com, as of April 12, 2010<br />(1) The Base Index, for the purposes of price adjustment under this clause, shall be $3.50, the most recent index published prior to the issue of this solicitation (rounded .5 and up, to the next higher number). This Base Index shall remain constant throughout the life of the contract, including all options.</p>
<p>(2) The Adjusting Index shall be the most recent Index published on the date the Government provides the contractor preliminary written notice of its intent to exercise an option period. In the AAA Daily Fuel Gauge Report Current Price per Gallon for Honolulu, Hawaii, Gasoline, unleaded regular discontinues, or alters substantially, its method of calculating the Index cited herein, the parties shall mutually agree upon an appropriate substitute for determining the price adjustment described herein.</p>
<p>(c) In preparation for exercise of an option period, the Contracting Officer shall apply the difference between the Base Index and the Adjusting Index to the option year prices by multiplying the increase/decrease times the number of gallons identified for each line item. Only the line items of the option year being exercised will be adjusted.</p>
<p>(d) An example of an adjustment calculation is provided below for informational purposes only.<br />For purposes of this example, assume that the contract price for the option period being exercised $2,000.00 per month, and includes costs for 200 gallons of gasoline. If the Base Index (the most recent index published prior to the issue of this solicitation) is $3.50 per gallon and Adjustment Index (the most recent Index published on the date the Government provides the contractor preliminary written notice of its intent to exercise an option period) is $3.65 per gallon, the calculations for contract price adjustment would be as follows:</p>
<p>Adjusting Index $3.65 per gallon</p>
<p>Minus the Base Index -$3.50 per gallon<br />Equals increase (or decrease) to the Base Index <br />$ .15 increase<br /><br />Option Line Item gasoline quantity multiplied by increase (or decrease) 200 * .15 = $30.00</p>
<p>Option Line Item price adjusted by increase ( or decrease) $2,000.00 + $30.00 = $2,030.00</p>

********STATEMENT OF WORK********

Atomic-Scale Nanoindentation Simulations Research

1.	Background

The NIST directors office is funding a new (FY2010 start) Innovations in Measurement Science project titled Building Metrological Foundations for Nanomechanics.  A key component of this research is to combine world leading nanoindentation and material characterization measurements with atomistic simulations.  Although the Materials Science and Engineering Laboratory (MSEL) has staff with general expertise with atomistic simulations, they have no direct experience with atomic-scale nanoindentation simulations.  To remain on track with the other critical measurement and modeling components of this project, this expertise must be acquired rapidly.

<DESC>This publication serves as notice of intent to procure services for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Mammal Laboratory located in Seattle, WA on a sole source basis with Atemar S.A. The government intends to acquire services using FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This notice represents the only official notice. Proposed vendor shall provide two qualified scientist for inclusion in the field party for the right whale survey, which will take place for up to 42 days approximately 14th July to 24th&nbsp;August 2010, exact dates will be determined by June 1st 2010. In August 2010, the Alaska Fisheries Science Center will conduct a research cruise in the southeastern Bering Sea, leaving from Dutch Harbor aboard a charter vessel and ending in Nome. This cruise will attempt to locate right whales using visual and acoustic techniques, and animals will be photographed and biopsy sampled whenever possible. In addition, satellite tags will be attached to right whales and also to humpback and fin whales. It is essential that the primary scientific staff for this cruise have extensive experience in working with large whale photo-id, biopsy sampling and satellite tagging, and with the protocols involved in this kind of survey. Atemar S.A. has completed similar work on three other federal studies of large whales. They have been involved in extremely specialized satellite tagging projects in both the West Indies and Alaska, given the protocols and methods used in previous projects were identical to those employed in the current project, it is important that these experienced individuals be contracted to maximize the efficiency of the sampling on the right whale cruise. The Government intends to negotiate a firm fixed price contract with the period of performance commencing approximately July 1, 2010 thru Oct 1, 2010 with no option periods.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) &#61551; Are, &#61551; are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) &#61551; Have, &#61551; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) &#61551; Are, &#61551; are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) &#61551; Have, &#61551; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

(Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) <br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). <br />(2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

If CBP canines are in the kennel, then only CBP personnel will clean the kennel. This prevents non CBP personnel from handling CBP canines.

If CBP canines become sick or injured while boarded at the kenneling facility due to negligence then they will pay for any medical bills incurred caused by this negligence.<BR><BR>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.</p>
<p>In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS-  United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program.

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interest parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interest parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the vest interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protest in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103.  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protest must be filled within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D.C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904.  The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202-372-3695.

<DESC>TELERADIOLOGY SOLICITATION #VA-257-09-RP-0028 QUESTIONS1. In regards to the pricing on pages 6-10 is the contractor guaranteed the volumes given? As given in the solicitation as follows, VA is unable to give definitive numbers for this requirement:  All quantities are estimates only and these estimates are however, the Government's best assessment of current needs and should be used for current planning purposes. The Government is not obligated to any specified quantity, but shall be obligated to provide payment for all services requested and performed in accordance with this contract. Imaging Service has given us there best assessment of their current needs as shown on pages 6-10, thank you for your consideration of this requirement.2. How long does the credentialing process take through the VA?  I am told approximately 6-8 weeks, give or take.3. What is the contract start date? Perhaps somewhere around the beginning of June or on or about June 1st, 2010.4. Will your credentialing department assist with physician credentialing?  Do not understand your question, but our credentialing office does assemble data like that utilized via the VetPro system.5. We are a JCAHO accredited company; will that expedite the credentialing process for you? No, it will not expedite the process.6. Solicitation VA-257-09-RP-0228 states that the contractor shall provide reports via VISTA and PowerScribe; is it possible to use an HL7 interface between our PACS system and the VISTA? We require the successful contractor to have their Radiologists' use our PowerScribe system [we provide the license(s)], via the One VA VPN, to render all of their reports. This system uses an HL7 interface program to communicate between itself and the VistA system which is the official reporting program. 7. How will we know what comparison studies are available for a patient and how will we get them?  Will a DICOM Q/R be available or will the technologists need to push them?  Imaging's practice is to send the current study and most recent relevant comparison study to the Teleradiologist for interpretation. We do not support Q/R at this time.8. Will we have access to your Power Scribe Server?  Yes - mandatory. We will provide the license(s) for use of our PowerScribe system.9. Is a server required from your site or sites to act as a DMZ server?  Or, with your VistA send directly over the Internet?  If so, can you send via a DICOM Lossless compression?   Currently would connect to Imaging over the internet via the VAs One VA VPN or RESCUE software. This will give the user access to our EMR as well as PowerScribe. Imaging will push images to provider's server for interpretation.10. How many VistA servers are we receiving studies from? One How many VistA servers are we returning studies to? None, once completed provider is bound to delete the studies. Imaging does have only a Central (consolidated) server system. (Want to know if there is a central Vista or not). We assume we are setting up a single VPN between us and CTVHCS/ National Security Operations Center.  Is that correct?  Yes, each Radiologist will have their own connection and then there will be a connection that Imaging will transmit images onto your PACS.11. How many radiologists do you have and approximately what % of their studies are they talking about sending to us.  Currently CTVHCS has 8 full time and 3 Fee Basis readers. The number of studies sent is not dependent upon a percentage of their studies. The estimate ranges for the various modalities are just that, the potential number of images that Imaging could send over the specified period (month).12. How do you determine which off-hour studies will be sent to us - some kind of overflow condition? Off-hours sends are ALL considered STAT reads. They will be coming from the ED and/or inpatient situations.13. Are we to read everything that is sent to us or would they like to set a status before we read something?  Industry standard timeframe everything that Imaging sends to the contractor is expected to be read. We will send a 'batch' of 'overflow' images and then in the evening, on weekends, and holidays we will send the ED and Inpatient images for reading.14. Is disk encryption required on our servers or our computers? No, but on all equipment that will store images we will require that you provide us the HDD upon contract termination.25. Section 7, subpart 4 Personnel Requirements addresses VA Form 10-2850 as a requirement for bid submission.  The VA is asking that each Radiologist complete this form and have them submitted with the proposal. This form seems pretty onerous to the Radiologists to have to complete before an award is even considered.  Can this form be completed upon a contract award?  Contractor shall provide the following information, immediately upon award, for each Radiologist.16. The government is asking for a significant investment in set up time and effort, government security clearance, maintenance of networks, etc.  Can the vendors charge a set up fee or monthly volume minimum to cover these costs? If not, can the government provide an estimate of the monthly volumes that will be sent? For example, will the successful bidder receive all of the off hour studies? The Government cannot direct an offeror to charge a set-up fee or a monthly volume minimum coverage rate to a proposal, submit your best and final offer. An estimate of the monthly volumes is provided under B.2 Supplies or Services and Price/Cost which incorporates the government's best assessment of current needs for this requirement and should be used for current planning purposes. Finally, the successful bidder will receive at a minimum the estimated quantity amounts of off hour studies as indicated in that schedule.

<DESC><p><strong>*** UPDATE 12 APR 10 ***</strong></p>
<p>Note: This is the same effort referenced on FedBizOpps # FA8622-09-D-5999-0100 and PIXS6441.</p>
<p>This notice is a follow-on sources sought synopsis to FBO # PIXS6441 posted on 23 Feb 10. No solicitation is being issued at this time; while a formal solicitation may be issued at a later date, this notice does not commit the government to ultimately award a contract.</p>
<p><strong>All substantive portions of the 23 Feb 10 sources sought synopsis are incorporated by reference. The purpose of this follow-on sources sought synopsis is to clarify FAR 52.219-14, "Limitations on Subcontracting." Small businesses are advised that FAR 52.219-14, "Limitations on Subcontracting," applies, wherein "at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern." It is the intention of the government to pursue the standard FAR clause language, wherein the small business prime contractor must intend to perform and demonstrate the capability to perform at least 50 percent of the entire scope of work described in the draft Performance Work Statement.</strong></p>
<p>Companies that responded to the 23 Feb 10 sources sought synopsis, please respond with your company name and confirm your interest in acting as a prime contractor or subcontractor, considering ability to comply with FAR 52.219-14. It is not necessary to resubmit any other information unless there has been a change.</p>
<p>Companies that did not respond to the previous sources sought synopsis, please respond with all of the information listed below. Responses to this synopsis shall include the following information:</p>
<p>1. State your interest in performing in the capacity of the prime contractor or as a subcontractor.</p>
<p>2. State your company's business size and status (including but not limited to: small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, service disabled veteran-owned small business, women-owned small business, historically under-utilized business zone (HUBZone) small business) in conjunction with NAICS code 541712, size standard of 1,500 employees.</p>
<p>3. State your company's CAGE code as listed in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR), and a point of contact (POC) name, telephone number, and e-mail address.</p>
<p>Do not mark your information "company proprietary" or with any other type of restriction. Any information submitted will become the property of the Government. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with this or future requests. Additional information, as it becomes available, will be posted as amendments to this announcement. Responses shall be made via e-mail to jonathan.taliani@wpafb.af.mil with carbon copies to alexander.slate@wpafb.af.mil, robert.johnson4@wpafb.af.mil, and laura.bushong@wpafb.af.mil. All pertinent information will be available for viewing at FedBizOpps (FBO), http://www.fbo.gov. It is incumbent upon the interested parties to review this site frequently for updates and amendments to any and all documents. All potential offerors are reminded, in accordance with FAR 52.204-7, "Central Contractor Registration," lack of registration in CCR, available at https://www.bpn.gov/ccr/default.aspx, will make an offeror ineligible for contract award. Additionally, in accordance with FAR 52.204-8, "Annual Representations and Certifications," offerors are also reminded to register with Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) at https://orca.bpn.gov. Please provide responses by&nbsp;19 April 2010. Any questions shall be addressed via e-mail to jonathan.taliani@wpafb.af.mil.</p>

As resource conditions and other factors warrant, excess wild horses and burros are removed from the public lands and placed in facilities for preparation to be placed in private maintenance through the Adopt-A-Horse program.
b.     The Wild Horse and Burro Holding Facility at Piney Woods (PW) is the primary holding facility for wild horses and burros awaiting adoption through the BLM's Eastern States Adopt-A- Horse program.  Piney Woods routinely receives animals from western facilities and then ships them to adoption locations throughout the 31 eastern states.  The facility will maintain approximately 150 animals throughout the year on a daily basis. 
The objective of this contract is to procure livestock panels and gates for the temporary holding of these animals when they arrive from the western facilities and await transport to adoption locations around the country.  Piney Woods is a permanent year-round holding facility requiring the use of this equipment for the animals residing on the facility.

ORIGINAL NOTICE--THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION NOTICE. No proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis.

<p class="MsoNormal">(2)<span>&nbsp; </span>The offeror unconditionally accepts the terms and conditions of the solicitation</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">(3)<span>&nbsp; </span>All members of the offeror&rsquo;s team (prime, subcontractors, joint venture partners, etc) that are proposed to perform Top Secret (TS) type tasks have an active TS facilities clearance</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Government intends to award the first task order for operations services in support of OSD concurrently with the multiple-award contract, with services to commence as early as 01 September 2010.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Government intends to hold a pre-solicitation conference on 27 APR 2010 from 10:00 AM to 12:30 PM at Rosslyn Plaza North (14th Floor, Conference Room #3) 1777 Kent St.  Arlington, VA 22209.<span>&nbsp; </span>All attendees are required to meet in the lobby no later than 9:45 AM.<span>&nbsp; </span>The objective of the conference is to answer industry questions and to emphasize/convey pertinent information to industry after reviewing the final RFP.<span>&nbsp; </span>Potential offerors are strongly encouraged to participate in the pre-solicitation conference.<span>&nbsp; </span>Due to space limitations, a maximum of two (2) representatives from each company may attend, and the Government reserves the right to limit attendance/participation to small business concerns.<span>&nbsp; </span>Please contact Patricia Watson or Mary Beth Brown (contact information below) by 2:00 PM on 23 APR 2010 in order to register and attend.<span>&nbsp; </span>Travel, lodging, and expenses are the responsibility of the Industry Representatives and will not be paid by the Government.<span>&nbsp; </span>The building is located near the Rosslyn Metro, and there is public parking (for a fee) in close proximity, as well.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Government is utilizing the procedures in FAR 15.3 &ldquo;Source Selection&rdquo; under competitive negotiated proceedings to select the proposals that represent the best value to the Government.<span>&nbsp; </span>The trade-off process inherent in best value source selection allows the government to consider award to other than the lowest priced offeror or other than the highest technically rated offeror, per FAR 15.101.<span>&nbsp; </span>Consequently, all evaluation factors and significant sub-factors that may affect the contract award and their relative importance will be clearly stated in the solicitation.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"> </span>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Government does not intend to hold discussions; however, the Government reserves the right to hold discussions if later determined to be necessary by the Contracting Officer.<span>&nbsp; </span>If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Government reserves the right to reject any and all proposals and award to other than the lowest priced offerors.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Offerors are required to register in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database at http://www.ccr.gov. Offerors must have an active registration in CCR prior to completing their Representations and Certifications (Section K) in the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). ORCA is an on-line system that is located on the Internet by going to http://www.bpn.gov. <br /> <br /> The information being requested does not constitute a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor to pay for any costs incurred as a result in replying to this notice. This notice should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The entire solicitation will be made available only on the Government Point of Entry (GPE) Website at <a href="http://www.fedbizopps.gov/">http://www.fedbizopps.gov</a>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Paper copies will not be available.<span>&nbsp; </span>Once the solicitation is posted, it is incumbent upon the interested parties to review this site frequently for any updates/amendments to this solicitation.<span>&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;</span>The Government intends to issue the solicitation in early May 2010 and award by 15 AUG 2010.</p>

<DESC>The Food and Nutrition Service awarded a contract on a sole source basis to the National Academy of Sciences, 500 Fifth Street, NW, Washington, DC 20001 under the authority of FAR 6.302-5.
<p>The National Academy of Sciences, Institute of Medicine (IOM), was established to investigate, examine, or experiment upon any subject of science or art of significance to an executive agency and to report on those matters to the Congress or any agency of the Federal Government. IOM has no institutional self interest in the outcome of its studies. It provides scientifically valid, impartial, and balanced advice and a neutral meeting ground for its committees.</p>
<p>The National Academy of Sciences has been identified as the only impartial source that can provide the measure of expertise, independence, objectivity, and audience acceptance necessary to deliver results that will help FNS in shaping the future direction of its research funds. The National Academy, through its Food and Nutrition Board (FNB), will convene a workshop under the auspices of the National Academies to assess the current state of research and propose new research approaches, data, analyses, or other means to push our scientific understanding of the relationship between food insecurity and obesity forward. The results of this project will help guide FNS's future research investments.<br />The estimated cost of this effort is $386,012.00.</p>
<p>The proposed project will be conducted as part of the program of the Institute of Medicine and coordinated by the FNB. The FNB was established more than 60 years ago, primarily to address issues of national importance that pertain to the safety and adequacy of the nation's food supply; to establish principles and guidelines for adequate nutrition; and to render authoritative judgment on the relationships among food intake, nutrition, and health. The FNB is a multidisciplinary group of biomedical scientists with expertise in various aspects of nutrition, nutritional biochemistry, food science and technology, epidemiology, food toxicology, food safety, public health, and food and nutrition policy. These scientists deliberate on global issues concerning food and nutrition, initiate studies that are later assigned to standing or ad hoc FNB committees, and then oversee the work of these committees.</p>

<AWARDEE>Fisher Bioservices, Inc., 14665 Rothgeb Drive, Rockville, MD 20850 US
<DESC>FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY - This contract modification provides Recovery Act (ARRA) funding to renovate the NIDDK Biosample Repository. The space required for the number of samples to be sent to the Repository is not sufficient and thus the Repository will need to undergo an expansion of repository capabilities requiring installation of new scientific equipment. This contract modification expansion could include demolition, HVAC upgrades, for freezers, modification of the sprinkler, freezer alarm monitoring as well as electric installation. This project will allow the Repository to continue its key mission, which is to collect, store and distribute samples from&nbsp;the NIDDK's major, multi-site clinical studies. By having a central collection, the NIDDK leverages the value of its major studies by making the resources created by those studies available to many other investigators.<br /><br />NOTE: Fisher Bioservices DUNS is 16-115-7953.<br /><br />NOTE: This action is not fixed price. The contract is cost reimbursable because the complexity required to coordinate, maintain, and manage a National Biosample Repository depends on variables that are unknown prior to contract performance. Neither the Government nor the contractor are able to estimate the exact price with any reasonable degree of certainty. Because of the unknown variables of the work, a fixed price contract could not be negotiated and award of a cost-reimbursement type contract modification&nbsp;is appropriate.

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or service will satisfy agency requirements (FAR 6.302-1). See posted J&A for further information.<br><br>The US Army Corps of Engineers, Rock Island District intends to award a sole source contract to Patriot Sensors & Controls Corp citing FAR 6.302-1 (B). To the best of the Government's knowledge, there are no other firms that can satisfy this requirement and a written solicitation will not be issued. The items to be procured are GEMCO brand rotary cam limit switches. A solution to improve reliability would be to retrofit the existing GEMCO rotary cam assembly with a metal cam assembly and eliminate the enamel cam assembly. These limit switches are necessary for the miter gates and the only way to retrofit the cam assembly is to utilize GEMCO metal cam assemblies because these units are all manufactured and designed by GEMCO and other type of manufactured units can not be utilized without a major rehab to the locks. THIS NOTICE IS NOT A COMPETITIVE REQUEST FOR QUOTES. A determination by the government not to open competition based responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government

<p>II. NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING PROCESSED</p>
<p>The purpose of this Justification &amp; Approval (J&amp;A) is to obtain approval to proceed with a sole source acquisition in accordance with FAR &sect; 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii). The proposed acquisition will be a firm fixed price (FFP) contract for on-orbit operations/sustainment support of the Global Positioning System (GPS) IIA satellite constellation for the period of one year beginning 01 Jan 2010 with six one-year options extending through 2016. The total estimated cost for this contract, including options, is approximately $28.1M. The anticipated award date for this contract is 16 Dec 2009.</p>
<p>III. DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES/SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE<br />AGENCY'S NEEDS</p>
<p>Under the contemplated contract action, The Boeing Company (Boeing) will provide engineering and related activities necessary to support on-orbit operations for the GPS IIA constellation. These services will include operation procedures, system test support, training, transfer and drift orbit operations, disposal planning and operations, performing engineering and related activities necessary to support orbital operations, and maintaining and operating the Telecommunications Simulator Module (TSM), located at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, FL. Boeing will also provide daily technical support, data evaluation and trending, anomaly resolution, provide on-orbit data collection, calculations and analysis, and maintain engineering liaison support to anomaly resolution and related activities necessary to support orbital operations. In addition, Boeing will update command plans and the Orbital Operations Handbook (OOH) following on-orbit anomaly resolution to assure integrity of continuing space vehicle (SV) operations; provide continuing support of the Operational Control Segment (OCS) and ensure compatibility with the GPS IIA SVs; and ensure continuing Space Segment/Control Segment (SS/CS) interface compliance via review, analysis, implementation, testing and documentation of technical changes and incompatibilities. Finally, Boeing will support integration for all upgrade activities between the SV and OCS and ensure command procedures and databases are maintained to support on-orbit operations.</p>
<p>The period of performance for these services will be from 01 Jan 2010 to 31 Dec 2010 and, if all options are exercised, through 31 Dec 2016. 3400 appropriations will fund this effort.<br /><br />IV. STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN <br />COMPETITION</p>
<p>10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii).</p>
<p>V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATION OR<br />NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY <br />CITED ABOVE</p>
<p>The GPS, a program administered by the GPS Wing (GPSW), is a navigational radio positioning, time transfer, and Nuclear Detonation Detection System (NDS) consisting of three components: SS, CS, and User Equipment Segment. The radio positioning and time transfer system provides a signal environment, which enables GPS users to precisely determine three-dimensional position, velocity, and system time. The SS consists of the GPS satellite constellation with its associated ground equipment and provides the following capabilities in support of the GPS mission: L-Band Signal-In-Space capability, an Ultra-High Frequency signal for crosslink transmission, and an S-Band uplink/downlink interface to the CS. The NDS provides the capability of near real time detection location, identification and characterization of worldwide nuclear events. The operational constellation includes GPS Block IIA, GPS Block IIR and IIR-M SVs and will in the very near future include GPS Block IIF SVs.</p>
<p>In 1983, the Air Force awarded a FFP contract (F04701-83-C-0031) to Boeing for the production of twenty eight GPS Block II SVs. In 1984, the Air Force awarded a modification to the F04701-83-C-0031 contract to Boeing for the addition of W-sensors to the remaining 19 GPS Block II SVs creating the Block IIA SV. The modification incorporated incentive and award fees to accommodate the increased risk to Boeing for these changes. In 1998, the Air Force awarded the II/IIA follow-on satellite sustainment contract (F04701-C-98-0002) to Boeing. Under that five-year Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee contract which the GSPW later extended for an additional five year period, Boeing provided on-orbit satellite maintenance, analysis, trending and reporting for the then nine GPS Block II SVs and 19 GPS Block IIA SVs. All the GPS Block II SVs have since been disposed and only GPS Block IIA SVs remain on orbit and require support by the contractor.</p>
<p>As the original designer and sustainer of the GPS Block II/IIA SVs, Boeing possesses extensive experience unique to the development, launch, and sustainment of those SVs including the implementation of procedures relating to the handling of classified information inherent to the design of the remaining GPS Block IIA SVs. Boeing's GPS sustainment experience is especially vital at the present time because the aging SVs require substantially more operational support than when they were new. Boeing's engineers have specific knowledge of GPS Block IIA satellite payload (e.g., navigation payload, NDS payload) and bus subsystems operations, mission planning, documentation, Telecommunications Simulator operations and maintenance, and anomaly identification and resolution as those matters relate to the current and future satellite constellation and OCS, data trending, and crew familiarization specific to the GPS IIA SV. They are intimately familiar with the GPS Integrated Mission Operations Support Center, which is operated and maintained on the Boeing IIF contract, a unique archival and data retrieval system used by the operational warfighter for accurate and timely satellite data trending as well as an aid to anomaly resolution. They created the GPS Block IIA OOH and update it on a regular basis to support the operational community. With respect to anomaly resolution, any source performing the services described in Section III above must have in-depth knowledge and experience with the systems and processes described above in order to quickly identify and resolve any anomalies - because an inexperienced contractor may not recognize a problem or react quickly enough to prevent unrecoverable errors. Boeing's engineers have witnessed the majority of anomalies and know the root causes of these past anomalies. That experience cannot be met by any other source without that source experiencing the same learning Boeing has experienced over the past 10 years.</p>
<p>In addition, Boeing's engineers currently operate and maintain the TSM, a complex test asset utilized by the entire GPS program. Located near the GPS ground antenna at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, the TSM is a ground-based engineering representation of the space-based GPS Block IIA SV Boeing built from engineering development models (EDMs). It is used to test changes to telemetry, tracking and commanding software before those changes are used during mission operations to ensure that such changes will not adversely affect mission operations when uploaded to a GPS Block IIA SV. The physical configuration of the EDMs varies slightly from the GPS Block IIA SV. This acquisition will require the maintenance and operations of the TSM. Although Boeing brought those EDMs up to acceptable electrical performance, they occasionally exhibit out of tolerance characteristics (e.g., timing) as compared to the electrical performance of a GPS Block IIA SV. Only Boeing's engineers possess extensive knowledge of these characteristics, knowledge which is essential to effectively maintaining those SVs.</p>
<p>Finally, Boeing's engineers ensure continuing SS and CS interface compliance due to the fact that there is a close relationship between the division that will perform the contemplated contract and the division currently building GPS Block IIF SVs and modifying the CS to operate those SVs. The communication between these two groups is exceptional. Any changes to the existing OCS or other SVs (e.g., GPS Block IIR, IIR-M, GPS Block IIF) must be compatible with the GPS Block IIA SVs. In order to ensure this compatibility, Boeing engineers participate in technical meetings and review design documents with the other GPS SV manufacturer (Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company). This knowledge is not easily captured or transferable to another source because of the unique design and operation of those satellites. Therefore, this acquisition will be a follow-on contract for the continued performance of a highly specialized service.<br />The GPSW believes that award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Air Force's requirements. The GPSW estimates it would take another source a minimum of two years to become sufficiently familiar with the GPS Block II/IIA SVs and their performance history, the past and future SV trending data, the GPS Block IIA OOH, and SS and CS interface compliance to be able to perform the services described in Section III above. This estimate is based upon Boeing's on-orbit sustainment performance for over 10 years and its inherent experience with the anomalies that have previously occurred and the likely anomalies that will occur in the next five years. If during that period of time the IIA SV incurs an anomalous condition, such as deviating from the required orientation of the SV to the earth, the warfighter would have reduced signal coverage on the earth's surface, causing the accuracy of the GPS receiver equipment to be degraded. This degradation would decrease the positional accuracy of personnel, weapons targeting, etc. in the local area resulting in greater potential for personnel to be in the wrong location, weapons striking off-target and ultimately increasing the potential for additional loss of life (both civilian and military). In contrast, given the experience and expertise of its engineers described above, Boeing is able to provide such highly specialized services starting from the date of contract award.</p>
<p>Accordingly, Boeing is the only firm capable of providing the services described in Section III above without the Air Force experiencing unacceptable delays in fulfilling its requirements.</p>
<p>VI. DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE OFFERS ARE SOLICITED <br />FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS DEEMED PRACTICABLE</p>
<p>On 19 December 2008, the Contracting Officer posted a sources sought synopsis under solicitation number 09-07. The synopsis contained a brief description of the requirement described in Section III above and invited firms interested in performing those services to submit a Statement of Capability (SOC) describing their ability to satisfy those requirements. Only Boeing responded to the synopsis by providing an SOC.</p>
<p>VII. DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE<br />ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND<br />REASONABLE</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer will have adequate information to ensure that the cost/price to the Government for this acquisition will be fair and reasonable based on (1) historic cost information contained in the GPS IIA contract, (2) certified cost and pricing data obtained from Boeing, (3) Government established objectives based upon that historical data, (4) Defense Contract Audit Agency audit reports, (5) Defense Contract Management Agency recommendations, and (6) technical evaluations conducted by the GPSW.<br /><br />VIII. DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND THE<br />RESULTS, OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASONS MARKET RESEARCH WAS<br />NOT CONDUCTED</p>
<p>As described in Section VI above, market research, in accordance with FAR Part 10, was also conducted by synopsis of the proposed acquisition, advising industry of the pending acquisition and soliciting inquires from interested parties. In addition, the Program Manager conducted extensive market research via the Internet. Specifically, the Program Manager evaluated one hundred and eleven company websites for GPS experience, experience with GPS sustainment and operations, or both. The Program Manager also evaluated each company's website for sustainment and operations experience on other satellite programs. Only a limited number of companies had experience with sustainment or operations, but none other than Boeing had experience with the GPS Block IIA SV.</p>
<p>IX. ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN<br />COMPETITION</p>
<p>None.</p>
<p>X. LIST OF SOURCES, IF ANY, THAT EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THE <br />ACQUISITION</p>
<p>See Section VI above.</p>
<p>XI. A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO<br />REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE<br />MAKING SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITIONS FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES<br />REQUIRED</p>
<p>Any follow-on contract to the proposed acquisition will be publicized using a sources sought synopsis. In the event the Air Force becomes aware that another contractor is capable of fulfilling the requirement during the course of the proposed acquisition's period of performance, in accordance with FAR &sect; 17.207(d) the Contracting Officer will consider that information when deciding whether to exercise the next option period.</p>
<p>XII. CONTRACTING OFFICER'S CERTIFICATION</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer's signature on this Coordination and Approval Document demonstrates this document to be both accurate and complete to the best of his knowledge and belief.</p>
<p>XIII. TECHNICAL/REQUIREMENTS PERSONNEL'S CERTIFICATION</p>
<p>As evidenced by their signature on the Coordination and Approval Document, the technical and/or requirements personnel have certified that any supporting data contained herein that is their responsibility is both accurate and complete.</p>

<DESC>Justification for Other than Full and Open CompetitionAgency:  Department of Veteran's AffairsContracting Activity:	Acquisition Service Area Office East - 8			Orlando VA Medical Center,			5201 Raymond Street			Orlando, FL 328031.  Nature and/or description of the action being approved. The Orlando VA Medical Center has an ongoing program to furnish eye exams and eyeglass services to veterans that require them and are eligible for assistance. The service contract for these services expire on March 31, 2010.2.  The supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs.A bridge contract for eye exams and eyeglasses will be awarded for a period of 6 months with one 6 month option to Visioncare Consultants of FL for Orlando Onsite & Offsite service.3.  Demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.The incumbent, Visioncare Consultants of FL, is a Veteran Owned Small Business.  They have successfully provided these services for the past four years.  There have been no unfavorable performance reports in the period of our association.  4.  Other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition. The required services are urgently needed to ensure the continuity of veteran's eyeglass prescriptions.  A lapse in service would pose a significant risk to the lives and welfare of veterans receiving care at the Orlando VAMC and its satellite clinics.5.  Actions, if any, the agency may take to remove/overcome barriers to competition before subsequent acquisitions.During the term of the bridge contract, a long-term contract with options will be solicited and awarded competitively in accordance with FAR and VAAR requirements.  This interim emergency coverage is required to ensure the continued availability of eye exams and eyeglass services.6.  Technical or requirements personnel certification.I hereby certify that the supporting data which is the responsibility of technical and requirements personnel, and which forms a basis for the justification, are accurate and complete.7.  Statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.This procurement will be conducted under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c)(2), as implemented by FAR 6.302-2, Unusual and Compelling Urgency.  Delay in patient treatment would pose an unacceptable risk to the lives of veteran patients and could result in serious injury, financial or other injury to the Department of Veteran Affairs.  Additionally, it is unlikely that another source could staff, mobilize and begin contract performance in the short lead-time available.8.  Efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a FBO notice was or will be publicized.   A notice of the bridge contract will be publicized through FedBizOpps.  No other offers were requested and no other companies expressed an interest in this acquisition.   The long-term follow-on contract will be publicized and competed in accordance with FAR Parts 5 and 6.9.  Determination by the Contracting Officer that anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable. This is an on-going requirement; prior awards provide sufficient historical price data to support a determination of fair and reasonable price.     10.  Description of the market research conducted and its results, or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted (see FAR Part 10).  Market research was not conducted for the proposed bridge contract.  It is unlikely another vendor could staff, mobilize and assume contract performance in the short lead time available.11.  A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed in writing an interest in the acquisition.Due to the urgency of the requirement, no other sources were available to meet the turn around time requirements, and no other sources expressed in writing an interest in this acquisition.12.  Contracting Officer's certification.I hereby certify that the above justification for other than full and open competition is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.ANITA K.

<DESC>Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC) DocumentThe following Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition is prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements and the Department of Veterans Affairs Acquisition Regulation (VAAR) 806.304.	1.  Agency Identification 	Department of Veterans Affairs (519)West Texas VA Health Care System (WTXVAHCS)300 W. Veterans Blvd.Big Spring, TX  797202.  Description of Action Being ApprovedThis Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC) comes as a result of a current, on-going requirement, now deemed as an emergency, at the West Texas VA Health Care System (WTXVAHCS) to procure, in lieu of a 5-yr lease, an EvoTech Endoscope Cleaner and Re-processor (ECR) System, to include accessories with Ethicon, Inc doing business as (DBA) Advanced Sterilization Products Division who is a subsidiary of Johnson and Johnson Health Care Systems, Inc.  Ethicon further provide sole source justification, letter dated June 2008 (Attach).  The following justification is further supplied:3.  Description  The equipment and supplies being procured for the EvoTech ECR with Ethicon, Inc., will keep the VAs SPD section compliant (i.e., up and running) as a lease was deemed inappropriate by VISN Legal and should the current item (i.e., old and constantly breaking down) arise that would be cost prohibited if not purchased outright.  The EvoTech ECR System includes: Equipment kit (P/N 50014); Pre-Install (P/N 50040); Chemical clean kit 9P/N 50054); Channel separator, Olympus (P/N 0900301); Conntube 09600 in kit 9P/N 0845001); Connector tube, yellow (P/N 0841902); Conntube 09601 (P/N 0845301); Conntube 09600 (P/N 0845701); Connector tube, brown (P/N 0842103); Channel connector tube G (P/N 0841502); and adapter WTRJT, Olympus (P/N 0940801).     4.  Statutory Authority/Authority Cited  The basis of this JOFOC is the criteria implemented in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. (a) Authority. (1) Citations: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1). (2) When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, or, for DOD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, from only one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for. 	5.  Reason for Authority CitedThe reason for citing FAR Part 6.302-1 as the statutory authority for this JOFOC is that it is appropriate in this situation where the agencys needs could only be satisfied by the unique supplies/services available through Ethicon, Inc.  Application. This authority shall be used, if appropriate, in preference to the authority in 6.302-7; it shall not be used when any of the other circumstances is applicable. Use of this authority may be appropriate in situations such as the following (these examples are not intended to be all inclusive and do not constitute authority in and of themselves): (1) When there is a reasonable basis to conclude that the agency's minimum needs can only be satisfied by- (i) Unique supplies or services available from only one source or only one supplier with unique capabilities; 6.  Demonstrate Proposed Contractors Unique Qualifications.  The following are some of the items that make Ethicon, Inc. a responsible and reliable source:Ethicon, Inc. designed and installed the current system at the WTXVAHCSEthicon, Inc. only manufactures all accessories to support the EvoTech ECR System.Additionally, the current Endoscope cleaner which the government (WTXVAHCS) has previously procured and owns outright is outdated, inefficient, but tied directly into SPD end-users use, testing, etc upon the remainder of facilities systems.  It is also prudent to mention that no other qualified vendor outside Ethicons network can/will perform any incidental work upon this aforementioned system due to its proprietary rights and infringements therein upon and IAW FAR 6.302-1.  7.  Sources Sought Efforts.  The agency has done informal market survey via phone calls and pulling-up the GSA FSS Schedule Sources, has searched the FBO database, and CCR database for similar manufactures.  Additionally, a sources sought for lease was accomplished via FBO on Dec 16, 2009 as well.  This formal/informal survey resulted with no positive feedback from other manufacturers that can provide the needed maintenance contract, parts, etc due to the proprietary nature of Ethicon, Inc. design and associated data for the EvoTech ECR  FAR 6.302-1.  Thus WTXVAHCS also intends to release a special notice of this sole source requirements award utilizing FBO, IAW FAR Part 5.  Additionally, in accordance with the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, Section 844 Public Disclosure of Justification and Approvals Documents for Noncompetitive Contractswithin 14-days of contract award.  8. Determination Fair and Reasonable. The prices offered by Ethicon, Inc. for the EvoTech ECR System, are considered fair and reasonable by virtue of comparing historical maintenance-n-repair costs at this facility, lease cost options + the IGE all IAW FAR Part 6, then, in-fact, Prices proposed are Fair and Reasonable (IAW FAR Part 15.405), which a prudent and competent person would be willing to pay.  Prices are also considered allowable and allocable IAW FAR Part 31.201.  Lastly, being sole source, pricing is also negotiable, and this office intends to make every effort to potentially receive better rates than Ethicon, Inc. lists on-line via its open market.9. Description of the Market Research Conducted and Results.  The formal/informal survey resulted with no positive feedback from other manufacturers that can provide the needed maintenance and repair contract.  All roads point to Ethicon, Inc. having exclusive proprietary rights upon their EvoTech ECR System, parts and integration/maintenance herein.  Additionally, since this system was facility/location specific in its design-build parameters, then tearing out current system, reverse engineering and/or design-build a new system from scratch would take excessive amounts of time and money beyond the initial systems practicality basis.  Last, without the current system in-place, then emergency calls (i.e., patient, life safety, disaster, etc) could not be broadcast to all personnel in and around the facility, thus potentially causing ill-fated and possible irreversible possibilities.  Thus, due to the aforementioned, a savings of resources such as time and money, as well as potentially averting a huge disaster is in the best interest of the West Texas VA Health Care System, and the VA, as a whole.   10. Technical Requirements CertificationI certify that the supporting data under my cognizance which are included in this document are accurate and complete to the best of my belief._//Signed//__		               _March 25, 2010_Amber Fannin		               A&MM Chief                             Date11.
