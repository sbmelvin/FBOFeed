<DESC>The FDA intends to award a sole source procurement to GE Infrastructure Sensing, Inc located at 1100 Technology Park Drive, Billerica, MD 01821. Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.
An award will be made seven (7) calendar days from the date of this notice.
	
DECRIPTION OF ITEMS: The system that was purchased will provide an integrated Monitoring System using iFIX SCADA for Windows XP software and wireless sensor hardware, including Kaye Validator, X2005/X2025. The primary function of the system shall be to provide continuous monitoring, alarm detection, alarm notification, reporting, and historical data collection and analysis of critical process data pertaining to the Pandemic Flu Sterility and Lyophilization Suite. 

The GE Kaye Sensor system is an add-on sensor package for the existing GE system that has been purchased and there are no sensors available from any other source that will work with this system. The Add-on Sensor?s will provide ultra-high accuracy temperature and pressure data to the monitoring computer system for validation and removes common sources of error because the integrated electronics will constantly monitor and verify environmental conditions in critical areas of sterility and vaccine processing areas. The GE add-on sensor?s allows us to reduce system error while eliminating the cost and effort of calibrating supporting equipment and is required for Temperature Logger Calibration, Carbon Dioxide, Humidity and Pressure calibration verification. For thermal validation applications, the sensor?s communicates dynamic temperature directly to the GE Kaye systems to check the operation of the system. The Pandemic Flu facility and associated support labs require continuous monitoring of critical units that provide storage for regents and chemical?s needed to maintain the functionality of the overall operation of the lab. The GE Kaye Datalogger IRTD technology that will be used will provide scalability and ability to verify the conditions of monitored units. The system can meet certain requirements (described below) and can be dedicated, validated and quality controlled in an ISO 17025 laboratory for use in support of Pandemic Flu related activities. 

                 JUSTIFICATION FOR SOLE SOURCE: There are no comparable units on the American Market at this time that would allow integration with GE LabWatch system. The purchase of a comparable OEM system could raise the issue of             compatibility with GE Sensing system and could be more expensive and some additional purchase of cabling and hardwire connectors may be required.

<SUBJECT>A--AIR GUN MODIFICATION AND FABRICATION
<SOLNBR>N0016707Q5262
<CONTACT>Hugh Harrison 301-227-1123
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD) is responsible for the engineering evaluation of various Navy platforms and plays a major role in the congressionally mandated Live Fire Test & Evaluation (LFT&E) efforts overseen by the Office of the Secretary of Defense.  In direct support of the OSD LFT&E program, a requirement to fabricate a full-scale air gun array that will allow an alternate approach to a full ship shock test (FSST) to be implemented has been identified.  The array is a modification to an existing design and is required in preparation for a UK/US collaborative trial on the ex-NEWCASTLE to be held in the UK in early 2008 and also for the testing of the LCS surrogate ship in the US in late 2008. Using Simplified Acquisition Procedures, NSWCCD intends to negotiate a non-competitive procurement with Weidlinger Associates, New York, NY 10014. This requirement is follow-on tasking to Weidlingers Associates contract N00167-05-C-0027 awarded under SBIR Topic N03-51. A competitive procurement at this time would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government which is not expected to be recovered through competition. All responsible sources submitting offers will be considered.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties may forward their capabilities statements to the Government POC on or before 09/02/2007 and referencing RFQ N00167-07-Q-5262.

 The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency has a requirement for the brand name software licenses and annual software maintenance agreements as outlined above. All of the products referenced in this posting are proprietary products of Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC). SAIC is the sole producer of GeoRover software and annual maintenance. Due to the fact that this software is already integrated into the NGA enterprise it would be extremely costly to switch to a new type of software. Personnel would have to be trained to use the new software and NGA would suffer unacceptable production delays due to the implementation of the software. The GeoRover software suite is the only software that fulfills the form, fit, and function requirements of the NGA at this time.

<DESC>Notice of intent to award a sole source procurement of WEATHER STATIONS from FOREST TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS LTD., 1065 Henry Eng Place, Victoria, BC V9B6B2., under U.S. General Schedule #GS-07F-9253S.  The Forest Technology Systems (FTS) LTD will provide two weather stations which include sensors, datalogger, power manager, solar panels, SDI expansion box, GOES G5 transmitter, antennas, tri-leg tower, and batteries.  These weather systems are in support of an on-going study directed by the National Parks Omnibus Management Act of 1998 which directs the National Park Service (NPS) to "establish baseline (resource) information and to provide information on the long-term trends in the condition of National Park System resources."  Long-term conditions and trends are monitored through a set of critical Vital Signs unique to a Network.  The Southwest Alaska Inventory and Monitoring Network (SWAN) identified Climate Monitoring as a critical Vital Sign to monitor.  This is a follow-on requirement for the NPS in support of its mission.  Currently, the NPS has five complete remote automated weather stations and associated software designed and manufactured by FTS.  Under authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), the value of the procurement is expected to be under $100,000. This Notice of Intent is not a request for Expressions of Interest (EOIs), proposals or quotations.  No solicitation document exists and no telephone inquiries will be accepted.  No contract award will be made on the basis of EOIs, proposals or quotations received in response to this notice.  This service will be procured under Firm Fixed Price Commercial in accordance with FAR Part 12 procedures and Other Than Full and Open Competition as authorized under FAR 6.302-1. The anticipated award date is September 18, 2007. Point of contact for this acquisition is Ms. Marichu Relativo at 907-644-3311 or email: marichu_relativo@nps.gov. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement, and should furnish detailed data (10 pages or less) concerning their capabilities to provide the services sought including pricing data and technical data sufficient enough to determine that a comparable source to the government is available.  The Government will be the sole determiner regarding an offeror's ability to meet all requirements.  The government will consider all EOIs received prior to 3 days after date of publication of this synopsis before 4:00 pm Pacific Standard Time on that date. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  EOIs sent via the U.S. Postal Service should be mailed to National Parks Service, Alaska Regional Office, Attn: Marichu Relativo (AKRO-APM), 240 W. 5th Ave, Room 114, Anchorage, Alaska 99501. EOIs sent via Federal Express or hand carried must be delivered to the same address above during weekdays, excluding federal holidays, between the hours of 7:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m.  EOIs may be submitted via facsimile to Attn:  Ms. Marichu Relativo, Contracting Officer, at 907-644-3802 or email at Marichu_Relativo@nps.gov.  The facsimile transmission must clearly identify this notice and the name of the contracting officer on the first page.  Submitters bear the burden of ensuring that the EOI reaches the designated contracting officer on time and should allow a reasonable time for facsimile transmissions to be completed.  All pages of the transmission must reach the office before the deadline specified and pages of a facsimile transmission that arrive in the office after the specified deadline will not be considered.  The submitter bears the risk of non-receipt of facsimile transmissions and should confirm by telephone that any facsimile was received.

A3: It does not have to be a perfect match, but a match acceptable to VA Engineers  Q4: Spec discusses using triple insulated glass units with integrated blinds.are options allowed? A4: For bidding purposes please used specified triple insulated glass units with integrated blinds.  Options may be considered at a later date. Q5: Roof access and the height is a detail which we need more information on a.	First, if the roof is to be replaced, can it be done after the window project so as to not damage the new roof by anchoring the swing system on each roof to access the exterior of the windows? A5a: We have no control over which project may begin first. b.	Are their roof anchors already available in all areas? A5b: The A-wing room is the only roof that has roof anchors (Newer wing).  All other roofs have no anchors. c.	Do you have elevation heights in order to provide correct scaffolding estimates A5c: Elevations are provided on drawing A1.  Heights from ground to roof are given. d.	It was discussed that full size, scaled drawings might be available.can these be posted for review and use in windows counts and elevation/site setup preparation? A5d: Engineering can provide drawings Q6: There is a section which mentions: walls that receive window replacement to re-caulk all windows from the ground floor to the 6th floor.all windows or only those which are replaced? 	A6: All windows Q7: Spec mentions caulking in several places in referencing the windows but in one place mentions caulking on the interior.  Are all windows to be caulked on the interior as well as the exterior? A7: Yes all windows to be caulked.  Interior to be completed after all exterior pending award amount.  All interior work to be scheduled with project engineer. Q8: Spec mentions limestone joint caulking.  What is referred to by this?  Nothing was discussed on this item at the site visit.  It is on sheet 1 of 1 of the drawings the spec book on the General Note #2 (the second #2!).  Is this referring to some expansion joint, or a joint around all windows, or is that referring to the perimeter around every brick??  If expansion joint, where do the run or is it shown and visible on the full size drawings? A8: Refers to the sealing of exterior panels on the A-Wing.  See Drawing 2 of 3 North and West elevations.  This includes sealing of all panels from ground to 6th floor on the affected areas as noted on drawings 3 of 3 Q9: Spec mentions tinted insulated glass getting work done in the store front and curtain wall adjacent to entry and walkways.to our understanding, these areas are not having any work done to them 	A9: Correct, no work on this area. Q10: The caulking is mentioned as being required on every window, starting with the C-wing and working in a clockwise direction from the top down.  Does this actually refer to the way it sounds, starting at the top and working clockwise and coming down as we complete each level meaning that scaffolding and or swings would need to be moved as we progress or can we start at C-wing top, work to ground floor, and then move to the next area at top, work to ground floor, and progress clockwise, completing each area, top to bottom before moving? 	A10: Either method is acceptable. Q11: Documents discuss not using elevators for moving materials.  How are materials such as for the plaster and paint repair going to be moved to ninth floor and so on and how is the glass window replacement materials expected to be reached to the 6th floor?  Via stairs? Crane? Or is their a service elevator which can be used? 	A11: There are Service elevators available Q12:  We saw what appeared to be damaged components on certain windows, i.e. locks, hinges, etc which is mentioned on page 28 of 30 of the spec document.  How do we know how many to provide when only a couple of interior windows were able to be shown to us? Do you have manufacturer/model information for all windows in the building which would require the repairs? 	A12: This work is not included in this project Q13: Can you confirm the width of the surgical wing hallway where the windows are to be replaced and the bulkhead is to have insulation added? 	A13: 9'-6&quot; Q14: Are we to assume all hallways as well as the surgical unit is to be up open throughout the entire process of this project? A14: We cannot block any door in this corridor.  However, the South West corner corridor may be closed from door to door.  All other areas need to remain open. Q15: How wide of an opening has to be left if a containment wall must be build to divide patient/employee use in the hallway vs. contractor side while working on the designated areas? A15: Around the doors that lead into surgery rooms there needs to be 8' of space open.  For the remaining hallway 6' needs to remain open.  Q16: Is there anyway that one hallway section can be completely closed off while we do that span of windows?  (i.e. it appeared all surgical suites had entrances from both sides, can one side be sealed off so the entire hallway can be used during the progress on that section, then cleaned when finished, opened back up, and moved to the end, then moved to the other side??) A16: We cannot block any door in this corridor.  However, the South West corner corridor may be closed from door to door.  All other areas need to remain open. Q17: Due to the nature of the location of the windows to be replaced, is that work do be completed at night? If not, can the hallway setup (either containment wall or sealing off the particular hallway section) be done at night to eliminate dust and contaminants? A17: Work will be permitted to be done during the day as long as noise or vibrations, or any other disruptions from the construction do not interfere with the hospitals functions.  Note: the surgical area is sensitive to vibrations and noise.  Work may be done at night to accommodate contractor/Hospital. Q18: For repairing of the interior of each window: a.	It was discussed at the site visit that the inside of EVERY window needs replaced.  Is this how you want it bid or do you want a set number of interior wall repairs included? A18a: Yes, every window for floors 9, 8, and 7.   b.	If a set number included, do you want a unit price for additional rooms which a government rep can determine and direct? A18b:  Yes c.	How many rooms are to be worked on at a time? (i.e. how many individuals do you want inconvenienced at a time vs how fast to you want the project completed?) A18c:  Project completion times are on bid items.  All work to be done in evenings, 10 rooms at a time. d.	How much space can be provided in each room while repairing the inside of the exterior wall? ( can everything be moved back away from the wall 4-5 feet while repairs are completed, and then moved back when complete?) A18d:  Patient rooms will have to be vacated before work is to begin.  All other rooms can have items moved away from window by contractor and are to be returned by 6 a.m. the next morning. e.	Are we to price painting each wall area from corner to corner for each wall which is to be repaired? A18e:  Yes Q19:  Are we talking about all the windows on the entire 9th floor? Does the caulking have to take place after the roof has been installed or can we caulk the windows while the crane is available during roof tear off instead of bringing the crane after tear off? 	A19: All windows on ninth floor are to be caulked. Caulking on the ninth floor can be placed while the crane is on site for the tear off of the roofs.
