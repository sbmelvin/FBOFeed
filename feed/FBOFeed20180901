<CONTACT>Max Kimpson, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-435-4380, Email Max.Kimpson@nih.gov
<DESC>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS. The Government's intent is TO AWARD A CONTRACT/PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION.<br />The National Institute of Health, Eunice Kennedy Shriver - National Institute of Child Health &amp; Human Development in support of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) intends to award a purchase order without providing for full and open competition the replacement of scientific systems and software related to the Human Energy and Body Weight Regulation Core Whole-room Indirect Calorimeters. The project background is as follows:
<p>The Human Energy and Body Weight Regulation Core in the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) currently has an outdated version of the software required to recorded data from the whole-room indirect calorimeters. The original software version was purchased in 2010 and upgraded last in 2012. The new software includes additional functionality, and is compatible with newer computer operating systems (Windows 7 or newer). Additionally, several electronic components needed for data acquisition (purchased prior to 2010) are beginning to malfunction and are obsolete. The requirement also includes equipment calibration, on-demand follow up support for 1 year after installation, and additional support for logging data from cycle ergometers used in current studies.</p>
<p>The primary focus of the Human Energy and Body Weight Regulation Core is to determine physiological factors that influence human metabolism which requires a wide array of devices to monitor various physiological systems. The three whole-room indirect calorimeters in the NIH clinical center are our primary instruments to measure human metabolism over periods from 5-24 hours. We are one of a handful (~25) sites worldwide with these instruments. Metabolic rate data measured by the calorimeters serve as the primary endpoint in most of the studies supported by the Metabolic Research Unit, which includes studies from multiple NIH institutes. <br />Our current software and data acquisition system for the whole-room indirect calorimeters was installed in 2010 and upgraded in 2012 by MEI Research Ltd, who is currently the only known US company to support these instruments. The software and acquisition system has functioned well over the past 6 years. But in the past few months we have experienced some problems with the data acquisition system and computer running the software. To remedy these issues, we must replace several of the acquisition components which are no longer manufactured and this also requires changes to the software. The software must also be upgraded to keep up with newer Windows operating systems. <br />The prospective contractor will upgrade the software and data acquisition system and perform all necessary instrument calibrations to continue to use the whole-room indirect calorimeters in on-going and upcoming protocols.</p>
<p>The prospective contractor is Mei Research Limited 6016 Schaefer Road, Edina, MN 55436. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334516 with a size standard of 1000 employees. The resultant award will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) <br />This acquisition is conducted under the procedures prescribed in FAR subpart 13- Simplified Acquisitions Procedures at an amount less than the simplified acquisition threshold ($250,000.00) and as supplemented by FAR Part 12 - Commercial Items. This acquisition is conducted under the authority of 41 U.S.C.253&copy; under provisions of the statutory authority of FAR Subpart 6.302-FAR 6.302-1- Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements 41 U.S.C. 253c (1). This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this notice. Responses to this notice shall contain sufficient information to established the interested parties bona-fide capabilities for fulfilling the requirement and include: certification by the OEM that you are authorized to provide services, unit price, list price, shipping and handling costs, the delivery period after contract award, the prompt payment discount terms, the F.O.B. Point ( Destination or Origin), the Duns &amp; Bradstreet Number (DUNS), the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and certification of business size.

<DESC>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS. The Government's intent is TO AWARD A CONTRACT/PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION.<br />The National Institute of Health, Eunice Kennedy Shriver - National Institute of Child Health &amp; Human Development in support of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) intends to award a purchase order without providing for full and open competition the acquisition of PanLab Infrared &reg; Actimeter. The project background is as follows:
<p>The Panlab Infrared (IR) Actimeter allows the study of spontaneous locomotor activity, rearings and optionally hole-board test parameters for exploration in rodents. A reliable system for easy and rapid drug screening and phenotype characterisation in both day and night lighting conditions.<br />The system is basically composed by a 2 dimensional (X and Y axes) square frame, a frame support and a control unit. Each frame counts with 16 x 16 infrared beams for optimal subject detection.<br />The system is completely modular: each frame may be used for evaluation of general activity (one or several animals), locomotor and stereotyped movements or rearings or exploration (nose-spoke detection in the hole-board option). The infrared photocell system can be set with up to 15 levels of sensitivity in order to adapt the frames to the typology of the animal (rats, mice). It can also be set to ignore the beams that are obstructed by objects (e.g. the walls/corners of the home cage).<br />The frames can be controlled by the independent control units LE8825 or directly through the optional SEDACOM computer software. The new SEDACOM 2.0 version provides an easy and convenient way to visualize and export the data on a computer for further analysis.<br />Optionally, the ActiTrack software option may be used to analyse animal trajectories (distance, speed, permanence time in selected zones) and then provide additional complementary data to those obtained using the control units.<br />The modular design of the Actimeter system creates the following important advantages for our experimental uses:<br />1. ad hoc created subsets of the arenas can be used by multiple researchers at the same time without interfering or endangering the data acquisition<br />2. the acquisition arena can be removed from the infrared beam frame and replaced by home or other cages for long term activity monitoring and easy cleaning, and lastly<br />3. the independent nature of each arena means that each arena has its own, independent data logger, independent from a common acquisition computer. This will ensure data integrity and minimize data loss, because a faulty or failing computer has no effect on the acquired data. <br />The manufacturer is Harvard Bioscience Inc., 84 October Hill Road #10, Holiston, MA 01746. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334516 with a size standard of 1000 employees. The resultant award will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) <br />This acquisition is conducted under the procedures prescribed in FAR subpart 13- Simplified Acquisitions Procedures at an amount less than the simplified acquisition threshold ($250,000.00) and as supplemented by FAR Part 12 - Commercial Items. This acquisition is conducted under the authority of 41 U.S.C.253&copy; under provisions of the statutory authority of FAR Subpart 6.302-FAR 6.302-1- Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements 41 U.S.C. 253c (1). This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this notice. Responses to this notice shall contain sufficient information to established the interested parties bona-fide capabilities for fulfilling the requirement and include: certification by the OEM that you are authorized to provide services, unit price, list price, shipping and handling costs, the delivery period after contract award, the prompt payment discount terms, the F.O.B. Point ( Destination or Origin), the Duns &amp; Bradstreet Number (DUNS), the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and certification of business size. All offerors must have an active registration in the System for Award Management (SAM) www.sam.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The information received will normally be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to proceed on a non-competitive basis or to conduct a competitive procurement. All responses to this notice shall be submitted electronically by 12:00 PM Eastern Standard Time Wednesday, September 12, 2018 to Maxwell J. Kimpson at email address max.kimpson@nih.gov.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS. The Government's intent is TO AWARD A CONTRACT/PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION.<br />The National Institute of Health, Eunice Kennedy Shriver - National Institute of Child Health &amp; Human Development in support of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) intends to award a purchase order without providing for full and open competition the acquisition of scientific equipment to process kidney biopsies (Next Generation). The project background is as follows:
<p>NIDDK has tried many unbiased approaches to identifying genes/proteins that are involved in kidney disease, and they have used the simplest means to isolate kidney tissue. Unfortunately, the kidney contains over two dozen cell types, and when we have validated candidate genes, we have found that changes in that gene depend on what cell types different changes occur. Because most meaningful changes occur either in a minority of cells, or even a rare subpopulation of cells, we are most likely missing some important changes in genes/proteins. The solution to this problem is to use single cell analysis, where we analyze each cell individually so that we can see signals from cells that may be a small fraction of the total cell mass of the kidney.</p>
<p>NIDDK is testing new ways to process kidney biopsies, isolating the heterogeneous kidney tissue into single cells. We will then analyze the cells by NexGen sequencing, and to analyze cells individually, the Chromium controller will generate droplets that contain one gel bead (that has a unique oligonucleotide bar code) for each cell. Further, we may pursue some technology development on the Chromium platform.</p>
<p>The manufacturer is 10X Genomics Inc., 7068 Koll Center Parkway Suite #401, Pleasanton, CA 94566. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334516 with a size standard of 1000 employees.

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p><br />BACKGROUND - The National Institute on Aging (NIA) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), conducts and funds various longitudinal and clinical studies on aging that generate or have generated a collection of biological specimens (biospecimens) and related phenotypic and clinical data/resources pertaining to these research activities. The NIA's Division of Geriatrics and Clinical Gerontology is establishing the NIA Central Biorepository to provide a state-of-the-art inventory system for the storage and distribution of biospecimens and related resources. All of these activities are in support of future research initiatives.  The collection of patient and control biospecimens from many different studies in a single repository is a valuable resource with which researchers can more rapidly validate clinical hypotheses and algorithms for clinical decision making. These collections will considerably contribute to advancing the development of prognostics, markers, and therapeutics for conditions related to aging and to a better understanding of the aging process.</p>
<p>Biospecimens are generally received as bulk relocations at the end of a study, but partial relocations or some intermittent shipping from potential ongoing studies may occur. The total estimated amount of biospecimens involved in this requirement is approximately 1,739,255 including: serum (400,102); plasma (138,161); urine (1,166,623); genetic materials such as DNA (9,905), buccal cells (1,912), and Epstein Barr virus cells and cell pellets (22,552).  All of these collected during the conduction of studies supported by NIA.</p>
<p>The biospecimens to be stored in the NIA Central Biorepository were collected over many years from studies that carefully selected subjects and are available in a finite quantity. Each biospecimen is unique and cannot be replaced if lost, damaged, or contaminated. It is very important that these biospecimens be stored under optimal conditions, which vary from type to type of biospecimen.</p>

The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.

All of these, collected during the conduction of studies supported by NIA.</p>
<p>The Data Coordination and Systems Management will serve as a data coordinating center to facilitate efficient distribution of data-related to biospecimens. As an archive and distributor of highly usable datasets, the Data Coordination and Systems Management also allows re-analysis of these data and, where relevant, of specific biospecimens, thus encouraging work by investigators at different levels of development, those proposing novel approaches, and others not included in the originally funded studies.</p>
<p>The Contractors responsible for the NIA Central Biorepository Data Coordination and Systems Management and for the NIA Central Biorepository Biological Specimens Storage shall collaborate to develop tools to facilitate management and use of the NIA Central Biorepository resources.</p>
<p>The information systems and database archiving tasks outlined in this statement of work (SOW) are highly technical, and require extensive experience. The data from each study represent the efforts of hundreds of investigators to improve the public health through biomedical research, and the voluntary participation of thousands of patients and family members. The data and samples also represent taxpayer funded work by NIH and it is important that these be made available to qualified researchers for the public benefit. The data cannot be replaced without great expense and effort, and, therefore, it is essential that they be protected from loss, damage, or misuse.</p>
<p>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES - The main objective of this requirement is to establish the NIA Central Biorepository Data Coordination and Systems Management component to accomplish the following in a highly efficient, rapid, secure, and cost-effective manner:</p>
<p>&bull; Planning and logistics to ensure provision of a technical and administrative infrastructure that supports efficient planning, initiation, implementation, and management of the NIA Central Biorepository activities.<br />&bull; Assure data integrity while acquiring, storing and distributing scientifically valuable human data related to biospecimens from NIA-funded studies.<br />&bull; Test the validity of electronic databases from completed or ongoing studies, and maintain the stored databases.<br />&bull; Curate data to derive study metadata and descriptive variables that permit Web-based searches of the entire inventory using keywords and other features of biospecimens or samples and datasets.<br />&bull; Carry out activities to support cross-listing of sample inventory with other national and international sample catalogues, when applicable or upon request.<br />&bull; Provide guidance, if needed, to investigators transferring their data to the NIA Central Biorepository by setting up labeling systems to cross-reference samples and associated data.<br />&bull; Develop and maintain a secure website for the NIA Central Biorepository, which shall include an online process for the submission and review of research applications requesting biospecimens and related data/resources, as well as submission of applications for inclusion of new collections in the NIA Central Biorepository.<br />&bull; Maintain a searchable, up-to-date central inventory of samples/data kept at the NIA Central Biorepository and provide inventory reporting structures for individual studies. <br />&bull; Create and maintain a searchable inventory of informed consents associated with each sample or study, if needed or as directed by the NIA Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).<br />&bull; Provide timely and informative analyses of databases in response to researcher inquiries about availability of appropriate samples and data.<br />&bull; Provide a system for requesting databases and/or samples, and or distribution of databases and/or stored samples to investigators granted access by the NIA COR.<br />&bull; Provide and implement Quality Assurance/Quality Control Programs or Systems for prospective evaluation of short and long-term data coordination and systems management.<br />&bull; Support the work of the NIA Central Biorepository Steering Committee (SC) and the Scientific Review Committees (SRC).</p>
<p>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS - See attached draft Statement of Work for specific work to be performed.</p>

A favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of the Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program prior to contract award or made within 60 days of incorporation of this clause into a current/existing contract.

If an unfavorable final background investigation determination is made, the purchase order may be terminated and the employee in question shall not be authorized to provide service to the BIA, OIEP, if the services involve contact with or regular control over Indian children.<BR><BR>See attachment for Full text<BR><BR>

NOAA prohibits sexual assault and sexual harassment by or of any employee, supervisor, manager, contractor, vendor, affiliate, or other individual with whom NOAA employees come into contact by the virtue of their work for NOAA.<br />(a) Definitions.<br />Contractor Employees - The term "contractor employees," as used in this solicitation and contract language, refers to employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members.<br />Sexual Assault - The term sexual assault, as used in this solicitation and contract language, means any conduct proscribed by state or federal sexual abuse laws, including, but not limited to, those defined in chapter 109A of title 18 of the U.S. Code (sexual abuse), and assaults committed both by offenders who are strangers to the victim and by offenders who are known or related by blood or marriage to the victim.<br />Sexual Harassment - As defined by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination that violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, non-verbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature when any of the following are true:<br />&bull; Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly as a term or condition of an individual's employment;<br />&bull; Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual;<br />&bull; The conduct unreasonably interferes with an individual's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.<br />The main characteristics of sexual harassment are that the harasser's conduct is targeted against the recipient's sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation, and is unwelcome to the recipient. It may include, but is not limited to: offensive jokes, slurs, epithets or name calling, undue attention, physical assaults or threats, unwelcome touching or contact, intimidation, ridicule or mockery, insults or put-downs, constant or unwelcome questions about an individual's identity, and offensive objects or pictures.<br />Attachment 1 AA 18-06<br />2<br />(b) Requirements.<br />1. It is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure that contractor employees maintain the highest degree of conduct and standards in performance of the contract. In support of<br />this, NOAA urges its contractors to develop and enforce comprehensive company policy addressing sexual assault and sexual harassment.<br />2. The contractor shall include wording substantially the same as this solicitation and contract language in every subcontract so that it is binding upon each subcontractor.<br />3. If a contractor employee observes or is the object of sexual assault or sexual harassment, he or she is highly encouraged to report the matter, as soon as possible, to their<br />immediate supervisor, the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), subset of the COR (e.g. Task Manager or Assistant COR), or contracting officer (CO) if a COR is not assigned to the contract. The contract employee may also contact the NOAA Civil Rights Office to obtain guidance on reporting instances of sexual assault or sexual harassment. If deemed necessary, the contractor employee may also report such instances to local law enforcement. In the case where the incident occurs while performing at a remote location, such as at sea or in the field (at a field camp or other isolated location) where the above referenced individuals are unavailable, the contractor employee should follow the reporting procedure set forth in NAO 202-1106, Section 6,<br />.07, Reporting from Remote Locations.<br />i. Swift reporting allows NOAA and the contractor to take the appropriate measures to ensure that offensive behavior stops and the complainants' needs are addressed.<br />ii. The COR (if assigned), CO, and contractor, where applicable, will work together to ensure appropriate action is taken in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, contract terms and conditions, and the contractor's written policy (where applicable).<br />4. The contractor shall provide all contractor employees assigned to perform under this contract with mandatory sexual assault and sexual harassment prevention and response training in compliance with the requirements of NAO 202-1106, Section 5, Prevention Training and Awareness, as part of their initial in-processing and on an annual basis thereafter. The initial training shall be completed within business days [30 unless a different number is inserted] of contract award or the date a contractor employee is assigned to perform under the contract, as applicable.<br />Evidence of initial training by name and date completed for each contractor employee, shall be submitted to the COR or contracting officer (if no COR assigned) within 10 business days of completion.<br />Evidence of annual training by name and date completed for each contractor employee shall be submitted to the COR or contracting officer (if no COR assigned) no later than March 1st of each calendar year of contract performance.<br />i. The mandatory sexual assault and sexual harassment training provided by the contractor shall include the required elements set forth by NOAA's Workplace Attachment 1 AA 18-06<br />3<br />Violence Program Manager. A link to the website including the required elements of the training is provided at: http://www.ago.noaa.gov/quicklinks/harassment_training.html. The website will also provide training materials and resources to assist the contractor in conducting the training. The contractor may provide training that solely addresses the NOAA required elements or may supplement existing company sexual assault and sexual harassment training in a manner that ensures all of the elements are adequately addressed.<br />ii. The required elements of the training and resources available to the contractor for the training may be updated by NOAA periodically. The contractor is responsible for monitoring the website and incorporating any changes to the NOAA required<br />elements into the contractor provided training.<br />iii. NOAA's Workplace Violence Program Manager, COR, or CO may periodically review the contractor's training outline to ensure all required elements are included and, if necessary, any appropriate adjustments are made to the training by the contractor.</p>
<p>iv. Contractor employees performing on assignments in a remote location, such as at a field camp or other isolated locations, are subject to receiving the same briefing on the parameters of the order provided to NOAA employees as set forth in Section 6 of NAO 202-1106.<br />5. The contractor shall provide a copy of this solicitation and contract language and NAO 202-1106 to contractor employees.</p>
<p>1330-52.237-70 Contractor Communications (Apr 2010)<br />CONTRACTOR COMMUNICATIONS<br />(a) A contractor employee shall be identified both by the individual's name and the contractor's name when:<br />1. Included in NOAA's locator, and<br />2. When submitting any type of electronic correspondence to any NOAA employee or stakeholder.<br />(b) Any written correspondence from a contractor or any contractor employee shall be printed on company/organization letterhead or otherwise clearly identify the sender as an employee of the company or organization and shall identify the contract number.<br />(c) Contractors and/or contractor employees shall clearly identify themselves as such in any verbal communications, whether in informal discussion or a formal meeting.<br />(End of Clause)</p>
<p>1330-52.237-71 NOAA Government-Contractor Relations - Non-Personal Services<br />NOAA GOVERNMENT-CONTRACTOR RELATIONS - NON-PERSONAL SERVICES CONTRACT (SEPT 2017)<br />(a) The Government and the contractor understand and agree that the services to be delivered under this contract by the contractor to the Government are non-personal services as defined in FAR Part 37, Service Contracting, and the parties recognize and agree that no employer-employee relationship exists or will exist under the contract between the Government and the contractor's personnel. It is, therefore, in the best interest of the Government to afford both parties an understanding of their respective obligations.<br />(b) Contractor personnel under this contract shall not:<br />1. Be placed in a position where they are under relatively continuous supervision and control of a Government employee.<br />2. Be placed in a position of command, supervision, administration, or control over Government personnel or over personnel of other contractors performing under other NOAA contracts.<br />(c) The services to be performed under this contract do not require the contractor or the contractor's personnel to exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Government. Rather, the contractor's personnel will act and exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the contractor.<br />(d) Rules, regulations, directives, and requirements that are issued by the Department of Commerce and NOAA under its responsibility for good order, administration, and security are applicable to all personnel who enter the Government installation and facilities, who are provided access to Government systems, or who travel on Government transportation. This is not to be construed or interpreted to establish any degree of Government control that is inconsistent with a non-personal services contract.<br />(e) Both parties are responsible for monitoring contract activities for indications of improper employee-employer relationships during performance. In the event a situation or occurrence takes place inconsistent with this contract language, the following applies:<br />1. The contractor shall notify the contracting officer in writing within 5 business days from the date of any situation or occurrence where the contractor considers specific contract activity to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language. The notice must include the date, nature and circumstance of the situation or occurrence, the name, function and activity of each Government employee or contractor employee involved or knowledgeable about the situation or occurrence, provide any documents or the substance of any oral communications related to the activity, and an estimated date by which the Government is recommended to respond to the notice in order to minimize cost, delay, or disruption of performance.<br />2. The contracting officer will review the information provided by the contractor, obtain additional information (if needed), and respond in writing as soon as practicable after receipt of the notification from the contractor. The contracting officer's response will provide a decision on whether the contracting officer determines the situation or occurrence to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language and, if deemed necessary, will specify any corrective action(s) to be taken in order to resolve the issue.<br />(End of solicitation and contract language)</p>
<p>1330-52.237-72 Contractor Access to NOAA Facilities<br />(a)<br />1. NOAA may close and or otherwise deny contractor employees access to a NOAA facility for a portion of a business day or longer for various reasons including, but not limited, to the following events:<br />2. The performance of this contract requires employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members ("contractor employees") to have access to and to the extent authorized, mobility within, a NOAA facility.<br />i. Federal public holidays for Federal employees in accordance with 5<br />U.S.C. 6103;<br />ii. Fires, floods, earthquakes, and unusually severe weather, including but not limited to snow storms, tornadoes, and hurricanes;<br />iii. Occupational safety or health hazards;<br />iv. Lapse in Appropriations; or<br />v. Federal Statute, Executive Order, Presidential Proclamation, or any other unforeseen reason.<br />3. In such events, the contractor employees may be denied access to a NOAA facility that is ordinarily available for the contractor to perform work or make delivery, as required by the contract.<br />(b) In all instances where contractors are denied access or required to vacate a NOAA facility, in part or in whole, the contractor shall be responsible to ensure contractor personnel working under the contract comply. If the circumstances permit, the contracting officer will provide direction to the contractor, either directly or through the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), which could include continuing on-site performance during the NOAA facility closure period; however, if Government oversight is required and is not available, on-site performance shall not be allowed. In the absence of such direction, the contractor shall exercise sound judgment to minimize unnecessary contract costs and performance impacts, for example, performing required work off- site if possible or reassigning personnel to other activities if appropriate.<br />(c) The contractor shall be responsible for monitoring the Office of Personnel Management at opm.gov, the local radio, television stations, NOAA web sites, and other communication channels. Once the facility is accessible, the contractor shall resume contract performance as required by the contract.<br />(d) For the period that NOAA facilities were not accessible to contractors who required access in order to perform the services, the contracting officer may-<br />1. Adjust the contract performance or delivery schedule for a period equivalent to the period the NOAA facility was not accessible;<br />2. Forego the work; or<br />3. Reschedule the work by mutual agreement of the parties.<br />(e) Notification procedures of a NOAA facility closure, including contractor denial of access, are as follows:<br />1. The contractor shall be responsible for notification of its employees of the NOAA facility closure to include denial of access to the NOAA facility. The dismissal of NOAA employees in accordance with statute and regulations providing for such dismissals shall not, in itself, equate to a NOAA facility closure in which contractors are denied access. Moreover, the leave status of NOAA employees shall not be conveyed or imputed to contractor personnel. Accordingly, unless a NOAA facility is closed and the contractor is denied access to the facility, the contractor shall continue performance in accordance with the contract.<br />2. Access to Government facilities and resources, including equipment and systems, will be limited and personnel necessary to administer contract performance may not be available. Generally, supply and service contracts that are funded beyond the date of the lapse in appropriation and do not require access to Government facilities, active administration by Government personnel or the use of Government resources in a manner that would cause the Government to incur additional obligations during the lapse in appropriation may continue. If a delivery date for a contract falls during the period of a lapse in appropriations, Government personnel may not be available to receive delivery. Contractors are directed to consult with a contracting officer before attempting to make a delivery. Contracting officers will be available throughout the lapse in appropriation period to provide guidance.<br />Once OMB guidance is given, CORs, in consultation with the contracting officer, will notify those contractors that are deemed by the Program Office to be performing excepted work and identify the contractor personnel requiring access to NOAA facilities. CORs will also coordinate with directly with facility management or physical security personnel at respective locations to ensure that the names of contractor personnel requiring access to Government facilities during the lapse in appropriations are provided to physical security personnel.<br />Contractors who are not designated as performing excepted work are not allowed access to Government facilities or to utilize Government resources in a manner that would incur any additional obligation of funding on behalf of the Government during the lapse in appropriation.<br />3. Unless otherwise specified within the contract award, contractors requiring access to NOAA facilities outside normal business hours or outside the normal workweek shall submit a written request in writing through the COR to the contracting officer. The written request shall provide justification supporting the required access and be submitted hours/days (contracting officer insert number of days. If blank, 72 hours applies) before access to the NOAA facility is needed.<br />(End of solicitation and contract language)</p>
<p>1330-52.243-70 Requests for Equitable Adjustment<br />(a) The amount of any request for equitable adjustment to contract terms shall accurately reflect the contract adjustment for which the Contractor believes the Government is liable. The request shall include only costs for performing the change. All indirect costs included in the request shall be properly allocable to the change in accordance with applicable acquisition regulations.<br />(b) Any request for equitable adjustment to contract terms that exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold shall bear, at the time of submission, the following certificate executed by an individual authorized to certify the request on behalf of the Contractor:<br />I certify that the request is made in good faith, and that the supporting data are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.<br />(Official's Name)<br />(Title)<br />(c) The certification in paragraph (b) of this clause requires full disclosure of all relevant facts, including:<br />(1) Certified cost or pricing data, if required, in accordance with subsection 15.403-4 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR); and<br />(2) Data other than certified cost or pricing data, in accordance with subsection 15.403-3 of the FAR, including actual cost data and data to support any estimated costs, even if certified cost or pricing data are not required.<br />(d) The certification requirement in paragraph (b) of this clause does not apply to:<br />(1) Requests for routine contract payments; for example, requests for payment for accepted supplies and services, routine vouchers under a cost-reimbursement type contract, or progress payment invoices; or<br />(2) Final adjustments under an incentive provision of the contract. (End of solicitation and contract language)<br />1330-52.270-304 NOAA ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)<br />a. The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:<br />1. Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.<br />2. Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.<br />3. Identify constraints in transparency and process.<br />b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.<br />c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.<br />d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:<br />1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).<br />2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.<br />3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.<br />4. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.<br />5. The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.<br />6. The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.<br />7. The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).<br />e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.<br />f. The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.<br />f. Questions regarding this solicitation and contract shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>

<p>NOAA Acquisition Alert Notification<br />Contractor Access to NOAA Facilities (SEPT 2017)<br />(a)(1) The performance of this contract requires employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members ("contractor employees") to have access to and to the extent authorized, mobility within, a NOAA facility.<br />(2) NOAA may close and or otherwise deny contractor employees access to a NOAA facility for a portion of a business day or longer for various reasons including, but not limited, to the following events:<br />(i) Federal public holidays for federal employees in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 6103;<br />(ii) Fires, floods, earthquakes, and unusually severe weather, including but not limited to snow storms, tornadoes, and hurricanes;<br />(iii) Occupational safety or health hazards;<br />(iv) Lapse in Appropriations; or<br />(v) Federal Statute, Executive Order, Presidential Proclamation, or any other unforeseen reason.<br />(3) In such events, the contractor employees may be denied access to a NOAA facility that is ordinarily available for the contractor to perform work or make delivery, as required by the contract.<br />(b) In all instances where contractors are denied access or required to vacate a NOAA facility, in part or in whole, the contractor shall be responsible to ensure contractor personnel working under the contract comply. If the circumstances permit, the contracting officer will provide direction to the contractor, either directly or through the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), which could include continuing on-site performance during the NOAA facility closure period; however, if Government oversight is required and is not available, on-site performance shall not be allowed. In the absence of such direction, the contractor shall exercise sound judgment to minimize unnecessary contract costs and performance impacts, for example, performing required work off-site if possible or reassigning personnel to other activities if appropriate.<br />(c) The contractor shall be responsible for monitoring the Office of Personnel Management at www.opm.gov, the local radio, television stations, NOAA web sites, and other communication channels. Once the facility is accessible, the contractor shall resume contract performance as required by the contract.<br />(d) For the period that NOAA facilities were not accessible to contractors who required access in order to perform the services, the contracting officer may-<br />(1) Adjust the contract performance or delivery schedule for a period equivalent to the period the NOAA facility was not accessible;<br />(2) Forego the work; or<br />(3) Reschedule the work by mutual agreement of the parties.<br />(e) Notification procedures of a NOAA facility closure, including contractor denial of access, are as follows:<br />(1) The contractor shall be responsible for notification of its employees of the NOAA facility closure to include denial of access to the NOAA facility. The dismissal of NOAA employees in accordance with statute and regulations providing for such dismissals shall not, in itself, equate to a NOAA facility closure in which contractors are denied access. Moreover, the leave status of NOAA employees shall not be conveyed or imputed to contractor personnel. Accordingly, unless a NOAA facility is closed and the contractor is denied access to the facility, the contractor shall continue performance in accordance with the contract.<br />(2) Access to Government facilities and resources, including equipment and systems, will be limited and personnel necessary to administer contract performance may not be available. Generally, supply and service contracts that are funded beyond the date of the lapse in appropriation and do not require access to Government facilities, active administration by Government personnel or the use of government resources in a manner that would cause the government to incur additional obligations during the lapse in appropriation may continue. If a delivery date for a contract falls during the period of a lapse in appropriations, Government personnel may not be available to receive delivery. Contractors are directed to consult with a contracting officer before attempting to make a delivery. Contracting officers will be available throughout the lapse in appropriation period to provide guidance.<br />Once OMB guidance is given, CORs, in consultation with the contracting officer, will notify those contractors that are deemed by the Program Office to be performing excepted work and identify the contractor personnel requiring access to NOAA facilities. CORs will also coordinate with directly with facility management or physical security personnel at respective locations to ensure that the names of contractor personnel requiring access to government facilities during the lapse in appropriations are provided to physical security personnel.<br />Contractors who are not designated as performing excepted work are not allowed access to Government facilities or to utilize government resources in a manner that would incur any additional obligation of funding on behalf of the government during the lapse in appropriation.<br />(3) Unless otherwise specified within the contract award, contractors requiring access to NOAA facilities outside normal business hours or outside the normal workweek shall submit a written request in writing through the COR to the contracting officer. The written request shall provide justification supporting the required access and be submitted 72 hours/days (contracting officer insert number of days. <br />(End of Solicitation and Contract Language)<br />NOAA Government-Contractor Relations - Non-Personal Services Contract (SEPT 2017)<br />(a) The Government and the Contractor understand and agree that the services to be delivered under this contract by the Contractor to the Government are non-personal services as defined in FAR Part 37, Service Contracting, and the parties recognize and agree that no employer-employee relationship exists or will exist under the contract between the Government and the Contractor's personnel. It is, therefore, in the best interest of the Government to afford both parties an understanding of their respective obligations.<br />(b) Contractor personnel under this contract shall not:<br />(1) Be placed in a position where they are under relatively continuous supervision and control of a Government employee.<br />(2) Be placed in a position of command, supervision, administration, or control over Government personnel or over personnel of other Contractors performing under other NOAA contracts.<br />(c) The services to be performed under this contract do not require the Contractor or the Contractor's personnel to exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Government. Rather, the Contractor's personnel will act and exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Contractor.<br />(d) Rules, regulations, directives, and requirements that are issued by the Department of Commerce and NOAA under its responsibility for good order, administration, and security are applicable to all personnel who enter the Government installation and facilities, who are provided access to Government systems, or who travel on Government transportation. This is not to be construed or interpreted to establish any degree of Government control that is inconsistent with a non-personal services contract.<br />(e) Both parties are responsible for monitoring contract activities for indications of improper employee-employer relationships during performance. In the event a situation or occurrence takes place inconsistent with this contract language, the following applies:<br />(1) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing within 5 business days from the date of any situation or occurrence where the Contractor considers specific contract activity to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language. The notice must include the date, nature and circumstance of the situation or occurrence, the name, function and activity of each Government employee or Contractor employee involved or knowledgeable about the situation or occurrence, provide any documents or the substance of any oral communications related to the activity, and an estimated date by which the Government is recommended to respond to the notice in order to minimize cost, delay, or disruption of performance.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer will review the information provided by the Contractor, obtain additional information (if needed), and respond in writing as soon as practicable after receipt of the notification from the Contractor. The Contracting Officer's response will provide a decision on whether the Contracting Officer determines the situation or occurrence to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language and, if deemed necessary, will specify any corrective action(s) to be taken in order to resolve the issue.<br />(End of Solicitation and Contract Language)<br />NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)<br />a. The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:<br />1. Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.<br />2.

However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.<br />d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:<br />1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A&bull;76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).<br />2.

Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.<br />g. Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov. <br />(End of solicitation and contract language)<br />1330-52.222-70 NOAA Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Prevention and Response Policy (MAY 2018)<br />In accordance with NOAA Administrative Order (NAO) 202-1106, NOAA Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Prevention and Response Policy, it is the policy of NOAA to maintain a work environment free from sexual assault and sexual harassment. NOAA prohibits sexual assault and sexual harassment by or of any employee, supervisor, manager, contractor, vendor, affiliate, or other individual with whom NOAA employees come into contact by the virtue of their work for NOAA.<br />(a) Definitions.<br />Contractor Employees - The term "contractor employees," as used in this solicitation and contract language, refers to employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members.<br />Sexual Assault - The term sexual assault, as used in this solicitation and contract language, means any conduct proscribed by state or federal sexual abuse laws, including, but not limited to, those defined in chapter 109A of title 18 of the U.S. Code (sexual abuse), and assaults committed both by offenders who are strangers to the victim and by offenders who are known or related by blood or marriage to the victim.<br />Sexual Harassment - As defined by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination that violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, non-verbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature when any of the following are true:<br />&bull; Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly as a term or condition of an individual's employment;<br />&bull; Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual;<br />&bull; The conduct unreasonably interferes with an individual's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.<br />The main characteristics of sexual harassment are that the harasser's conduct is targeted against the recipient's sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation, and is unwelcome to the recipient. It may include, but is not limited to: offensive jokes, slurs, epithets or name calling, undue attention, physical assaults or threats, unwelcome touching or contact, intimidation, ridicule or mockery, insults or put-downs, constant or unwelcome questions about an individual's identity, and offensive objects or pictures.<br />(b) Requirements.<br />1. It is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure that contractor employees maintain the highest degree of conduct and standards in performance of the contract. In support of this, NOAA urges its contractors to develop and enforce comprehensive company policy addressing sexual assault and sexual harassment.<br />2. The contractor shall include wording substantially the same as this solicitation and contract language in every subcontract so that it is binding upon each subcontractor.<br />3. If a contractor employee observes or is the object of sexual assault or sexual harassment, he or she is highly encouraged to report the matter, as soon as possible, to their immediate supervisor, the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), subset of the COR (e.g. Task Manager or Assistant COR), or contracting officer (CO) if a COR is not assigned to the contract. The contract employee may also contact the NOAA Civil Rights Office to obtain guidance on reporting instances of sexual assault or sexual harassment. If deemed necessary, the contractor employee may also report such instances to local law enforcement. In the case where the incident occurs while performing at a remote location, such as at sea or in the field (at a field camp or other isolated location) where the above referenced individuals are unavailable, the contractor employee should follow the reporting procedure set forth in NAO 202-1106, Section 6,.07, Reporting from Remote Locations.<br />i. Swift reporting allows NOAA and the contractor to take the appropriate measures to ensure that offensive behavior stops and the complainants' needs are addressed.<br />ii. The COR (if assigned), CO, and contractor, where applicable, will work together to ensure appropriate action is taken in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, contract terms and conditions, and the contractor's written policy (where applicable).<br />4. The contractor shall provide all contractor employees assigned to perform under this contract with mandatory sexual assault and sexual harassment prevention and response training in compliance with the requirements of NAO 202-1106, Section 5, Prevention Training and Awareness, as part of their initial in-processing and on an annual basis thereafter. The initial training shall be completed within business days [30 unless a different number is inserted] of contract award or the date a contractor employee is assigned to perform under the contract, as applicable.<br />Evidence of initial training by name and date completed for each contractor employee, shall be submitted to the COR or contracting officer (if no COR assigned) within 10 business days of completion.<br />Evidence of annual training by name and date completed for each contractor employee shall be submitted to the COR or contracting officer (if no COR assigned) no later than March 1st of each calendar year of contract performance.<br />i. The mandatory sexual assault and sexual harassment training provided by the contractor shall include the required elements set forth by NOAA's Workplace Violence Program Manager. A link to the website including the required elements of the training is provided at: http://www.ago.noaa.gov/quicklinks/harassment_training.html. The website will also provide training materials and resources to assist the contractor in conducting the training. The contractor may provide training that solely addresses the NOAA required elements or may supplement existing company sexual assault and sexual harassment training in a manner that ensures all of the elements are adequately addressed.<br />ii. The required elements of the training and resources available to the contractor for the training may be updated by NOAA periodically. The contractor is responsible for monitoring the website and incorporating any changes to the NOAA required elements into the contractor provided training.<br />iii. NOAA's Workplace Violence Program Manager, COR, or CO may periodically review the contractor's training outline to ensure all required elements are included and, if necessary, any appropriate adjustments are made to the training by the contractor.<br />iv. Contractor employees performing on assignments in a remote location, such as at a field camp or other isolated locations, are subject to receiving the same briefing on the parameters of the order provided to NOAA employees as set forth in Section 6 of NAO 202-1106.<br />5. The contractor shall provide a copy of this solicitation and contract language and NAO 202-1106 to contractor employees.<br />(c) Sexual Assault/Sexual Harassment (SASH) Helpline.<br />For NOAA employees, affiliates, and contractors who have experienced sexual assault or sexual harassment, NOAA has established the NOAA Sexual Assault/Sexual Harassment (SASH) helpline. This helpline is designed to provide crisis intervention, referrals, and emotional support to those who are victims and/or survivors of sexual harassment or sexual assault within the workplace. Contractor employees may use the helpline to receive live, confidential, one-on-one support in an occurrence of sexual harassment or assault by a Federal Government employee.<br />All services are anonymous, secure, and available worldwide, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The NOAA SASH helpline is accessible through a variety of channels, including:<br />&bull; Phone: 1-866-288-6558<br />&bull; Website &amp; Online Chat: http://NOAASASHHelpline.org<br />&bull; Mobile App: NOAA SASH Helpline (available via iOS and Android App Stores)<br />&bull; Text: (202) 335-0265<br />(d) Confidentiality.<br />Any party receiving information from the filing of a complaint alleging sexual assault or sexual harassment, or while performing an investigation into such a complaint, shall keep the information confidential. "Confidentiality" means that the information shall only be shared with others who have a need to know the information to conduct their official duties.<br />(e) Remedies.<br />In addition to other remedies available to the Government, contractor employee violations of Federal requirements (e.g., law, statutes, executive orders, code, rules, regulations) applicable to sexual assault and sexual harassment and/or failure to complete the mandatory training set forth in this solicitation and contract language, may result in:<br />1. Requiring the Contractor to remove a contractor employee or employees from the performance of the contract;<br />2. Requiring the Contractor to terminate a subcontract;<br />3. Suspension of contract payments until the Contractor has taken appropriate remedial action;<br />4. Termination of the contract for default or cause, in accordance with the termination clause of this contract;<br />5. Suspension or debarment; or<br />6. Other appropriate action.

<DESC><p>COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION 1333ND18QNB640514 <br />X-ray Diffraction-Ring-Analysis (XRD-DRA) Detector</p>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 - Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested, and a separate written solicitation document will not be issued. This solicitation is being issued under the authority of FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.</p>
<p>This solicitation is a Request for Quotations (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-97 effective 08/22/2018.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 1,000 employees. This acquisition is being procured as full and open competition.</p>
<p>DELIVERY<br />The system must be delivered within 120 days of the date of award. The items shall be shipped F.O.B. Destination to: <br />Argonne National Laboratory<br />9700 S. Cass Avenue, bldg 433A002<br />Argonne, IL 60439, USA<br />Attn.: Dr. Jan Ilavsky, Physicist, X-Ray Science Division, Advanced Photon Source</p>
<p>FOB DESTINATION MEANS: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.</p>
<p>PAYMENT SCHEDULE<br />A payment schedule will be negotiated with the successful contractor. The Government prefers that the Contractor be paid in one lump sum payment upon successful completion of delivery, installation, training and demonstration of salient characteristics, however, partial payments are not the standard.</p>
<p>EVALUATION CRITERIA AND BASIS FOR AWARD</p>
<p>BEST VALUE: The Government intends to award one contract. Awards will be made to the offerors whose proposal conforms to the solicitation requirements; who are determined to be responsible in accordance with the FAR by possessing the financial and other capabilities to fulfill the requirements of the contract at the best value to the Government. Each proposal will be evaluated against the factors described below. An offeror's failure to address any factor may be considered indicative of the offeror's lack of understanding of the Government's requirements and may result in the offer being determined unacceptable. Proposals will be evaluated based on the factors identified below:</p>
<p>Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the requirements of the solicitation represents the best value to the Government price and other factors considered. The following non-priced factors are listed in descending order of importance: (1) Technical Capability (2) Past Performance and (3) Price. The non-priced factors, when combined are equally important to price.</p>
<p>1. COMPACT X-RAY DIFFRACTION-RING-ANALYSIS DETECTOR CAPABILITY</p>
<p>Evaluation of Capability shall be based on the information provided in the proposal. NIST will evaluate whether the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed system meets all of the minimum technical requirements (Note: If an offeror does not indicate whether its proposed system meets a certain technical requirement, NIST will be compelled to determine that it does not.) The overall evaluation will be based upon:</p>
<p>The contractor's ability to provide a compact, large-area 2D position-sensitive flat-panel X-ray detector for diffraction ring analysis (compact 2D flat-panel X-ray detector) meeting or exceeding the minimum specifications as defined in the Statement of Work.</p>
<p>Stronger consideration will be given to offers who exceed the numerical performance requirements in technical scope item 1: requirements 1-11 listed in the SOW, provided that requirement 12 is also satisfied, and the price differential is not more than 15 %.</p>
<p>2. PAST PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the Offeror's and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance information to determine its relevance to the current requirements and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past three years.</p>
<p>In assessing the offeror's past performance, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness and ability to control schedule of past work to determine the quality of service, and the extent to which the offeror has performed delivered the same or similar item. The Government reserves the right to evaluate past performance information from references other than those provided by the offeror. The Government will assign a neutral rating to offerors with no relevant past performance.</p>
<p>3. PRICE</p>
<p>The proposed price will be evaluated but not scored. The prices will be evaluated to determine whether the proposed prices are fair and reasonable in relation to the solicitation requirements. Proposed prices shall be entirely compatible with the technical quotations.</p>
<p>NIST intends to evaluate quotes and issue a contract based on the initial quotes received. Therefore, the Contractor's initial quote should contain the Contractor's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. NIST reserves the right to request revised quotes from, or negotiate final contract terms with, one or more, but not all, Contractors if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.</p>
<p>REQUIRED SUBMISSIONS<br />All Contractors shall submit the following:<br />1. For the purpose of evaluation of Technical Capability: Documentation that clearly demonstrates the quoted system's ability to meet all required specifications, all requirements of all Line Items and FOB Destination shipping including the following:<br />(i) Technical description or product literature for the quoted system. <br />(ii) Demonstration that the quoted system meets or exceeds each minimum requirement described in the statement of work by providing a citation to the relevant section of its technical description or additional information.</p>
<p>2. For the purpose of Past Performance: A list of references for whom the same or similar products have been provided within the past three years. The list of references should include, at a minimum:<br />a. Customer contact information for the reference cited;<br />b. Contract value; <br />c. A description of product provided which demonstrates its similarity to the subject requirements;<br />d. The date of delivery.</p>
<p>3. For the purpose of Price: Contractors shall provide pricing for the following line items. All equipment must be new. Used or remanufactured equipment will not be considered for award:<br />&#61656; Line Item 0001: Quantity one (1), 2D flat-panel X-ray detector meeting specifications set out in statement of work<br />&#61656; Line Item 0002: Documentation of factory testing<br />&#61656; Line Item 0003: Quantity one (1), Hard copy of standard operating procedure for detector</p>
<p>4. A completed version of all required solicitation provisions (see attached provisions/clauses document - required submissions highlighted in blue).</p>
<p>5. Any award resulting from this solicitation will contain the following statement: "The Government's terms and conditions, identified herein, shall be the prevailing terms and conditions governing this award. In the event of a conflict between the Government's and contractor's terms and conditions, the Government's terms and conditions take precedence." If the Contractor objects to any of the terms and conditions contained in this solicitation, the contractor shall state "The terms and conditions in the solicitation are acceptable to be included in the award document with the exception, deletion, or addition of the following:" [Contractor shall list exception(s) and rationale for the exception(s)]. It is the sole responsibility of the Contractor to identify in their quote any exceptions to the terms and conditions of the solicitation. If the contractor does not include such a statement, the submission of a quotation in response to this solicitation will be regarded as the Contractor's acceptance of the Government's terms and conditions for inclusion into the resultant purchase order as prevailing.</p>
<p>6. Contractors shall provide an active DUNS # for the System for Award Management (SAM) registration.</p>
<p>Please note that this procurement IS NOT being conducted under the GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) program or another Government-Wide Area Contract (GWAC). If a contractor submits a quotation based upon an FSS or GWAC contract, the Government will accept the quoted price. However, the terms and conditions stated herein will be included in any resultant Purchase Order, not the terms and conditions of the contractor's FSS or GWAC contract, and the statement required above shall be included in the quotation;</p>
<p>DUE DATE FOR QUOTATIONS<br />All quotations must be submitted via e-mail to Indira Scott, Contract Specialist at Indira.Scott@nist.gov. Submission must be received not later than 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Friday, 07 September 2018. A quotation shall be considered received when it is received in the electronic inbox of Heather Bauer not later than the date and time identified herein.<br />All questions regarding this notice must be submitted via e-mail to Indira.Scott@nist.gov by 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday, 04 September 2018. Questions submitted after this date may not be addressed by the Government prior to the quotation submission deadline.</p>

NOAA prohibits sexual assault and sexual harassment by or of any employee, supervisor, manager, contractor, vendor, affiliate, or other individual with whom NOAA employees come into contact by the virtue of their work for NOAA.<br />(a) Definitions.<br />Contractor Employees - The term "contractor employees," as used in this solicitation and contract language, refers to employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members.<br />Sexual Assault - The term sexual assault, as used in this solicitation and contract language, means any conduct proscribed by state or federal sexual abuse laws, including, but not limited to, those defined in chapter 109A of title 18 of the U.S. Code (sexual abuse), and assaults committed both by offenders who are strangers to the victim and by offenders who are known or related by blood or marriage to the victim.<br />Sexual Harassment - As defined by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination that violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, non-verbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature when any of the following are true:<br />&bull; Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly as a term or condition of an individual's employment;<br />&bull; Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual;<br />&bull; The conduct unreasonably interferes with an individual's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.<br />The main characteristics of sexual harassment are that the harasser's conduct is targeted against the recipient's sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation, and is unwelcome to the recipient. It may include, but is not limited to: offensive jokes, slurs, epithets or name calling, undue attention, physical assaults or threats, unwelcome touching or contact, intimidation, ridicule or mockery, insults or put-downs, constant or unwelcome questions about an individual's identity, and offensive objects or pictures.<br />Attachment 1 AA 18-06<br />2<br />(b) Requirements.<br />1. It is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure that contractor employees maintain the highest degree of conduct and standards in performance of the contract. In support of<br />this, NOAA urges its contractors to develop and enforce comprehensive company policy addressing sexual assault and sexual harassment.<br />2. The contractor shall include wording substantially the same as this solicitation and contract language in every subcontract so that it is binding upon each subcontractor.<br />3. If a contractor employee observes or is the object of sexual assault or sexual harassment, he or she is highly encouraged to report the matter, as soon as possible, to their<br />immediate supervisor, the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), subset of the COR (e.g. Task Manager or Assistant COR), or contracting officer (CO) if a COR is not assigned to the contract. The contract employee may also contact the NOAA Civil Rights Office to obtain guidance on reporting instances of sexual assault or sexual harassment. If deemed necessary, the contractor employee may also report such instances to local law enforcement. In the case where the incident occurs while performing at a remote location, such as at sea or in the field (at a field camp or other isolated location) where the above referenced individuals are unavailable, the contractor employee should follow the reporting procedure set forth in NAO 202-1106, Section 6,<br />.07, Reporting from Remote Locations.<br />i. Swift reporting allows NOAA and the contractor to take the appropriate measures to ensure that offensive behavior stops and the complainants' needs are addressed.<br />ii. The COR (if assigned), CO, and contractor, where applicable, will work together to ensure appropriate action is taken in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, contract terms and conditions, and the contractor's written policy (where applicable).<br />4. The contractor shall provide all contractor employees assigned to perform under this contract with mandatory sexual assault and sexual harassment prevention and response training in compliance with the requirements of NAO 202-1106, Section 5, Prevention Training and Awareness, as part of their initial in-processing and on an annual basis thereafter. The initial training shall be completed within business days [30 unless a different number is inserted] of contract award or the date a contractor employee is assigned to perform under the contract, as applicable.<br />Evidence of initial training by name and date completed for each contractor employee, shall be submitted to the COR or contracting officer (if no COR assigned) within 10 business days of completion.<br />Evidence of annual training by name and date completed for each contractor employee shall be submitted to the COR or contracting officer (if no COR assigned) no later than March 1st of each calendar year of contract performance.<br />i. The mandatory sexual assault and sexual harassment training provided by the contractor shall include the required elements set forth by NOAA's Workplace Attachment 1 AA 18-06<br />3<br />Violence Program Manager. A link to the website including the required elements of the training is provided at: http://www.ago.noaa.gov/quicklinks/harassment_training.html. The website will also provide training materials and resources to assist the contractor in conducting the training. The contractor may provide training that solely addresses the NOAA required elements or may supplement existing company sexual assault and sexual harassment training in a manner that ensures all of the elements are adequately addressed.<br />ii. The required elements of the training and resources available to the contractor for the training may be updated by NOAA periodically. The contractor is responsible for monitoring the website and incorporating any changes to the NOAA required<br />elements into the contractor provided training.<br />iii. NOAA's Workplace Violence Program Manager, COR, or CO may periodically review the contractor's training outline to ensure all required elements are included and, if necessary, any appropriate adjustments are made to the training by the contractor.<br /><br />iv. Contractor employees performing on assignments in a remote location, such as at a field camp or other isolated locations, are subject to receiving the same briefing on the parameters of the order provided to NOAA employees as set forth in Section 6 of NAO 202-1106.<br />5. The contractor shall provide a copy of this solicitation and contract language and NAO 202-1106 to contractor employees.<br /><br />1330-52.237-70 Contractor Communications (Apr 2010)<br />CONTRACTOR COMMUNICATIONS</p>
<p>(a) A contractor employee shall be identified both by the individual's name and the contractor's name when:<br />1. Included in NOAA's locator, and<br />2. When submitting any type of electronic correspondence to any NOAA employee or stakeholder.</p>
<p>(b) Any written correspondence from a contractor or any contractor employee shall be printed on company/organization letterhead or otherwise clearly identify the sender as an employee of the company or organization and shall identify the contract number.</p>
<p>(c) Contractors and/or contractor employees shall clearly identify themselves as such in any verbal communications, whether in informal discussion or a formal meeting.<br />(End of Clause)<br /><br />1330-52.237-71 NOAA Government-Contractor Relations - Non-Personal Services<br />NOAA GOVERNMENT-CONTRACTOR RELATIONS - NON-PERSONAL SERVICES CONTRACT (SEPT 2017)<br />(a) The Government and the contractor understand and agree that the services to be delivered under this contract by the contractor to the Government are non-personal services as defined in FAR Part 37, Service Contracting, and the parties recognize and agree that no employer-employee relationship exists or will exist under the contract between the Government and the contractor's personnel. It is, therefore, in the best interest of the Government to afford both parties an understanding of their respective obligations.</p>
<p>(b) Contractor personnel under this contract shall not:<br />1. Be placed in a position where they are under relatively continuous supervision and control of a Government employee.<br />2. Be placed in a position of command, supervision, administration, or control over Government personnel or over personnel of other contractors performing under other NOAA contracts.<br />(c) The services to be performed under this contract do not require the contractor or the contractor's personnel to exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Government. Rather, the contractor's personnel will act and exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the contractor.<br />(d) Rules, regulations, directives, and requirements that are issued by the Department of Commerce and NOAA under its responsibility for good order, administration, and security are applicable to all personnel who enter the Government installation and facilities, who are provided access to Government systems, or who travel on Government transportation. This is not to be construed or interpreted to establish any degree of Government control that is inconsistent with a non-personal services contract.</p>
<p>(e) Both parties are responsible for monitoring contract activities for indications of improper employee-employer relationships during performance. In the event a situation or occurrence takes place inconsistent with this contract language, the following applies:<br />1. The contractor shall notify the contracting officer in writing within 5 business days from the date of any situation or occurrence where the contractor considers specific contract activity to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language. The notice must include the date, nature and circumstance of the situation or occurrence, the name, function and activity of each Government employee or contractor employee involved or knowledgeable about the situation or occurrence, provide any documents or the substance of any oral communications related to the activity, and an estimated date by which the Government is recommended to respond to the notice in order to minimize cost, delay, or disruption of performance.<br />2. The contracting officer will review the information provided by the contractor, obtain additional information (if needed), and respond in writing as soon as practicable after receipt of the notification from the contractor. The contracting officer's response will provide a decision on whether the contracting officer determines the situation or occurrence to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language and, if deemed necessary, will specify any corrective action(s) to be taken in order to resolve the issue.<br />(End of solicitation and contract language)<br /><br />1330-52.237-72 Contractor Access to NOAA Facilities</p>
<p>(a)<br />1. NOAA may close and or otherwise deny contractor employees access to a NOAA facility for a portion of a business day or longer for various reasons including, but not limited, to the following events:<br />2. The performance of this contract requires employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members ("contractor employees") to have access to and to the extent authorized, mobility within, a NOAA facility.<br />i. Federal public holidays for Federal employees in accordance with 5<br />U.S.C. 6103;<br />ii. Fires, floods, earthquakes, and unusually severe weather, including but not limited to snow storms, tornadoes, and hurricanes;<br />iii. Occupational safety or health hazards;<br />iv. Lapse in Appropriations; or<br />v. Federal Statute, Executive Order, Presidential Proclamation, or any other unforeseen reason.<br />3. In such events, the contractor employees may be denied access to a NOAA facility that is ordinarily available for the contractor to perform work or make delivery, as required by the contract.<br />(b) In all instances where contractors are denied access or required to vacate a NOAA facility, in part or in whole, the contractor shall be responsible to ensure contractor personnel working under the contract comply. If the circumstances permit, the contracting officer will provide direction to the contractor, either directly or through the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), which could include continuing on-site performance during the NOAA facility closure period; however, if Government oversight is required and is not available, on-site performance shall not be allowed. In the absence of such direction, the contractor shall exercise sound judgment to minimize unnecessary contract costs and performance impacts, for example, performing required work off- site if possible or reassigning personnel to other activities if appropriate.</p>
<p>(c) The contractor shall be responsible for monitoring the Office of Personnel Management at opm.gov, the local radio, television stations, NOAA web sites, and other communication channels. Once the facility is accessible, the contractor shall resume contract performance as required by the contract.</p>
<p>(d) For the period that NOAA facilities were not accessible to contractors who required access in order to perform the services, the contracting officer may-<br />1. Adjust the contract performance or delivery schedule for a period equivalent to the period the NOAA facility was not accessible;<br />2. Forego the work; or<br />3. Reschedule the work by mutual agreement of the parties.</p>
<p>(e) Notification procedures of a NOAA facility closure, including contractor denial of access, are as follows:<br />1. The contractor shall be responsible for notification of its employees of the NOAA facility closure to include denial of access to the NOAA facility. The dismissal of NOAA employees in accordance with statute and regulations providing for such dismissals shall not, in itself, equate to a NOAA facility closure in which contractors are denied access. Moreover, the leave status of NOAA employees shall not be conveyed or imputed to contractor personnel. Accordingly, unless a NOAA facility is closed and the contractor is denied access to the facility, the contractor shall continue performance in accordance with the contract.<br />2. Access to Government facilities and resources, including equipment and systems, will be limited and personnel necessary to administer contract performance may not be available. Generally, supply and service contracts that are funded beyond the date of the lapse in appropriation and do not require access to Government facilities, active administration by Government personnel or the use of Government resources in a manner that would cause the Government to incur additional obligations during the lapse in appropriation may continue. If a delivery date for a contract falls during the period of a lapse in appropriations, Government personnel may not be available to receive delivery. Contractors are directed to consult with a contracting officer before attempting to make a delivery. Contracting officers will be available throughout the lapse in appropriation period to provide guidance.</p>
<p>Once OMB guidance is given, CORs, in consultation with the contracting officer, will notify those contractors that are deemed by the Program Office to be performing excepted work and identify the contractor personnel requiring access to NOAA facilities. CORs will also coordinate with directly with facility management or physical security personnel at respective locations to ensure that the names of contractor personnel requiring access to Government facilities during the lapse in appropriations are provided to physical security personnel.</p>
<p>Contractors who are not designated as performing excepted work are not allowed access to Government facilities or to utilize Government resources in a manner that would incur any additional obligation of funding on behalf of the Government during the lapse in appropriation.<br />3. Unless otherwise specified within the contract award, contractors requiring access to NOAA facilities outside normal business hours or outside the normal workweek shall submit a written request in writing through the COR to the contracting officer. The written request shall provide justification supporting the required access and be submitted hours/days (contracting officer insert number of days. If blank, 72 hours applies) before access to the NOAA facility is needed.<br />(End of solicitation and contract language)<br /><br />1330-52.243-70 Requests for Equitable Adjustment<br />(a) The amount of any request for equitable adjustment to contract terms shall accurately reflect the contract adjustment for which the Contractor believes the Government is liable. The request shall include only costs for performing the change. All indirect costs included in the request shall be properly allocable to the change in accordance with applicable acquisition regulations.<br />(b) Any request for equitable adjustment to contract terms that exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold shall bear, at the time of submission, the following certificate executed by an individual authorized to certify the request on behalf of the Contractor:<br />I certify that the request is made in good faith, and that the supporting data are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>
<p>(Official's Name)</p>
<p>(Title)</p>
<p>(c) The certification in paragraph (b) of this clause requires full disclosure of all relevant facts, including:<br />(1) Certified cost or pricing data, if required, in accordance with subsection 15.403-4 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR); and<br />(2) Data other than certified cost or pricing data, in accordance with subsection 15.403-3 of the FAR, including actual cost data and data to support any estimated costs, even if certified cost or pricing data are not required.<br />(d) The certification requirement in paragraph (b) of this clause does not apply to:<br />(1) Requests for routine contract payments; for example, requests for payment for accepted supplies and services, routine vouchers under a cost-reimbursement type contract, or progress payment invoices; or<br />(2) Final adjustments under an incentive provision of the contract.

<p>a. The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1. Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2. Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3. Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.<br />c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5. The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6. The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7. The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f. The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>

<p><br />NOAA Acquisition Alert Notification</p>
<p>Contractor Access to NOAA Facilities (SEPT 2017)</p>
<p>(a)(1) The performance of this contract requires employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members ("contractor employees") to have access to and to the extent authorized, mobility within, a NOAA facility.</p>
<p>(2) NOAA may close and or otherwise deny contractor employees access to a NOAA facility for a portion of a business day or longer for various reasons including, but not limited, to the following events:</p>
<p>(i) Federal public holidays for federal employees in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 6103;</p>
<p>(ii) Fires, floods, earthquakes, and unusually severe weather, including but not limited to snow storms, tornadoes, and hurricanes;</p>
<p>(iii) Occupational safety or health hazards;</p>
<p>(iv) Lapse in Appropriations; or</p>
<p>(v) Federal Statute, Executive Order, Presidential Proclamation, or any other unforeseen reason.</p>
<p>(3) In such events, the contractor employees may be denied access to a NOAA facility that is ordinarily available for the contractor to perform work or make delivery, as required by the contract.</p>
<p>(b) In all instances where contractors are denied access or required to vacate a NOAA facility, in part or in whole, the contractor shall be responsible to ensure contractor personnel working under the contract comply. If the circumstances permit, the contracting officer will provide direction to the contractor, either directly or through the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), which could include continuing on-site performance during the NOAA facility closure period; however, if Government oversight is required and is not available, on-site performance shall not be allowed. In the absence of such direction, the contractor shall exercise sound judgment to minimize unnecessary contract costs and performance impacts, for example, performing required work off-site if possible or reassigning personnel to other activities if appropriate.</p>
<p>(c) The contractor shall be responsible for monitoring the Office of Personnel Management at www.opm.gov, the local radio, television stations, NOAA web sites, and other communication channels. Once the facility is accessible, the contractor shall resume contract performance as required by the contract.</p>
<p>(d) For the period that NOAA facilities were not accessible to contractors who required access in order to perform the services, the contracting officer may-</p>
<p>(1) Adjust the contract performance or delivery schedule for a period equivalent to the period the NOAA facility was not accessible;</p>
<p>(2) Forego the work; or</p>
<p>(3) Reschedule the work by mutual agreement of the parties.</p>
<p>(e) Notification procedures of a NOAA facility closure, including contractor denial of access, are as follows:<br />(1) The contractor shall be responsible for notification of its employees of the NOAA facility closure to include denial of access to the NOAA facility. The dismissal of NOAA employees in accordance with statute and regulations providing for such dismissals shall not, in itself, equate to a NOAA facility closure in which contractors are denied access. Moreover, the leave status of NOAA employees shall not be conveyed or imputed to contractor personnel. Accordingly, unless a NOAA facility is closed and the contractor is denied access to the facility, the contractor shall continue performance in accordance with the contract.</p>
<p>(2) Access to Government facilities and resources, including equipment and systems, will be limited and personnel necessary to administer contract performance may not be available. Generally, supply and service contracts that are funded beyond the date of the lapse in appropriation and do not require access to Government facilities, active administration by Government personnel or the use of government resources in a manner that would cause the government to incur additional obligations during the lapse in appropriation may continue. If a delivery date for a contract falls during the period of a lapse in appropriations, Government personnel may not be available to receive delivery. Contractors are directed to consult with a contracting officer before attempting to make a delivery. Contracting officers will be available throughout the lapse in appropriation period to provide guidance.</p>
<p>Once OMB guidance is given, CORs, in consultation with the contracting officer, will notify those contractors that are deemed by the Program Office to be performing excepted work and identify the contractor personnel requiring access to NOAA facilities. CORs will also coordinate with directly with facility management or physical security personnel at respective locations to ensure that the names of contractor personnel requiring access to government facilities during the lapse in appropriations are provided to physical security personnel.</p>
<p>Contractors who are not designated as performing excepted work are not allowed access to Government facilities or to utilize government resources in a manner that would incur any additional obligation of funding on behalf of the government during the lapse in appropriation.</p>
<p>(3) Unless otherwise specified within the contract award, contractors requiring access to NOAA facilities outside normal business hours or outside the normal workweek shall submit a written request in writing through the COR to the contracting officer. The written request shall provide justification supporting the required access and be submitted 72 hours/days (contracting officer insert number of days. <br />(End of Solicitation and Contract Language)</p>
<p>NOAA Government-Contractor Relations - Non-Personal Services Contract (SEPT 2017)</p>
<p>(a) The Government and the Contractor understand and agree that the services to be delivered under this contract by the Contractor to the Government are non-personal services as defined in FAR Part 37, Service Contracting, and the parties recognize and agree that no employer-employee relationship exists or will exist under the contract between the Government and the Contractor's personnel. It is, therefore, in the best interest of the Government to afford both parties an understanding of their respective obligations.</p>
<p>(b) Contractor personnel under this contract shall not:</p>
<p>(1) Be placed in a position where they are under relatively continuous supervision and control of a Government employee.</p>
<p>(2) Be placed in a position of command, supervision, administration, or control over Government personnel or over personnel of other Contractors performing under other NOAA contracts.</p>
<p>(c) The services to be performed under this contract do not require the Contractor or the Contractor's personnel to exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Government. Rather, the Contractor's personnel will act and exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Contractor.</p>
<p>(d) Rules, regulations, directives, and requirements that are issued by the Department of Commerce and NOAA under its responsibility for good order, administration, and security are applicable to all personnel who enter the Government installation and facilities, who are provided access to Government systems, or who travel on Government transportation. This is not to be construed or interpreted to establish any degree of Government control that is inconsistent with a non-personal services contract.</p>
<p>(e) Both parties are responsible for monitoring contract activities for indications of improper employee-employer relationships during performance. In the event a situation or occurrence takes place inconsistent with this contract language, the following applies:</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing within 5 business days from the date of any situation or occurrence where the Contractor considers specific contract activity to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language. The notice must include the date, nature and circumstance of the situation or occurrence, the name, function and activity of each Government employee or Contractor employee involved or knowledgeable about the situation or occurrence, provide any documents or the substance of any oral communications related to the activity, and an estimated date by which the Government is recommended to respond to the notice in order to minimize cost, delay, or disruption of performance.</p>
<p>(2) The Contracting Officer will review the information provided by the Contractor, obtain additional information (if needed), and respond in writing as soon as practicable after receipt of the notification from the Contractor. The Contracting Officer's response will provide a decision on whether the Contracting Officer determines the situation or occurrence to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language and, if deemed necessary, will specify any corrective action(s) to be taken in order to resolve the issue.<br />(End of Solicitation and Contract Language)</p>

<p>1330-52.222-70 NOAA Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Prevention and Response Policy (MAY 2018)<br />In accordance with NOAA Administrative Order (NAO) 202-1106, NOAA Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Prevention and Response Policy, it is the policy of NOAA to maintain a work environment free from sexual assault and sexual harassment. NOAA prohibits sexual assault and sexual harassment by or of any employee, supervisor, manager, contractor, vendor, affiliate, or other individual with whom NOAA employees come into contact by the virtue of their work for NOAA.</p>
<p>(a) Definitions.</p>
<p>Contractor Employees - The term "contractor employees," as used in this solicitation and contract language, refers to employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members.</p>
<p>Sexual Assault - The term sexual assault, as used in this solicitation and contract language, means any conduct proscribed by state or federal sexual abuse laws, including, but not limited to, those defined in chapter 109A of title 18 of the U.S. Code (sexual abuse), and assaults committed both by offenders who are strangers to the victim and by offenders who are known or related by blood or marriage to the victim.</p>
<p>Sexual Harassment - As defined by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination that violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, non-verbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature when any of the following are true:</p>
<p>&bull; Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly as a term or condition of an individual's employment;<br />&bull; Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual;<br />&bull; The conduct unreasonably interferes with an individual's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.</p>
<p>The main characteristics of sexual harassment are that the harasser's conduct is targeted against the recipient's sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation, and is unwelcome to the recipient. It may include, but is not limited to: offensive jokes, slurs, epithets or name calling, undue attention, physical assaults or threats, unwelcome touching or contact, intimidation, ridicule or mockery, insults or put-downs, constant or unwelcome questions about an individual's identity, and offensive objects or pictures.<br />(b) Requirements.</p>
<p>1. It is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure that contractor employees maintain the highest degree of conduct and standards in performance of the contract. In support of this, NOAA urges its contractors to develop and enforce comprehensive company policy addressing sexual assault and sexual harassment.</p>
<p>2. The contractor shall include wording substantially the same as this solicitation and contract language in every subcontract so that it is binding upon each subcontractor.</p>
<p>3. If a contractor employee observes or is the object of sexual assault or sexual harassment, he or she is highly encouraged to report the matter, as soon as possible, to their immediate supervisor, the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), subset of the COR (e.g. Task Manager or Assistant COR), or contracting officer (CO) if a COR is not assigned to the contract. The contract employee may also contact the NOAA Civil Rights Office to obtain guidance on reporting instances of sexual assault or sexual harassment. If deemed necessary, the contractor employee may also report such instances to local law enforcement. In the case where the incident occurs while performing at a remote location, such as at sea or in the field (at a field camp or other isolated location) where the above referenced individuals are unavailable, the contractor employee should follow the reporting procedure set forth in NAO 202-1106, Section 6,.07, Reporting from Remote Locations.</p>
<p>i. Swift reporting allows NOAA and the contractor to take the appropriate measures to ensure that offensive behavior stops and the complainants' needs are addressed.<br />ii. The COR (if assigned), CO, and contractor, where applicable, will work together to ensure appropriate action is taken in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, contract terms and conditions, and the contractor's written policy (where applicable).</p>
<p>4. The contractor shall provide all contractor employees assigned to perform under this contract with mandatory sexual assault and sexual harassment prevention and response training in compliance with the requirements of NAO 202-1106, Section 5, Prevention Training and Awareness, as part of their initial in-processing and on an annual basis thereafter. The initial training shall be completed within business days [30 unless a different number is inserted] of contract award or the date a contractor employee is assigned to perform under the contract, as applicable.</p>
<p>Evidence of initial training by name and date completed for each contractor employee, shall be submitted to the COR or contracting officer (if no COR assigned) within 10 business days of completion.</p>
<p>Evidence of annual training by name and date completed for each contractor employee shall be submitted to the COR or contracting officer (if no COR assigned) no later than March 1st of each calendar year of contract performance.</p>
<p>i. The mandatory sexual assault and sexual harassment training provided by the contractor shall include the required elements set forth by NOAA's Workplace Violence Program Manager. A link to the website including the required elements of the training is provided at: http://www.ago.noaa.gov/quicklinks/harassment_training.html. The website will also provide training materials and resources to assist the contractor in conducting the training. The contractor may provide training that solely addresses the NOAA required elements or may supplement existing company sexual assault and sexual harassment training in a manner that ensures all of the elements are adequately addressed.<br />ii. The required elements of the training and resources available to the contractor for the training may be updated by NOAA periodically. The contractor is responsible for monitoring the website and incorporating any changes to the NOAA required elements into the contractor provided training.<br />iii. NOAA's Workplace Violence Program Manager, COR, or CO may periodically review the contractor's training outline to ensure all required elements are included and, if necessary, any appropriate adjustments are made to the training by the contractor.<br />iv. Contractor employees performing on assignments in a remote location, such as at a field camp or other isolated locations, are subject to receiving the same briefing on the parameters of the order provided to NOAA employees as set forth in Section 6 of NAO 202-1106.</p>
<p>5. The contractor shall provide a copy of this solicitation and contract language and NAO 202-1106 to contractor employees.</p>
<p>(c) Sexual Assault/Sexual Harassment (SASH) Helpline.</p>
<p>For NOAA employees, affiliates, and contractors who have experienced sexual assault or sexual harassment, NOAA has established the NOAA Sexual Assault/Sexual Harassment (SASH) helpline. This helpline is designed to provide crisis intervention, referrals, and emotional support to those who are victims and/or survivors of sexual harassment or sexual assault within the workplace. Contractor employees may use the helpline to receive live, confidential, one-on-one support in an occurrence of sexual harassment or assault by a Federal Government employee.<br />All services are anonymous, secure, and available worldwide, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The NOAA SASH helpline is accessible through a variety of channels, including:</p>
<p>&bull; Phone: 1-866-288-6558<br />&bull; Website &amp; Online Chat: http://NOAASASHHelpline.org<br />&bull; Mobile App: NOAA SASH Helpline (available via iOS and Android App Stores)<br />&bull; Text: (202) 335-0265</p>
<p>(d) Confidentiality.</p>
<p>Any party receiving information from the filing of a complaint alleging sexual assault or sexual harassment, or while performing an investigation into such a complaint, shall keep the information confidential. "Confidentiality" means that the information shall only be shared with others who have a need to know the information to conduct their official duties.<br />(e) Remedies.</p>
<p>In addition to other remedies available to the Government, contractor employee violations of Federal requirements (e.g., law, statutes, executive orders, code, rules, regulations) applicable to sexual assault and sexual harassment and/or failure to complete the mandatory training set forth in this solicitation and contract language, may result in:</p>
<p>1. Requiring the Contractor to remove a contractor employee or employees from the performance of the contract;<br />2. Requiring the Contractor to terminate a subcontract;<br />3. Suspension of contract payments until the Contractor has taken appropriate remedial action;<br />4. Termination of the contract for default or cause, in accordance with the termination clause of this contract;<br />5. Suspension or debarment; or<br />6. Other appropriate action.

<DESC>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS. The Government's intent is TO AWARD A CONTRACT/PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION.<br />The National Institute of Health, Eunice Kennedy Shriver - National Institute of Child Health &amp; Human Development in support of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) intends to award a purchase order without providing for full and open competition the acquisition of scientific equipment to process kidney biopsies (Next Generation). The project background is as follows:
<p>NIDDK has tried many unbiased approaches to identifying genes/proteins that are involved in kidney disease, and they have used the simplest means to isolate kidney tissue. Unfortunately, the kidney contains over two dozen cell types, and when we have validated candidate genes, we have found that changes in that gene depend on what cell types different changes occur. Because most meaningful changes occur either in a minority of cells, or even a rare subpopulation of cells, we are most likely missing some important changes in genes/proteins. The solution to this problem is to use single cell analysis, where we analyze each cell individually so that we can see signals from cells that may be a small fraction of the total cell mass of the kidney.</p>
<p>NIDDK is testing new ways to process kidney biopsies, isolating the heterogeneous kidney tissue into single cells. We will then analyze the cells by NexGen sequencing, and to analyze cells individually, the Chromium controller will generate droplets that contain one gel bead (that has a unique oligonucleotide bar code) for each cell. Further, we may pursue some technology development on the Chromium platform.</p>
