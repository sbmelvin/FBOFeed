<DESC>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to enter into a contract for the  development of new or improved influenza virus Point-of-Care (POC) diagnostic tests to an advanced stage development and facilitate early commercialization. Products for influenza testing should have high sensitivity and specificity, along with reliability, ease of use, low-cost, stability, and practicality for point-of-care use. These tests should have capability to detect all influenza viruses and initially differentiate influenza A (H5N1) viruses from other influenza A viruses, and be sufficiently quick and simple to provide preliminary results to healthcare providers within 30 minutes of collecting samples from persons with influenza-like illness.  The candidate test design should also permit capability to expand or modify biomarkers that are detected to enable adaptation for other novel influenza A viruses that may cause a pandemic.  Because of the uncertainty associated with appropriate sampling for pre-pandemic detection of novel influenza A viruses such as H5N1, the test system should also be adaptable to multiple sample types.  The completion of the work proposed in the contract should lead to availability of a diagnostic test product that provides improved sensitivity for detection of seasonal human influenza viruses in upper respiratory tract specimens, and also to differentiate H5N1 causing current human infections from seasonal human influenza viruses in both upper and lower respiratory tract specimens.  Because other novel influenza A viruses may also cause human infections at any time, the product must be easily modified or adapted to detect those emerging viruses.  Independently and not as an agent of the government, the Contractor shall furnish all the necessary services, qualified personnel, materials, equipment, and facilities not otherwise provided by the government as needed to perform the work described above.  Incremental funding for a cost-reimbursement type contract will be provided to support this effort.  A pre-proposal meeting/conference will be held prior to the due date for the receipt of proposals.  The date, time, and location for the pre-proposal meeting will be included in the solicitation.  RFP 2006-Q-08478 will be available on or about May 15, 2006.  The solicitation can be accessed through the internet at: http://www.fbo.gov.  Any amendment issued to the solicitation will also be made available at the same website.  It is the contractor’s responsibility to keep up with additional postings regarding this RFP on the FedBizOpps website.  Full and open competition will be used in soliciting offers for this requirement.  This procurement is not set-aside for small business.  All responsible sources may summit a proposal, which will be considered by the Agency.  Any questions/concerns about the RFP shall be submitted via e-mail to Jeff Miller at afx2@cdc.gov.

<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is soliciting proposals for a five-year (three years with one two-year extension option) reimbursable contract to establish an Innovations Clearinghouse that will be a database-driven, Internet-accessible, public clearinghouse of innovations in health service delivery. The Innovations Clearinghouse will facilitate collection of innovative health service practices and present them in a standardized format accompanied by expert commentary; promote their dissemination, replication, adaptation, and use; and, foster innovation in the U.S. health care service industry. 

Tasks will revolve around the development, deployment and maintenance of the processes and systems to collect, publish, update and archive innovations (in health service delivery), associated tools and lessons learned. The innovations will be entered and stored in a Contractor-constructed database; they will be posted to a Web site the Contractor will design, deploy and maintain for this project. Related tasks include establishment of an expert panel and an editorial board, development of criteria that innovative health service delivery practices must meet to be included in the Clearinghouse, and creation of a standardized template to capture innovations’ attributes. The expert panel will guide the Clearinghouse on broad project areas, and will participate in approval of the inclusion criteria and standardized template. The Web site will be user-centered and will meet requirements of the E-Government Act of 2002, including ensuring information quality, following Department-wide policies, communicating with the public and following the Paperwork Reduction Act, using an approved domain, implementing security controls, protecting privacy, maintaining accessibility, and managing records. In addition, online and offline opportunities for learning and networking among Innovations Clearinghouse users will be a component of this project. AHRQ’s QualityTools database and Web site (www.qualitytools.ahrq.gov) will become the responsibility of the Innovations Clearinghouse Contractor.  Eventually, the QualityTools database will be presented through the Innovations Clearinghouse Web site. 

Offerors must possess expertise in health service delivery innovation and change; implementation of evidence-based health practices; health care quality improvement or disparities reduction strategy implementation and evaluation; complex database and government Web-site development and maintenance; and, working with expert panels and editorial boards. To evaluate the Offeror’s expertise in the aforementioned areas, the information on the process to perform the work described below must be included in the proposal.  1.  Maintain AHRQ’s QualityTools database and Web site.  2. Establish a project expert panel that will provide feedback and guidance, and to establish an editorial board with capacity to review submissions and write expert commentary critiquing innovation successes and failures, offering insights and addressing the nuances of innovation, implementation, and change.  3. Develop and apply inclusion criteria related to health service delivery innovations.  4. Develop an innovations database template record; Stimulate, assist in generating, and collect a comprehensive accumulation of health service delivery innovations and lessons learned. 6.  Stimulate, assist in generating, and collecting a comprehensive accumulation of health service delivery innovations and lessons learned. 7.  Design the Innovations Clearinghouse Web site incorporating feedback provided on the existing QualityTools Web site, and develop, test, deploy, maintain, and evaluate this national Web-based repository of health care system and practice innovations, change initiatives, change packages, and associated tools and lessons learned; import QualityTools’ Web crawler feature with a redesigned interface to assist users in finding relevant innovations, change initiatives, packages and tools at specific, complementary Web sites for ‘one stop’ searching (or suggest an alternative Web crawler accompanied by rationale). 7. Emphasize innovations targeting public health priority diseases/conditions, priority populations, and efforts to reduce disparities in quality. 8.  Provide appropriate and timely technical assistance to users; and 9.  Provide dynamic opportunities for learning and networking among the users of the Web site 

The Innovations Clearinghouse is to be comprised of core staff of seasoned professionals with education and experience in areas such as operationalizing health service delivery innovation and change; implementing and evaluating health care quality improvement or disparities reduction strategies; educating and training adult professionals; evaluating and implementing evidence-based clinical information; constructing large relational databases; developing clinically-related classification schemes; and developing Web sites. A PMI-certified or PMI-certification eligible Project Manager is required as well as demonstrated ability to provide EVM information. In the event that the Innovations Clearinghouse core staff does not include particular expertise needed to accomplish a particular task, the Innovations Clearinghouse is to obtain such expertise through consultants and/or subcontracts.    

In addition to the solicitation being available on this site, it will be available for downloading from the internet on AHRQ’s site at http://ahrq.gov . Once in AHRQ’s homepage go to “Funding Opportunities”, then to “Contracts”, and then to “Request for Proposal (RFP)”. It is the offerors responsibility to monitor this site for release of the solicitation, download their own copy of the solicitation, and to monitor this site for any subsequent amendments.

<DESC>The Department of the Treasury’s Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD) on behalf of the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) intends to issue a solicitation for a contractor to perform Advertising Production Cost Analysis.
This acquisition is 100% set-aside for small business, the NAICS code is 541613 and the size standard is $6.5 million.  It is the government’s intent to award a contract from this solicitation with a base and 4 option periods.

ONDCP is seeking a Contractor with proven ability to provide pre- and post-production review of all cost estimates and invoices submitted for advertising associated with the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign. The Contractor, working with all Campaign partners as necessary, shall design a process which ensures that proposed and actual production costs assessed to the Government will be within industry standards for the type (format and length) of execution at public service rates, and in accordance with already established guidelines.  The Contractor shall describe any staffing necessary to perform the production review, with an emphasis on controlling costs and keeping internal management and review to a minimum.  

Creative needs are based upon specific campaigns and flighting schedules.  Campaigns usually consist of television, radio, print, and sometimes out-of-home advertising executions, including cinema.  Actual campaign deliverables are driven by the media buy.  Additionally, production jobs may consist of multiple ads within each category.

<DESC>THIS IS A COPY OF A LETTER SENT TO FIRMS WHICH PREVIOUSLY RESPONDED TO RFI DCCA-060024.  OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES ARE INVITED TO RESPOND TO THIS NOTICE.




Dear Sir or Madam:


Thank you for your interest in NSF Sources Sought Notice DCCA-060024, Ice-Breaking Services in Antarctica.  This Request for Information (RFI) is on the internet and may be viewed at:

http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=19175

Your input will help inform our discussions regarding the future of the U.S. polar icebreaking fleet.  In parallel, the National Academies of Science has constituted a special committee to review this issue and provide advice to the Government.  The website for that review may be viewed at:

http://www8.nationalacademies.org/cp/projectview.aspx?key=173

The RFI you responded to concerned icebreaking services.  Based on information gained from wide-ranging discussions on this topic, NSF now sees merit in seeking information concerning a complete re-supply package – for example, mated icebreakers and cargo/fuel supply vessels that can work in close tow configuration.  We may issue an RFI to that end but in the meantime, we invite your expression of interest in providing one or more aspects of such a system, and/or expressions of interest for teaming arrangements to implement such a system.

The package should include icebreaking with delivery of fuel, containers and break bulk to McMurdo Station, Antarctica, as well as the retrograde of materials from McMurdo Station to the U.S.  The nominal annual requirements are identified below and in the attached spread sheets. 

•	Fuel (gallons)
o	AN-8 3.5 million
o	JP-5 3.0 million
o	Gasoline 250 thousand

•	Containers (TEU): 600

•	Break Bulk (Pounds): 1.5 million

•	Retrograde
o	500 TEU
o	500,000 lbs break bulk

We would appreciate receiving responses by 4:00 PM on June 30, 2006.  However, we should advise you that we are seeking information only.  At present, we have not determined when, or if, we will seek these services.


Sincerely,						
						
Original Signed
						
Jillian M. Pate
Contracting Officer

<DESC>Description:  SUBJECT:  REPORT DETAILING FUNCTIONALITY OF GAS HYDRATE DATABASE SEARCH PORTAL DESC: The U.S. Department of Energyâ€™s National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA intends to award a purchase order on a sole-source basis to The Colorado School of Mines, Golden, Co to establish a portal providing free access to the non-proprietary international gas hydrate databases, so that parties interested in gas hydrate work can access multiple data sets around the world for information on gas hydrates.  The solicitation number is DE-RQ26-06NT00430. Statement of Work: This work, to develop a methane hydrate database portal, is the final step of a two step process to link gas hydrate international databases via a searchable portal site.  A database portal is an interface in which users (clients) can request and/or submit data to international hydrate databases for review and/or possible inclusion.  The portal enables routing of the clientâ€™s request to several databases, using a data categorization scheme known as the Gas Hydrate Markup Language (GHML).  Thus the portal is the second (and final) step enabling the connection of the user to the international databases (using the GHML developed in the first step).  The GHML categorization is being developed under a separately funded effort. This work will produce an active web-based hydrate portal (approved by CODATA international participants) which is open to the public for use in searching hydrate databases. A report detailing the functionality of the hydrate database search portal will be the deliverable of this work.  The report is to describe the functionality of the operating site including but not limited to:  how the site works, who can use the search portal, instructions for use (both for submission of and retrieval of hydrate data using the portal), description of how the portal links to the international hydrate databases being searched and a listing of the participating international hydrate databases that can be searched using the portal. THE FOLLOWING MILESTONES FOR THE PURCHASE ARE ANTICIPATED AS: 1.  DEVELOPMENT OF PORTAL BETA SPECIFICATIONS/REQUIREMENTS â€“ 31-DEC-2006. 2.  DEVELOPMENT OF 1ST BETA VERISON OF PORTAL â€“ 15-MAR-2007. 3.  CODATA COMMITTEE MEETING TO CRITIQUE BETA PORTAL â€“ 15-APR-2007. 4.  SUBMITTAL OF 2ND BETA VERSION OF PROTAL TO COMMITTEE â€“ 15-AUG-2007. 5.  FINAL COMMITTEE CRITIQUE/APPROVAL MEETING â€“ 01-NOV-2007. 6.  PORTAL INAUGURATION â€“ 31-DEC-2007. 7.

<SUBJECT>99--Short term 6-month bridge contract for Air Traffic Instructional Support Services.
<SOLNBR>DTFAAC-06-R-02043
<RESPDATE>051906
<ARCHDATE>06182006
<CONTACT>Brent Foreman, (405) 954-7894
<DESC>SYNOPSIS The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for a short-term bridge contract of 6-months to provide technical training to Air Traffic Control Specialists.  Technical training is provided for newly hired Air Traffic Control Specialists with specialized training to occupy staff positions at field facilities.  The Air Traffic Division also develops, revises, and maintains lesson plan materials used in all FAA ATC facilities.  This 6-month bridge contract will allow the FAA the administrative time necessary to put in place a long-term contract providing competitive bidding for a five (5) year contract.  This bridge contract will provide all contract personnel required to fulfill the training mission of the FAA Academy until such time as the follow-on can be awarded.  This bridge was necessary as the current contract is to expire on July 31, 2006.  The replacement contract was delayed in starting due to the development of the actual numbers of students that will be required to be trained over the next five years to meet the FAA Administrator's stated requirements to replace the current ageing air traffic work force.  In accordance with AMS 3.2.2.4, Single Source Selection, the Product Team responsible for this acquisition has determined that issuance of a bridge contract to The University of Oklahoma, College of Continuing Education, Norman, Oklahoma, the incumbent contractor that is currently supplying these services to the FAA, for an additional 6-month period, to be the only feasible method of continuing these critically required services.  Due to the urgent requirement to hire, train and replace an estimated 12,000 Air Traffic Controllers that will be retiring within the next five to seven years there can be no lapse in  training the new replacement Air Traffic Controllers.  To continue with the current vendor on a six-month bridge contract until such time as the competitive follow-on contract can be put in place is the only alternative available that will not cause a break in services to the FAA.  Any break in services could have a major impact on the FAA's ability to fill and staff critical Air Traffic Controller positions in Centers and Airports nationwide.  To not take this action could mean a restriction of take off and landings nationwide, unfilled seats in Air Traffic Centers and towers, and cause a reduction in the FAA's ability to serve the flying public.  The economics of this would have an impact on both the nation and its ability to commence trade worldwide.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 61170, Office Administrative Services with a size standard of is $6 million.  Any questions must be in writing to Brent D. Foreman, Contracting Officer, FAA, Aviation, Medical & Training Division, AMQ-310, P.O. Box 25082, Oklahoma City, OK 73125, Phone (405) 954-7894.

<DESC>The U. S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration intends to award a contract on a sole source basis to Dr. Paul Carlson from Texas Transportation Institute. The results of the proposed consolidation, review and analysis of research results and on-going evaluations will be used to develop a draft performance-based specification for retroreflective sheeting used in the manufacture of traffic control signs, and will serve as the basis for evaluating the potential impact of providing traffic control signs with varying levels of luminance on driver performance.  The work will be documented in a manner to permit the FHWA to determine if additional research is required to fully develop a performance-based specification, and if there is a need to revise the minimum maintained levels of retroreflectivity of traffic control signs due to either new knowledge of driver performance, headlamp specifications, and/or changes in measurement protocols used to characterize material performance.  Parties who feel they possess the capabilities to successfully perform the work referenced in this announcement should submit a letter of interest to the FHWA, along with their relevant experience, qualifications and capabilities to the following address: Federal Highway Administration, Office of Acquisition Management, 400 7th Street, S.W., Room 4410, Washington, D.C.  20590.

<DESC>1.  The Cryptologic Systems Group (CPSG), Special Projects Directorate at Lackland AFB, TX is soliciting your comments in response to several questions below.  This Request for Information (RFI) is not a formal solicitation and is not a request for proposals.  Any formal solicitation will be announced separately. This RFI is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. 2.  CPSG is developing a new generation of TT&C cryptographic devices to meet the needs of national security space programs and the Cryptographic Modernization (CM) program.  These new devices will be used to protect satellite and ground station command uplinks and telemetry downlinks from disruption or exploitation by non-authorized parties.   The Cryptologic Systems Group's Special Projects Directorate (CPSG/ZJ) is the developing program office assigned with the task of acquiring these cryptographic devices to support the modernization of Space TT&C for both satellite and ground control stations. 3.  CPSG intends to award a single contract to modify an existing Crypto-Modernized terrestrial re-programmable COMSEC product, with an option for production.  This modified COMSEC product will be used to replace existing/legacy Ground Operating Equipment (GOE) as well as a near term solution for new satellite ground stations.  The modified End Cryptographic Unit (ECU) will replace legacy GOE that implements the KG 28/46, KG-29/57, KI-23, CARDHOLDER, and BELSHAZZAR algorithms.  In order to meet the requirement of new ground stations the ECU will need to provide higher data rates and modern cryptographic features.  The final ECU will be NSA Type 1 certified. 4.  Attached you will find draft copies of the Statement of Objectives (SOO), Evaluation Factors for Award (RFP Section M), and Instructions, Conditions and Notices to Offerors (RFP Section L) for the aforementioned acquisition.  Please provide answers to the following questions. Your responses will be used in market research for this acquisition.

Additionally, prime contractors for this proposed effort are encouraged to include a photocopy, if any, of a current CMMI-SE/SW Version 1.1 or later (Staged) Maturity Level III or higher, by an SEI-authorized third party appraiser. 	Based on the language above: *	Is this language clear with respect to what is expected from the offeror? *	Would your company be able to provide the required documentation? *	Is the desirable "CMMI-SE/SW Version 1.1 or later (Staged) Maturity Level III or higher" achievable? *	Do the certifications above pose any difficulties for your company? d.

Based on the language above: *	Is this language clear with respect to what is expected from the offeror? *	Would your company be able to provide the required documentation? *	Does this pose any difficulties for your company? *	Could other documentation provide appropriate evidence? e.	Past Performance Questionnaire:  At paragraph 5.9 of Section L it states, "Performance shall be within the last three (3) years. The Government will not consider performance on an Offeror submission that occurred more than three (3) years prior to the date of this  solicitation." *	Is this period too restrictive?  If so, what length of period would your company recommend? f.	After reviewing Sections L and M, do you have any comments or suggestions? g.	Do you have any other comments or suggestions regarding this RFI? Please annotate the subject line of your email:  TT&C GOE I1 RFI #3 Response.  See Note 26.

<DESC>Solicitation Number N00421-06-T-0158 is hereby released as a request for quotes for “Brand Name Mandatory Lighting Protection Corporation commercial products.  Simplified procedures as described in FAR 13.5 will be utilized for acquisition of the required items.  The Government intends to award a Firm-Fixed Price Purchase Order for Commercial Items on a “Brand Name Mandatory” basis for the Lighting Protection Corporation  products listed below under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  This procurement is set-aside for Small Business.  The Special Communications Requirements (SCR) Division of the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) St. Inigoes, MD, has been tasked by the USAF RRSVS project to assemble and integrate Radio Unit (RU) / Interface Units (IU) equipment into transit cases.  The RRSVS Transit Case supplements equipment that is otherwise housed within rigid shelters on High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWV’s).  The RRSVS project is required to deliver advanced communications technology to the battlefield, while removing forward deployed troops from hostile locations.  Using RU/IU equipment replaces the soldiers with a machine, allowing people who would normally be stationed inside the immobile operations module to be redeployed from forward hostile environment.  The requested lighting and surge protectors provide RRSVS with the ability to dissipate the flow of electric current using relay switches and circuit breakers.  Additionally, the lighting and surge protectors control the power distribution through out the RRSVS, and are essential to the completion and integration of the equipment into transit cases that would remove deployed troops from hostile locations, thus preserving life.  In order to maintain compatibility and interoperability, the lighting and surge protectors must remain the same as those used in the currently fielded RRSVS.  Documentation and physical design have been previously established for RRSVS and a change to any subsystem would result in significant, unbudgeted costs to the Government.  The lightning and surge protectors were previously procured via contract N00421-06-P-0148.  Per the CCR, this supplier is a small business.  The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code for this requirement is 335931, “Current-Carrying Wiring Device Manufacturing” with a size standard of 500  employees.  The Government intends to award a Firm-Fixed Price Purchase Order to a Small Business on a “Brand Name Mandatory”  basis for the Lighting Protection Corporation products listed below under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  These products are compatible with existing program equipment and will satisfy the Government’s minimum requirement for intended application.  The “Brand Name Mandatory” Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) and Descriptions for this procurement are: ** CLIN 0001 - P/N:  LPC10755-163 Lighting & Surge Arrestor - (Qty - 13 Ea); CLIN 0002 – P/N:  LPC-23412-1 Lighting & Surge AC Power Arrestor - (Qty - 13 Ea);  CLIN 0003 - P/N:  LPC11845-170 Lighting & Surge Protector - (Qty - 646 Ea);  CLIN 0004 - P/N:  LPC11895-028 Surge Protector - (Qty - 187 Ea).  **  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES FOR ITEMS OTHER THAN THE BRAND NAME LIGHTING PROTECTION CORPORATION PRODUCTS LISTED IN THIS SYNOPSIS. **   The Government will accept quotes from all responsible Small Business  sources with the capability to provide the brand name products cited above and will award a Purchase Order resulting from this RFQ to the responsible vendor whose offer conforms to the solicitation and is considered to be most advantageous to the Government.  Quote is due to Rosa Harding, Contract Specialist, Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Building 8110, Unit 11, Villa Road, St. Ingioes, MD 20684-0010, by 3:30 P.M. EST, 15 May 2006. The Government reserves the right to process the procurement on a Brand Name Mandatory basis based upon the responses received. The Government will not pay for any information received.  Fascimile proposals shall be accepted.  For information regarding this solicitation, the primary point of contact is Rosa Harding, Contract Specialist, Code 251231, telephone number (301) 995-6037 or via e-mail at rosa.harding@navy.mil.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Child and Human Development (NICHD) intends to procure on a sole source basis with Michigan State University to provide analysis of data in order to identify risk factors of Preeclampsia (PE) and achieve early diagnosis and a potential effective treatment.  PE is an obstetric syndrome associated with a high maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Accumulating evidence suggests that an imbalance between pro-angiongenic and anti-angiogenic factors is involved in the pathophysiology of PE. Endoglin is a protein expressed on endothelial cells, which regulates the pro-angiogenic effects of transforming growth factor. There is limited information about the biology of endoglin during pregnancy and its associations with PE. the contractor will focus on statistical analysis for the associations between PE and risk factors such as maternal plasma concentrations of soluble endoglin, sVEGFR-1 and PlGF. The study subjects are patients with PE, HELLP syndrome and women who delivered small for gestational age (SGA) neonates. The contractor will apply various statistical models which are based on generalized linear model adjusted with clinical covariates such as maternal age, parity, previous preterm delivery, smoking and vaginal bleeding. With this approach, more powerful statistical tests on the identification of significant risk factors will be conducted and will greatly facilitate the understanding of the associations between PE and risk factors. By  Authority: 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or service will satisfy agency requirements.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ), Transportation and Climate Division (TCD) intends to award a sole source, firm-fixed-price purchase order to OnLocation, Inc. of Vienna, VA under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The purpose of this acquisition is to obtain analysis from a current, peer-reviewed analytical tool that can be utilized to assess alternative vehicle and fuel pathways of the U.S. light-duty vehicle fleet. Under this order,  OnLocation, Inc. will develop diagnostic runs that provide estimates of existing U.S. policies and sensitivities that reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the National Energy Modeling System (NEMS) Base Case through 2030 and deliver intermediate and final documentation of environmental and economical  results. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 541620. It has been determined that OnLocation, Inc. is uniquely qualified to satisfy the Government's requirement because it is the only firm that runs and has demonstrated ability to modify the NEMS's  transportation and associated energy models (e.g., the refinery and the fuels market models). This model is unique because many of the critical production and demand factors and relationships of the U.S. transportation sector and related fuels sectors have been developed, incorporated and refined  within the model.  NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE. However, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a written capabilities statement, which, if received by the response date of this announcement, will be considered.  Responses to this posting must be in writing. A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The estimated value of this procurement is below the simplified acquisition threshold as set forth in  FAR 2.101. All questions should be directed to Jami Rodgers via the e-mail link below.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Intelligent Automation, Inc., Rockville, MD, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) Soliciting From a Single Source, relative to research management services for extending NIST programs in the application and development of systems for topographic measurement of bullets and casings for ballistics identification. This is a sole source requirement as the vendor has crucial data (e.g., bullet materials and surface topography) accumulated from a previous effort.  The incumbent contractor has extensive expertise in both the ballistics characterization and 3D surface topography measuring to permit re-analyzing of collected data by refined methods.  A fixed price purchase order will be issued on or about May 26, 2006 with a 12-mo. performance period.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement, in writing, no later than the response date.  Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona fide capability to fulfill the requirement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  This notice of intent is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ) nor is it a request for competition.  See Note 26

<DESC>Requirement:

The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Washington, DC that will be expiring April 30, 2007.  The Government is seeking to lease approximately 56,000 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space, including 13 parking spaces.  The rentable space must yield a minimum of 47,117 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet.  The lease term requirement is for 5 years firm.  The space must be available for occupancy by March 1, 2007.  The delineated area is:

North: H Street
South: Constitution Avenue
East: 14th Street
West: 18th Street

The Government is considering whether to remain in its existing lease space or relocate to alternative space.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternative space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move cost, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, non-productive agency downtime, etc.

Expressions of Interest must be submitted to the above address by 5:00 PM on May 18, 2006, and must include the following information:
-	Building name and address.
-	Rentable square feet available and expected rental rate per rentable square foot, fully serviced.
-	ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF) to be offered and expected rental rate per OASF, fully serviced.
-	Date of space availability.
-	Method of rentable space measurement.
-	Building Ownership Information.
-	Amount of parking available on-site and its cost - include whether expected rental rate includes the cost of the required Government parking (if any).
-	List of building services provided.

The Government's decision regarding whether or not to relocate will be based, in part, on information received in response to this advertisement.  In the event that a potential Offeror fails to provide specific rental rate or other required information as part of its response to this advertisement, the government reserves the right to assume that the building in question cannot meet the Government's requirements.  With specific respect to expected rental rate information, the Government will assume the maximum rental rate authorized in the applicable lease prospectus related to this requirement in the event the respondent fails to include such information.

DATES:  It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 06 should be submitted by 31 May 2006; FY 07 by 15 Oct 2006; FY 08 by 1 May 2007; and FY 09 by 1 May 2008.  White papers will be accepted until 2:00 p.m. Eastern time on 31 Oct 2009, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.    

I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

This BAA seeks research efforts that advance the state-of-the-art in the area of information discovery and delivery, advanced, multi-constraint and distributed optimization techniques and evaluation models to support mobility operations across a broad set of missions.

The Air Force's Air Mobility Command (AMC) provides global air support for the entire Department of Defense. This includes air support for the President, day-to-day operational support, natural disaster support, humanitarian support, aerial refueling, and warfighter support during operations in hostile environments. Current operations include the planning and execution of over seven hundred (700) sorties per day.  They are hampered by limited support to aircrews, who receive an inadequate near-real time view of the mission and less-than-current information on changes in weather and airport capabilities. Limited connectivity to the aircraft, characterized by only basic voice communications and limited data transmissions, creates problems for the dynamic decision making required in a changing environment. This BAA addresses the need to provide enhancements in information discovery and delivery, advanced, multi-constraint and distributed optimization techniques, timely situation awareness of AMC global activities, enhanced decision aiding and course of action analysis through automation and evaluation models to support mobility operations with special emphasis on increased efficiency and decreased routine workload across functional and supervisory positions.  The requirement is for open-architected, scalable, and government-owned solutions to these issues and is soliciting white papers for innovative technologies to support command and control applications that can significantly reduce the time between information technology availability and its employment into the research and development programs that will support and improve legacy and new military electronic systems operations. Also of interest are commercial technologies that can improve the functionality, performance, reliability, longevity, and usability of these new and legacy military electronic systems.

The overall objective of this BAA is to develop, integrate and demonstrate system technologies.  The developed capabilities may be transitioned to AMC programs, for example Global Decision Support System (GDSS) 2, and US Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) programs.


II. AWARD INFORMATION:

Total funding for this BAA is approximately $24.5M.  The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 06 - $40K; FY 07 - $8.95M; FY 08 - $8.25M; and FY09 - $7.26M.  Individual awards will not normally exceed 36 months with dollar amounts ranging from $40,000 to $1,200,000 per year.  Awards of efforts as a result of this announcement will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed.

III. ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION:

1.  ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS:  All potential applicants are eligible.  Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures.

For additional information, a copy of the AFRL/Rome Research Sites "Broad Agency Announcement (BAA): A Guide for Industry," Aug 2005, may be accessed at: http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/div/IFK/bp-guide.doc.

2.  CONTENT AND FORM OF SUBMISSION:   Offerors are required to submit 3 copies of a 3 to 5 page white paper summarizing their proposed approach/solution. The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. The white paper will be formatted as follows: Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Estimated Cost of Task, Name/Address of Company, Technical and Contracting Points of Contact (phone, fax and email)(this section is NOT included in the page count); Section B: Task Objective; and Section C: Technical Summary and Proposed Deliverables. Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror. If the offeror wishes to restrict its white papers/proposals, they must be marked with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a) and (b). All white papers/proposals shall be double spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch.  In addition, respondents are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number, a fax number, and an e-mail address with their submission. All responses to this announcement must be addressed to the technical POC, as discussed in paragraph five of this section.  

3.  SUBMISSION DATES AND TIMES:  It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 06 should be submitted by 31 May 2006; FY 07 by 15 Oct 2006; FY 08 by 1 May 2007; and FY 09 by 1 May 2008.  White papers will be accepted until 2:00 p.m. Eastern time on 31 Oct 2009, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  

4.  FUNDING RESTRICTIONS:  The cost of preparing white papers/proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.   Incurring pre-award costs for ASSISTANCE INSTRUMENTS ONLY, are regulated by the DoD Grant and Agreements Regulations (DODGARS). 

5.  OTHER SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:  DO NOT send white papers to the Contracting Officer.  All responses to this announcement must be addressed to ATTN: Liz Kean, Air Force Research Laboratory, 525 Brooks Rd, Rome NY, 13441-4505.

V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:

1.  CRITERIA:  The following criteria, which are listed in equal order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- Including the innovation of the proposed technology, the technical approach, and the operational relevance of the problem solution to address current and future Air Force net-centric requirements, (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates intellect, technical expertise, and domain knowledge, (3) Openness of Solution - The extent to which open architecture standards and technologies are leveraged, and (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).  Also, consideration will be given to past and present performance on recent Government contracts, and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this BAA. No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.   

VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission. 

2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:  Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a secret facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to secret information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.

3.  REPORTING:   Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS.  Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.  

VII.  AGENCY CONTACTS:

Questions of a technical nature shall be directed to the cognizant technical point of contact, as specified below:

    Elizabeth Kean
    Telephone:  (315) 330-2601 
    Email:  Elizabeth.Kean@rl.af.mil

In accordance with AFFARS 5315.90, an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition announcement.  Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This requirement is sole source to Boeing Company, 499 Boeing Blvd., Huntsville, AL 35824. Boeing Company is the Avenger system prime contractor. FUs were competitively procured as a non-developmental item (NDI) in 1986. Boeing Company designed, deve loped, and is the current manufacturer of the FUs. It is not feasible to procure this requirement from another source since the Government does not own a performance specification or Technical Data Package (TDP) suitable for competition. To award a competi tive contract to another source, the Government would incur cost of $60M to procure data rights from Boeing for use of the TDP, $10M for facilitization, and $2.5M for first article testing. Moreover, the source selection process and testing would add 2 yea rs to the delivery schedule. Therefore, Boeing is the only source that can meet required schedule for Egypt. With respect to quantities, Boeing is the only qualified source with the necessary skills and knowledge, data rights, special test equipment, and f acilities required to produce these items. Contract Jacqueline Cole, contract Specialist, (256) 842-7686, Betty L. Smith, Contracting Officer, (256) 876-3939. The closing date is 31 May 2006, 02:00 PM CST. See Note 22.

<DESC>The United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) intends to award a contract on a sole-source basis to DataAspects Corporation, pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, for the design and development of software applications for the maintenance , storage, and retrieval of chemical and biological information from a complex, multi-tiered system invented (Patent No. 6,654,736) and operated by the Department of Chemical Information at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research.  The system is large a nd sophisticated, containing integrated information on over 500,000 chemical compounds and their testing results in numerous in-vitro and in-vivo biological assays.  Many skills are required of those engaged in the creation and maintenance of this system i ncluding chemistry, parasitology, biological testing, chemical inventory management and information technology.  Two to three years are required to attain a proficiency in these areas sufficient to contribute independently to the systems growth.  DataAspe cts was instrumental in the conversion of this very system from index-sequential to relational- and thesaurus-oriented databases and one of the employees at DataAspects served as the principal investigator for five years of the systems development from 19 90 through 1994.   USAMRAA intends to award this requirement under Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  A firm-fixed-price-type award is planned.  Interested respondents who feel that they are capable of meeting these requirements may identify their interes t by submitting technical documentation and resumes demonstrating capability to Dana Herndon at FAX No. 301-619-3002 by 19 May 2006.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  No telephone requests will be accepted.

<CONTACT>Jillian Pate, Contract Specialist, Phone (703) 292-8252, Fax (703) 292-9140, Email jpate@nsf.gov
<DESC>To Whom It May Concern:

The National Science Foundation (NSF), an independent agency of the United States Government, is seeking information regarding the long-term (10 or more years) availability of icebreaking services capable of enabling the re-supply of the U.S. Antarctic Program’s (USAP) McMurdo Station.  NSF is the U.S. Government Agency responsible for directing and funding the USAP, and manages the entire United States national program in Antarctica, including logistic support activities, so that the program may be managed as a single package.

Background

NSF is interested in contracting for icebreaking services to annually open a channel through 1-2 year 10/10ths sea ice, and then escort an ice-strengthened tanker and an ice-strengthened cargo ship to the pier at McMurdo Station, located at 77°51’ S, 166°40’ E.   NSF intends for this to be a long-term arrangement.   It is expected that a contract would include annual mobilization and de-mobilization periods (length of time to be determined based on location of home port) and an operating period in the Southern Ocean south of 60° S of approximately 6 to 8 weeks.  After that period the vessel would be off-contract and free to engage in other work.

Traditionally, the USAP has relied on the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) to perform the McMurdo break-in and ship escort service using its POLAR class ships.  However, these vessels are 30 years old and are reaching the end of their design life.  NSF is now seeking alternative means of opening the supply channel to McMurdo Station through a reliable long-term arrangement, either with a commercial or governmental provider, or through a multi-national arrangement.     
 
NSF is not seeking binding offers to contract at this time; however, based upon the information received the Foundation may initiate discussions, seek offers, and award a contract with an owner or operator per the authority at 42 U.S.C. 1870(c).


The United States Antarctic Program

Scientific research, and operational support of that research, is the principal activity supported by the United States Government in Antarctica.  The goals are to expand fundamental knowledge of the region, to foster research on global and regional problems of current scientific importance, and to utilize the region as a platform from which to support research.  For projects involving fieldwork, the USAP supports research that can only or can best be done in Antarctica. 

The Program has been in continuous operation since the 1957-1958 International Geophysical Year and continuation into the foreseeable future is anticipated.  U.S. activities in Antarctica support the Nation's adherence to the Antarctic Treaty, which reserves the region for peaceful purposes and encourages international cooperation in scientific research.  At present, 45 nations adhere to the treaty, and 29 of them are involved in Antarctic field activities.  The United States cooperates scientifically and operationally with many of the Antarctic Treaty nations.

The major logistics hub for the support of this science is McMurdo Station.  McMurdo is located on Ross Island in the Southern edge of the Ross Sea.  It is the furthest south exposed land to which a ship can sail.  Refer to http://nsf.gov/od/opp/prss/ for a more complete description of the USAP research support facilities including McMurdo Station.


Typical Schedule and Operations

The icebreaker typically arrives at 60° S on or about December 25.  Anticipated departure from McMurdo is mid-February of the following year (6-8 weeks after arrival).   The basic tasks are to open a channel to the McMurdo Station pier, and escort a tanker and a freighter through the sea ice and channel to the pier and back to the open ocean as required

The freighter to be used during the 2005/2006 season will be the AMERICAN TERN (17,350 tons, 158.8m/23.16m).    The tanker to be used will be one of five sister ships of the T-5 class (33,093 tons, 187.5m/27.4m).   Use of supply ships of similar capacity and size are anticipated over the life of the contract.  Additional information on these vessels may be found at:

http://www.msc.navy.mil/inventory/ships.asp?ship=paulbuck&type=GovernmentownedTanker.

The U.S. Navy, Military Sealift Command provides these vessels for the USAP.  The tanker arrives at the McMurdo ice edge on or about January 16 each year, and departs on or about January 20 each year.  The freighter arrives at the McMurdo ice edge on or about February 1 each year, and departs on or about February 11 each year.

Sea Ice

The fast ice in McMurdo Sound has typically been between 7 to 10 feet maximum thickness for a distance of 10 to 20 miles from McMurdo.  It is often first or second year ice and had rarely been third year ice until very recently.  Appendix I provides a listing of the extent of sea ice and the vessels used since 1957.   For the past four years there have been extraordinary ice conditions due at least in part to the presence of large icebergs that were partially blocking McMurdo Sound.  For those past four years there has been extensive first year ice with some inclusions of second year ice extending from McMurdo to about 100 miles north.  Ice thicknesses were as great as 12 feet.  Ice in the channel has blown out to open water once in that four-year period, but the surrounding ice extending approximately 14 miles north from McMurdo is multi-year ice.  The two largest of the icebergs have moved out of the area since last year and it is expected that the coming season’s ice should start to return to a more normal status in the short term, but clearly conditions can change rapidly and persist for extended periods.

A chart showing sea ice thickness measurements for 1987 to 2004 is included as Attachment 2.  Recent archival images may be viewed at: http://rapidfire.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/subsets/?RossSea/, and http://www.polar.org/sat_image/

Evaluation Information

Interested parties are free to provide any information that they believe may assist NSF in its evaluation of the availability and reliability of icebreaking services; however, the Foundation will not pay for any information submitted.  Except as identified herein, no specific format is required.  

Among the evaluation factors that NSF would consider in determining suitability of an existing or to-be-built vessel for icebreaking services would be:

·	Vessel’s ice classification and maximum ice thickness and speed of advance for continuous progress
·	Vessel’s displacement
·	Statement of availability
·	Ship’s registry
·	Vessel’s or vessels’ name and specifications using BIMCO Supplytime 89, Annex A as the format
·	Name/address of vessel’s owner and vessel’s operator (if different)
·	Certificate of current classification
·	Time remaining prior to any major maintenance activity and dry docking
·	Approximate price per day, and any extras (e.g., taxes, victuals, commissions, communications)
·	Expected mobilization and demobilization charges and port of initiation/return
·	Past performance contact information
·	Special operating restrictions or conditions

It is highly desirable that the vessel have sufficient fuel storage to complete the entire Antarctic operation without any re-fueling from McMurdo.  Please specifically indicate whether the intended vessel has the fuel storage capacity to enable this.  

If the vessel must receive fuel during the period of time while operating in the Southern Ocean, McMurdo can provide an all purpose diesel fuel, JP-5.  Specifications for this fuel are set forth on Page 4 of the publication titled Fuel Users Guide, 2000.  It can be found at http://usapc.army.mil/miscellaneous/2000%20fuel%20users%20guide%20(sep%202000).pdf.  Respondents are asked to review this fuel specification and comment on its suitability.  If another diesel fuel must be used (e.g. MGO or MDO), NSF can have it delivered by the tanker coming to McMurdo.  Please provide an estimate of the quantity of fuel that must be delivered (fuel consumed during mobilization and during ice breaking operations up to the time of the scheduled tanker arrival).  There is no tankage for storage of specialty fuels in McMurdo, thus the fuel must be delivered directly from the tanker.  The tanker cannot deliver heavy fuels.  

Where fuel is expected to be provided at McMurdo, appropriate adjustments shall be made to the approximate price per day.

In the event of a need for heavy fuel, if necessary, the icebreaker could go to New Zealand to refuel – this will take time away from icebreaking duties and is not desirable.  Respondents are asked to indicate if this mode of refueling will be required. 

The Committee of Managers of National Antarctic Programs (COMNAP) is currently developing ballast water management plans for the Antarctic.  A draft management plan is attached.  Please comment on your ability to comply with this plan.


Thank you in advance for your interest in the acquisition programs of the National Science Foundation.  Though NSF will consider any information interested parties choose to submit at any time, the privilege of your submission on or prior to February 28, 2006 is requested.  Inquiries of a technical nature may be addressed to Mr. Michael Van Woert, Executive Officer, Office of Polar Programs, at the letterhead address, Room 755; by telephone to +1 (703) 292-8030; or by e-mail to mvanwoer@nsf.gov.  Submissions and other inquiries may be addressed to the undersigned at the letterhead address, Division of Contracts and Complex Agreements, Room 475; by telephone to +1 (703) 292-8252; or by e-mail to jpate@nsf.gov .

<SUBJECT>70--Request for Information - Activity Based Costing (ABC) program.
<SOLNBR>M00264
<RESPDATE>051906
<ARCHDATE>06182006
<CONTACT>Carol Neely, Contract Specialist E-mail: carol.neely@usmc.mil
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide the following: 1.  Question:  I was wondering if the potential requirement for "End to End Analysis of the Activity Based Consulting (ABC) Program" is new? If not, could you please provide me with the incumbents name, contract #, contract type, date of award, period of performance and monetary value?  Answer:   The requirement for ABC is not new, however it is under review for re-engineering.  The current incumbent was not contracted to do an analysis of our current program, but rather to sustain our current capability.  The incumbent is Executive Information Systems (EIS).  Contract# M00264-05-F-0344.  Type:  Firm Fixed Price.  Date of award: 30 Sep 2005.  Period of performance and monetary value:  1 Oct 05 – 30 Sep 07, $920,238.00.  2.  Question:   Is there a technical point of contact for this procurement? Answer:  This is not a procurement but a request for information only.  This information will not be provided at this time. 3.  Question: Can you please elaborate on what systems and required functionality you view as part of an "end to end" system? Answer:  The Marine Corps implemented Activity-Based Costing/Management (ABCM) across the Corps in the late 1990s, and in 2003 the decision was made to incorporate an enterprise-wide implementation of Activity Based Resource Management (ABRM) critical enablers and supporting functions that cross all USMC intermediate commands, USMC bases, depots, logistics bases, air stations, and facilities.  The Activity Based Information System (ABIS) is a set of manual and automated processes to build, collect, aggregate, store, and classify cost (financial) and operational (task and activity) data to produce ABC models and information as part of the Marine Corps ABCM Program.  The ABIS program supports ABC models and ABRM by providing the Marine Corps with a total cost and performance management capability that, at minimum, provides full cost information using standard processes, standard outputs, and performance measures.  Systems include Enterprise Shared Data Environment (ESDE), Exte!  nsible Business Intelligence Tool (xBIT), USMC built and maintained interface to data warehouse.  Legacy systems include; MCTFS/ODSE – military manpower, SABRS/SMARTS – USMC financial resources, AXIS-one – MCCS financials, Peoplesoft – MCCS human resources.  Functionality of an “end to end” system would include extraction of specific data from legacy systems, through ABC software, and finally the production of an online data/information cube. 4.  Question:   What are the current planning activities, deployment schedules and data collection capabilities of the existing USMC legacy system? Answer:  Planning activities include capturing standard USMC Headquarters program management products and services, unit costs, and performance measures.  There is currently no deployment schedules or data collection capability.  Our previous implementation plan was developed for enterprise-wide use of ABC/M data via scheduled phase plans:  Discovery, Conversion, and Normalization.  Each implementation phase was expected to be about 22 weeks in duration.  Discovery (now complete) introduced base personnel to ABC/M theory and techniques, and provided an initial ABC capability at each installation (i.e. simple modeling and initial performance data).  During Conversion the models matured, standard processes and performance measures were implemented across the bases, and ABC/M began to influence the Program Objective Memorandum (POM) cycle and business planning.  During normalization, MCBEO took lessons learned from individual bases, automating the interfaces from the source sys!  tems, and further standardizing the data to enable benchmarking and comparative performance management and analysis.  Our final desire is to have the capability to accurately, efficiently, and responsively collect, publish and analyze total product and service costs and performance data. 5.  Question:  What are the existing USMC legacy ABC system(s) and the legacy systems with which an ABC system must be interoperable? Answer:  See item/question 3.   6.  Question:  Do you maintain separate ABC models for each functional area (if so, how many?) or are the functional areas incorporated into a single base/station enterprise model? Answer:  We do not maintain ABC models by functional area but rather by single USMC base and station.  Data from the cost models are then consolidated into a USMC-wide Cognos data cube.  7.  Question:  What are the reengineering objectives of the ABCM program? Answer:  The objective is to streamline the current ABC process that is currently very cumbersome, complex, timely, expensive and potentially inefficient to collect and maintain cost and performance data across the USMC enterprise.  Another objective is to include additional operational systems data into the ABC/M process and automate the refreshing of data to the extent possible and to capture additional USMC components beyond the base and station level of the organization.  This allows the Marine Corps to fulfill the elements of the following financial management legislative and regulatory requirements.  The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 requires agencies to submit to OMB a strategic plan for program activities that include performance goals and objectives, and the ABIS program can provide performance and cost information for Marine Corps activities.  The Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996 requires that agency financial systems comply wit!  h Federal Financial Management Requirements, Federal Accounting Standards, and align with the US Standard General Ledger at the transaction level. The Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Standards Number 4, “Managerial Cost Accounting Concepts and Standards for the Federal Government” is one of the accounting standards for which ABIS (and the ABC models) fulfills the requirements of: “(1) accumulating and reporting costs of activities on a regular basis for management information purposes; (2) establishing responsibility segments to match costs with outputs; (3) determining full costs of government goods and services; (4) recognizing the costs of goods and services provided among federal entities; and (5) using appropriate costing methodologies to accumulate and assign costs to outputs.” 8.  Question:  What is the envisioned target completion date for transitioning to the new streamlined ABC system? Answer:  Realistically, the completion date will be on-going for some time as this is seen as an evolutionary process, however, initial operating capability (IOC) would be 12 months after deployment. 9.  Question:  Do you have a preference to where ABC models are updated and maintained – by personnel at base/station level or by personnel located at one of your intermediate commands? Answer:  Our preference is to remove the “grunt” work from the base and stations Business Performance Offices (BPOs) while keeping the information useful to the base/station commanders, Headquarters program managers and automating the process to the extent possible.  This does not necessarily mean individual base/station models, but where feasible and for accuracy and efficiency purposes, perhaps a “regional” concept may be more practical.  Another option might be to populate and maintain an enterprise-wide model at the Headquarters that is populated with rolled up base/station data. 10.  Question:  The title of the RFI implies that the government desires information ‘to conduct a survey and end-to-end analysis of the Activity Based Costing (ABC) program.” The description of the RFI does not explicitly request a survey or end-to-end analysis to be conducted.  Please clarify, does the government desire a contractor to conduct a survey and end-to-end analysis of the ABC program or is the government already conducting their own survey and analysis?   Answer:  The government does not desire a contractor to conduct a survey or end-to-end process review and/or analysis.  The survey is the Government’s desire to acquire information regarding how the USMC may better build, maintain, support and provide total cost and performance data/information for better decision making.  The end-to-end analysis is what we are looking for from potential contractors regarding how they would implement, deploy and otherwise execute ABRM in an organization of our size and culture. 11.  Question:   How is the Marine Corps Business Enterprise Office (MCBEO) defining a Community of Practice?   Answer:  Our Community of Practice (COP) is the Business Performance Offices located at each of the 16 bases/stations, 3 intermediate commands and two regional commands who are responsible for continuous process improvement and program implementation.   12.  Question:  Does the Community of Practice (CoP) currently exist within the MCBEO?   Answer:   Yes. 13.  Question:  What software is the MCBEO currently using to support their ABC effort?  Answer:  SAS Oros Analytics v5.5. 14.  Question: What are the current MCBEO planning activities and deployment schedules that the COTS software should support?  Answer:  See item/question 4 and 8. 15.  Question:   Clarify the current scope of the MCBEO ABC implementation process that the government desires to streamline. What are the start and end points of the process?  Answer:  See item/question 7.  The current start point is the population and construction of local ABC models, the end point is with the publication of the enterprise-wide cost data/information contained in an online data cube.

<SUBJECT>A -- Clinical Trial Methods in Neurology
<SOLNBR>NIH-NINDS-06-03
<RESPDATE>071806
<ARCHDATE>08022006
<CONTACT>Laurie Leonard, Contracting Officer, Phone 301 496-1813, Fax 301 402-4225, Email ll44s@nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is considering issuing a contract to develop a course of intensive training in clinical trial methodology for neurology research.   NINDS is attempting to identify sources with experience and expertise to develop and coordinate the scientific design and implementation of such training.  

The field of neurology clinical trials is still fairly young; unlike in oncology and other disciplines, there is no highly developed standard for clinical trial methodology, especially with respect to pilot or early phase trials. Good design and conduct of clinical trials can provide the necessary knowledge for the generation of definitive answers about the effectiveness of new therapeutic approaches.  In contrast, poorly designed or administered trials may provide misleading results, subject patients to unnecessary risk, waste considerable resources, and potentially diminish the interest of the research community and the public in the clinical trials enterprise.   The need for more medically-trained researchers with appropriate methodological training has been identified as an important limiting factor in the scope and quality of clinical research overall and specifically in neurology.

The purpose of the “Clinical Trial Methods in Neurology” course is to increase the reliability and effectiveness of clinical trials by: introducing clinical fellows and junior faculty in any neurology or neurosurgical subspecialty to the principles of good clinical trial design; exposing early career clinical scientists to the full spectrum of challenges in clinical research; and developing a cadre of well-trained, experienced clinical researchers whose expertise will foster better clinical trials design and thereby hasten the introduction of improved regimens for therapy and prevention of neurological disorders into everyday medical practice and patient care.

It is anticipated that this annual course will yield a group of talented, dedicated neurology researchers who will consequently be in a position to obtain funding for their own high quality clinical research.  If the program is successful, it is anticipated that students will return to their academic departments where they will take a prominent role in advancing local research priorities in neurology.  To achieve this objective, NINDS requires a high-impact program for training future researchers that is innovative and that exceeds all other training experiences available to those treating neurological disease.  Currently, more than half of the NINDS extramural clinical trials budget is spent on early phase (phase I, II and pilot) trials.  However, the majority of trials supported through the NINDS pilot study program have not made use of the full range of available trial designs and thus have not been as effective as possible in leading to high-impact definitive clinical trials.  Thus, the primary focus of this solicitation will be on developing researchers with expertise in early phase clinical trials.

<DESC>This request for information/sources sought announcement is issued to identify potential sources and gather information on current capabilities within the market.  The Air Force Metrology and Calibration Program is considering a  sole source award to Flow Systems, Inc. for the purchase of gas flow transfer standard (GFTS) that is a portable gas flow standard with four critical flow venturis (CFV), and onboard pressure, temperature and humidity sensors.  There are two of these units within the Air Force which were designed and built by Flow Systems, Inc.  The data from the sensors is processed as gas flows through the CFVs and is fed through algorithms, partly based on the CFV calibration coefficients, and the gas flow rate is output to the user.  The upgrade is to redo the software in part to allow for proficiency testing and adjustment of CFV calibration coefficients, to add a bypass around the manual pressure regulator for ease of use when being used in a downstream position against the sonic gas flow calibrator (SGFC), and to have the laptop operating system upgraded from Windows 98 to Windows XP.  Proficiency testing software addition is to enable the GFTS to be used by a field-level Air Force Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratory (PMEL) without knowing the GFTS outputs.  This option would be password protected so that the Proficiency testing can be performed without potential adjustment of output values.  The test results file would be in a password protected Microsoft Excel format.  A current version of commercial software should be the starting point for the software requirements.  Raw test data should be output in a Microsoft Excel file; this test data should be user-selectable during testing setup.  GFTS can be sent to contractor for up-front analysis. 

The estimated quantity is two units.  Surplus or used material is not acceptable for this item.  Offerors responding to this sources sought market research must (1) state whether they are a small or large business and indicate if your company is a small disadvantage or woman-owned business, 8(a) firm, or a historically black college or university or minority institution (HBCU/MI), or a historically underutilized business zone (HUBZone) small business; (2) advise what the longest period of time is that you can hold the quoted price; (3) advise if you have the item on a GSA schedule or other Government contract; (4) provide information concerning the technical capabilities of the product you are interested in offering, including commercial literature/brochures; (5) advise if you accept the Government purchase card; (6) any other pertinent information which would enable the government to assess your firm’s capabilities; (7) provide point of contact and assigned Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; (9) advise how much time you would need to submit a technical proposal once the solicitation is issued; (10) provide an estimated price for one each of the unit you would be offering.   Please note that this synopsis is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for competitive quotes/proposals and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. However, all interested parties who believe they can meet the requirements are invited to submit in writing complete information describing their ability to provide the item listed above.  The information received as a result of this synopsis will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Air Force not to open the requirement to open competition, based on response to this sources sought synopsis, is solely within the discretion of the Air Force.  The Government will not pay for information solicited hereunder. At this time, no solicitation exists. Submit all responses to this notice to the point of contact listed below. All responses should be submitted to Glenna Pound, Contracting Officer, via e-mail at Glenna.Pound@afmetcal.af.mil or by Fax at 740-788-5157 or mail to 813 Irving-Wick Dr W, Bldg 2, Heath Oh 43056-1199, if e-mail response is not possible. Use reference number 07M-202A-FL in your response. Responses are due by 15 May 06.

NOTIFICATION OF PLANNED SOLICITATION

ENGINEERING PLANT OPERATORS CONTINUUM (EPOC)

On 2 March 2006, NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division posted a Sources/Sought Market Survey stipulating the need for the following requirement: “to support the Center for Naval Engineering (CNE) acquiring the development of asynchronous self-paced training materials for use in the Navy - Integrated Learning Environment (ILE). In the execution of their broad and diverse mission, CNE has a requirement to provide a revised/enhanced, scenario-based curriculum in a self-paced interactive delivery format for the Journeyman skill level engineer(s) referred to as Engineering Plant Operators Course (EPOC). The current training is delivered via approximately 119 instructor-lead C, D, F, and G schools. The EPOC product to be purchased under this contract is to enhance cognitive skill development through a blended solution of re-engineered delivery techniques for Surface Engineering personnel assigned to the fleet.  EPOC is to address the operator and maintenance skill objects required by the Surface Engineers of the Navy’s non-nuclear shipboard propulsion and auxiliary systems. This effort seeks to enhance the course through reduction of the instructor-led, classroom-based portion by delivering initial instruction and refresher training via self-paced Interactive Multimedia Instruction (IMI). As a result, this effort will require that all forms of instructional strategies, assessment strategies, delivery methods and media be considered in order to provide learning activities and events that will support learning behaviors at the highest level of cognition, including application, synthesis, and evaluation.”

The purpose for this announcement is to notify industry of the disposition for the EPOC Project, since the posting of the Sources Sought/Market Survey dated 2 March 2006.  The Government extends its appreciation to all the organizations that took time to response to the EPOC DRAFT Statement of Work (SOW).  As a result of your feedback, the EPOC Government Team has refined the DRAFT SOW to more clearly define the requirements.

<DESC>POTENTIAL ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITY FOR SDVOSB - CONSTRUCTION PROJECT FOR BURIAL AREA EXPANSION AT THE ROCK ISLAND NATIONAL CEMTERY. This modification changes language in the original notice that stated Beaufort National Cemetery to correct to Rock Island National Cemetery.  This is the only change. Please e-mail your response to this message to Candace Wood, no later than 2:00 p.m., EST, Monday, May 15, 2006, at the following address: Candace.Wood@va.gov  In an effort to enhance opportunities for SDVOSBs and increase the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) accomplishments in this important socioeconomic category, VA's National Cemetery Administration is performing preliminary market research to gauge the level of interest and capabilities of SDVOSBs with regards to an upcoming acquisition for Construction Services at the Rock Island National Cemetery, IL.  The findings of the preliminary market research will be used in considering a 100% set aside for SDVOSBs, pursuant to the set-aside authority contained in Public Law 108-183, the Veterans Benefits Act of 2003, as implemented in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 19.14. NAICS code for this acquisition is 237990.  The Size Standard is $28.5 Million.  The magnitude of this project is between $10,000,000 and $20,000,000.  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT:  Contractor shall provide construction services for development of new burial areas on 23 acres acquired from the Rock Island Army Arsenal, to include full-casket gravesites in pre-placed crypts, development of columbaria niches, Millennium Study repairs, and supporting infrastructure such as road and utilities. Quantities will be sufficient to support a ten-year projection of burial needs. Renovations and expansion of the administration and maintenance facility of a new public restroom, a new committal shelter, road repairs, drainage corrections, and water distribution system will be provided. New boundary fencing will be installed in coordination with existing boundary walls.  Performance period is approximately 550 calendar days from date of receipt of Notice to Proceed.  Bid, Payment, and Performance bonds will be required. REQUIRED RESPONSES:  Your review of this information and response to the following questions will be used to determine if this acquisition may be set-aside exclusively for competition among SDVOSBs.  Please review the specifications and technical requirements carefully before responding to this e-mail.   (1)  Has your firm, as a prime contractor, whether individually or through a formal joint venture or teaming agreement, or under subcontract to a prime contractor, provided construction services for projects of similar size and scope (Government or commercial) within the last five years as described in the brief description of project above?  If yes, please provide the following information on your three most recent projects of a similar size and scope to this project: (a) Contracting Agency Address & contracting officer's name and telephone number. 	(b) Contract Number, date and amount of award, date of completion 	(c) Description of Items/Services provided under the contract. 	(d) If any bonding was provided, what was the amount of bonding?   	(e) If performance was as a subcontractor, please provide the name, address and telephone number of the point of contact at the prime contractor. 	(f) State whether or not there were any performance issues under the contract which resulted in the issuance of a Cure Notice or Show Cause Notice by the contracting officer. (2)  In order to determine if an acquisition can be set-aside for SDVOSBs, the contracting officer must determine that there are a sufficient number of SDVOSBs capable of performing the contract requirement and that award can be made at a reasonable, fair market price.  To that end, please provide your firm's individual and aggregate contract bonding capacity. (3)  Has your firm ever been terminated for cause or default from a contractual arrangement, whether Federal or private sector, as a result of failure to perform, poor quality and workmanship provided, etc.?  If so, please provide the specifics. (4)  Has your firm, or any firm that you would potentially joint venture or team with for a large acquisition of construction services or for any acquisition, ever bid on a Federal acquisition and been determined non-responsible by the contracting officer and the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) failed to issue a Certificate of Competency (COC) to your firm or teaming partners when the matter was referred to SBA for review and consideration? Please e-mail your responses and any relevant information regarding specific performance or other qualifications regarding the construction services requested, no later than May 15, 2006 to Candace Wood at Candace.Wood@va.gov  Do not send hard copy advertising or promotional materials.  Please ensure that all responses are comprehensive and provide a name and point-of-contact for your firm for follow-up by this office or the procuring contracting officer. If you have responded to any previous e-mail messages or had other communications with our office regarding preliminary market research for this construction project, please be advised that it will be necessary for you to respond to this e-mail and the questions contained therein.  Although responses are not required, the information will be helpful in assisting this office, as SDVOSB advocates, in trying to influence the acquisition strategy for the construction project in Illinois by ensuring maximum practicable opportunities for SDVOSBs. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS SUCH.  All information is to be provided on a voluntary basis at no charge to the Government.  There is no entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs related to or arising out of responding to this request for information.  All information provided becomes property of the Government.  There is no guarantee, expressed or implicit, that the market research for this acquisition will result in a SDVOSB set-aside or SDVOSB sole source award, or any other guarantee of award or acquisition strategy.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to readdress a question regarding this synopsis.  The following is provided:  Question:  What does electronic services reference (types of services, projects, personnel) and in what nature should a contractor approach  this in the submittal?  Response:  The following classifications published by the Department of Labor generally describe the duties performed by each engineer.  Electrical engineers design, develop, test, and supervise the manufacture of electrical equipm ent. Some of this equipment includes electric motors; machinery controls, lighting, and wiring in buildings; automobiles; aircraft; radar and navigation systems; and power-generating, -controlling, and transmission devices used by electric utilities. Altho ugh the terms electrical and electronics engineering often are used interchangeably in academia and industry, electrical engineers have traditionally focused on the generation and supply of power, whereas electronics engineers have worked on applications o f electricity to control systems or signal processing. Electrical engineers specialize in areas such as power systems engineering or electrical equipment manufacturing.  Electronics engineers, except computer, are responsible for a wide range of technologi es, from portable music players to the global positioning system (GPS), which can continuously provide the location of a vehicle. Electronics engineers design, develop, test, and supervise the manufacture of electronic equipment such as broadcast and commu nications systems. Many electronics engineers also work in areas closely related to computers. However, engineers whose work is related exclusively to computer hardware are considered computer hardware engineers. Electronics engineers specialize in areas s uch as communications, signal processing, and control systems or have a specialty within one of these areasindustrial robot control systems or aviation electronics, for example.  Response to the Second Part of the Question:  The engineers will be required  to perform duties as they relate to the types of projects stated in the preceding sentence where the types of engineering disciplines required are specified.  It is up to the individual contractor on how they address this requirement in their submittal. Question:  The solicitation requests the services of Electronic Engineering.  How do the services provided by Electronic Engineering differ from the services of Electrical Engineering also requested?  Response:  See above.  The Project Information portion of the synopsis is changed to read as follows:  2. PROJECT INFORMATION: Projects will primarily be located within the Pittsburgh District.  However, projects may also be located within the geographical boundaries or mission assignments of the USACE Great L akes and Ohio River Division (LRD), or other mission assignments (i.e. Support of Hurricane Relief Operations, etc.) assigned to the Pittsburgh District. The Great Lakes and Ohio River Division includes Buffalo, Chicago, Detroit, Huntington, Louisville, Na shville, and Pittsburgh Districts. The A-E Services to be provided under this contract will be multidisciplinary in nature to support the Pittsburgh District and other LRD organization's mission to plan, design, construct, operate and maintain navigation p rojects (locks and dams), flood control reservoirs and dams, local flood protection projects, river basins, aquatic ecosystem restoration (wetland construction and enhancement, AMD Mitigation, habitat enhancement, urban stream restoration), recreation and other facilities. Services will include, but not be limited to, Mechanical, Electrical, Electronic, Civil, Structural, Specification, Geotechnical, Sanitary, Environmental, Hydrologic and Hydraulic Engineering, Architectural Design and the necessary engine ering support services such as CADD, surveying, value engineering, and cost estimates. The Contractors will be required to provide appropriate personnel, materi als, equipment, management, quality, and cost controls to perform all phases of engineering and architectural services to include, but not be limited to, engineering investigations/studies; designs; reports; construction plans and specifications; prelimina ry cost estimates; general construction and engineering type surveys; and Computer Aided Design and Drafting (CADD).  Work shall be accomplished in full compliance with established Corps of Engineers manuals, policies, standards and practices and other pro fessional practices and standards as necessitated by project conditions or job requirements. Work to be accomplished may be required to be performed using the metric system of measurement.  One other question posed by a prospective offeror, and the respons e are provided below.  Question:  The above solicitation request each firm submit a detailed quality control plan with their proposal.  Is this inclusive of the 125 pages, or can this be included on the CADD sample CD?  Response:  The QC Plan is inclusive in the 125 page limitation.  The CADD sample CD is for CADD drawings only.  The May 15, 2006 response date remains unchanged.

<DESC>Any questions regarding this solicitation should be address to:  Sara L. Jackets (sara.j.jackets@usace.army.mil) or Shannan M. Lewis (shannan.m.lewis@usace.army.mil). The Seattle District Corps of Engineers has a competitive design/build requirement for a project entitled, Replace Family Housing, Phase VII, Mountain Home AFB, Idaho. The objective of this one phase design/build is to obtain housing complete and adequate for assignment as quarters for military personnel and their families.  The scope of work for Phase VII consists of the demolition of 160 existing housing units and the construction of 194 new housing units.  It is important to note that the Government inte nds that the Contractor develop his technical and price proposal to include all new units and demolition within funds available.  Design and construction of this project requires a mixture of two-, three-, and four-bedroom units on Government-owned land at  Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho.  Housing units shall be built per Government-provided conceptual floor plans and elevations, and in accordance with the Government-provided conceptual neighborhood design in the RFP.  Acceptable methods of housing cons truction are site built, off-site component-built, and off-site modular; all methods will be equally acceptable for this project provided that the RFP requirements are met.  Definitions for acceptable type construction practices are as follows: 1) Site Bui lt: Construction wholly or substantially constructed on site.  2) Off-Site, Component-Built: Construction consisting of components, sub-assemblies such as modules, panelized walls, roof trusses, floor joists, and other off-site assembled components, which are transported to the construction site and further assembled into completed housing units.  All interior and exterior walls, regardless of whether they are structural (load bearing) or not, are plant fabricated (panelized).  Panels must be fabricated to the extent that the structure of the panel or truss is factory-assembled.  Interior finish work, such as interior wallboard is site applied.  3) Off-Site, Modular: Construction consisting of  a structure, or sections of a particular structure, constructed and finished in a controlled factory setting and transportable in one of more sections and erected on site.  When assembled, overall structure(s) is built on a permanent foundation and has connected utilities which include plumbing, heating, air conditioni ng and electrical systems contained therein.  Off-site modular construction shall provide a finished structural assembly having the appearance and structural integrity comparable to site-built construction. Total amount of funds available for design, demolition and construction is currently estimated at $52,000,000.00, and the completion period is estimated at 670 calendar days.  The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code has been replaced by the North  American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code.  The NAICS code for this project is 236115, which is matched to SIC Code 1521.  The evaluation method will be a Best Value procurement conducted in accordance with procedures outlined in Federal Acquis ition Regulations (FAR) Part 15.  The solicitation will be a one phase, design/build RFP utilizing best value source selection evaluation procedures to award a fixed-price contract.

<DESC>To Whom It May Concern:

The National Science Foundation (NSF), an independent agency of the United States Government, is seeking information regarding the long-term (10 or more years) availability of icebreaking services capable of enabling the re-supply of the U.S. Antarctic Program’s (USAP) McMurdo Station.  NSF is the U.S. Government Agency responsible for directing and funding the USAP, and manages the entire United States national program in Antarctica, including logistic support activities, so that the program may be managed as a single package.

Background

NSF is interested in contracting for icebreaking services to annually open a channel through 1-2 year 10/10ths sea ice, and then escort an ice-strengthened tanker and an ice-strengthened cargo ship to the pier at McMurdo Station, located at 77°51’ S, 166°40’ E.   NSF intends for this to be a long-term arrangement.   It is expected that a contract would include annual mobilization and de-mobilization periods (length of time to be determined based on location of home port) and an operating period in the Southern Ocean south of 60° S of approximately 6 to 8 weeks.  After that period the vessel would be off-contract and free to engage in other work.

Traditionally, the USAP has relied on the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) to perform the McMurdo break-in and ship escort service using its POLAR class ships.  However, these vessels are 30 years old and are reaching the end of their design life.  NSF is now seeking alternative means of opening the supply channel to McMurdo Station through a reliable long-term arrangement, either with a commercial or governmental provider, or through a multi-national arrangement.     
 
NSF is not seeking binding offers to contract at this time; however, based upon the information received the Foundation may initiate discussions, seek offers, and award a contract with an owner or operator per the authority at 42 U.S.C. 1870(c).


The United States Antarctic Program

Scientific research, and operational support of that research, is the principal activity supported by the United States Government in Antarctica.  The goals are to expand fundamental knowledge of the region, to foster research on global and regional problems of current scientific importance, and to utilize the region as a platform from which to support research.  For projects involving fieldwork, the USAP supports research that can only or can best be done in Antarctica. 

The Program has been in continuous operation since the 1957-1958 International Geophysical Year and continuation into the foreseeable future is anticipated.  U.S. activities in Antarctica support the Nation's adherence to the Antarctic Treaty, which reserves the region for peaceful purposes and encourages international cooperation in scientific research.  At present, 45 nations adhere to the treaty, and 29 of them are involved in Antarctic field activities.  The United States cooperates scientifically and operationally with many of the Antarctic Treaty nations.

The major logistics hub for the support of this science is McMurdo Station.  McMurdo is located on Ross Island in the Southern edge of the Ross Sea.  It is the furthest south exposed land to which a ship can sail.  Refer to http://nsf.gov/od/opp/prss/ for a more complete description of the USAP research support facilities including McMurdo Station.


Typical Schedule and Operations

The icebreaker typically arrives at 60° S on or about December 25.  Anticipated departure from McMurdo is mid-February of the following year (6-8 weeks after arrival).   The basic tasks are to open a channel to the McMurdo Station pier, and escort a tanker and a freighter through the sea ice and channel to the pier and back to the open ocean as required

The freighter to be used during the 2005/2006 season will be the AMERICAN TERN (17,350 tons, 158.8m/23.16m).    The tanker to be used will be one of five sister ships of the T-5 class (33,093 tons, 187.5m/21.2m).   Use of supply ships of similar capacity and size are anticipated over the life of the contract.  Additional information on these vessels may be found at:

http://www.msc.navy.mil/inventory/ships.asp?ship=americantern&type=ContainerShip

… and 

http://www.msc.navy.mil/inventory/ships.asp?ship=paulbuck&type=GovernmentownedTanker.

The U.S. Navy, Military Sealift Command provides these vessels for the USAP.  The tanker arrives at the McMurdo ice edge on or about January 16 each year, and departs on or about January 20 each year.  The freighter arrives at the McMurdo ice edge on or about February 1 each year, and departs on or about February 11 each year.

Sea Ice

The fast ice in McMurdo Sound has typically been between 7 to 10 feet maximum thickness for a distance of 10 to 20 miles from McMurdo.  It is often first or second year ice and had rarely been third year ice until very recently.  Appendix I provides a listing of the extent of sea ice and the vessels used since 1957.   For the past four years there have been extraordinary ice conditions due at least in part to the presence of large icebergs that were partially blocking McMurdo Sound.  For those past four years there has been extensive first year ice with some inclusions of second year ice extending from McMurdo to about 100 miles north.  Ice thicknesses were as great as 12 feet.  Ice in the channel has blown out to open water once in that four-year period, but the surrounding ice extending approximately 14 miles north from McMurdo is multi-year ice.  The two largest of the icebergs have moved out of the area since last year and it is expected that the coming season’s ice should start to return to a more normal status in the short term, but clearly conditions can change rapidly and persist for extended periods.

A chart showing sea ice thickness measurements for 1987 to 2004 is included as Attachment 2.  Recent archival images may be viewed at: http://rapidfire.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/subsets/?RossSea/, and http://www.polar.org/sat_image/

Evaluation Information

Interested parties are free to provide any information that they believe may assist NSF in its evaluation of the availability and reliability of icebreaking services; however, the Foundation will not pay for any information submitted.  Except as identified herein, no specific format is required.  

Among the evaluation factors that NSF would consider in determining suitability of an existing or to-be-built vessel for icebreaking services would be:

·	Vessel’s ice classification and maximum ice thickness and speed of advance for continuous progress
·	Vessel’s displacement
·	Statement of availability
·	Ship’s registry
·	Vessel’s or vessels’ name and specifications using BIMCO Supplytime 89, Annex A as the format
·	Name/address of vessel’s owner and vessel’s operator (if different)
·	Certificate of current classification
·	Time remaining prior to any major maintenance activity and dry docking
·	Approximate price per day, and any extras (e.g., taxes, victuals, commissions, communications)
·	Expected mobilization and demobilization charges and port of initiation/return
·	Past performance contact information
·	Special operating restrictions or conditions

It is highly desirable that the vessel have sufficient fuel storage to complete the entire Antarctic operation without any re-fueling from McMurdo.  Please specifically indicate whether the intended vessel has the fuel storage capacity to enable this.  

If the vessel must receive fuel during the period of time while operating in the Southern Ocean, McMurdo can provide an all purpose diesel fuel, JP-5.  Specifications for this fuel are set forth on Page 4 of the publication titled Fuel Users Guide, 2000.  It can be found at http://usapc.army.mil/miscellaneous/2000%20fuel%20users%20guide%20(sep%202000).pdf.  Respondents are asked to review this fuel specification and comment on its suitability.  If another diesel fuel must be used (e.g. MGO or MDO), NSF can have it delivered by the tanker coming to McMurdo.  Please provide an estimate of the quantity of fuel that must be delivered (fuel consumed during mobilization and during ice breaking operations up to the time of the scheduled tanker arrival).  There is no tankage for storage of specialty fuels in McMurdo, thus the fuel must be delivered directly from the tanker.  The tanker cannot deliver heavy fuels.  

Where fuel is expected to be provided at McMurdo, appropriate adjustments shall be made to the approximate price per day.

In the event of a need for heavy fuel, if necessary, the icebreaker could go to New Zealand to refuel – this will take time away from icebreaking duties and is not desirable.  Respondents are asked to indicate if this mode of refueling will be required. 

The Committee of Managers of National Antarctic Programs (COMNAP) is currently developing ballast water management plans for the Antarctic.  A draft management plan is attached.  Please comment on your ability to comply with this plan.


Thank you in advance for your interest in the acquisition programs of the National Science Foundation.  Though NSF will consider any information interested parties choose to submit at any time, the privilege of your submission on or prior to February 28, 2006 is requested.  Inquiries of a technical nature may be addressed to Mr. Michael Van Woert, Executive Officer, Office of Polar Programs, at the letterhead address, Room 755; by telephone to +1 (703) 292-8030; or by e-mail to mvanwoer@nsf.gov.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE FOR THE UNITED STATES COAST GUARD (USCG) RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CENTER (RDC) IN GROTON, CT.   This is not a solicitation and there are no current plans to issue a solicitation.  This Request For Information is part of a market research effort to assess industry capabilities that will best address the USCG’s need.  The USCG RDC is chartered to conduct research, development, testing and evaluation activities. 

The USCG RDC is contemplating closing its Fire & Safety Test Detachment, Mobile, AL thereby eliminating its capability to conduct in-house full-scale shipboard fire tests.  The USCG RDC needs to identify test laboratories capable of performing the research currently being done at the Fire & Safety Test Detachment, Mobile, AL.  The RDC also needs to understand the potential costs that will be incurred when using such a laboratory.

The USCG RDC is looking for a test laboratory capable of conducting full scale marine fire tests needed to support its fire research projects to: (1) assist CG regulatory decisions regarding approval of fire protections systems for maritime vessels; and (2) support CG positions regarding recommendations to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) regarding its various fire test protocols.

The replacement laboratory would need the capability to conduct full scale fire tests to evaluate the fire protection/extinguishing capability of various fire protection/prevention components/systems (e.g., foams, aerosols, gaseous agents, dry chemicals, and water sprays).  The laboratory shall have the capability to conduct fire test scenarios involving machinery spaces, cargo holds, passenger staterooms, and large (e.g., 50ft x 50ft) pool fires.  The test areas must be realistic in configuration to the space it would be duplicating on a vessel.

The laboratory shall be capable of generating four principal test scenarios:  
1.  It must have the capability to create a large (e.g., 3,000 cubic meter) cargo hold having two levels to conduct large volume testing of fire protection extinguishing testing.  The cargo hold shall be of steel construction, include fire doors and a ventilation system. 
2.  It must have the capability to conduct International Maritime Organization fire suppression testing in their standard 500 cubic meter test chamber complete with ventilation system, engine mockup, and openings.  They must be able to handle a range of agents including high expansion foam, aerosols, and Halon-alternatives.
3.  It must have the capability to conduct compartment tests (i.e., basic room size for passenger ship, e.g.10 ft x 10ft x 8 ft) to evaluate furnishings and bunk components.
4.  It must also have the capability to conduct large (e.g., 50 ft x 50 ft) pool fires which can be used to evaluate fire suppression of different foams.  

The laboratory shall have the capability to write a test plan for evaluating fire protection/prevention systems, conduct the tests, record and analyze the data, and write the final report.  The laboratory shall determine which fire protection components/systems to be tested, purchase the systems, and insure they were installed to manufacturer specifications for the testing.  The laboratory shall have the capability to install instrumentation to measure various fire parameters (e.g., temperature, heat flux, different gas concentrations) and record the data for analysis. 

When responding to this market research, please provide the following information:  (A) A cost estimate to construct the IMO test chamber (e.g., steel, materials, ventilation systems, drains, doors and labor) in Marine Safety Committee Circular (MSC Cir.) 848., (B) an estimated cost of conducting the test procedures in MSC/Cir. 848; and (C) an estimated cost of chamber removal if the chamber cannot be left in place at the laboratory.  (D) Estimated costs associated with engineering services, technician rates, heavy duty equipment rates, as well as instrumentation and computer rates.  (E) Can test structures (e.g., cargo hold, IMO chamber, passenger compartment, steel structures for pool fires) be left intact or stored (i.e. preserved) for future testing/use to reduce construction and breakdown fees?  (F) Most fire projects involve two weeks of testing per year, can this duration of testing be supported at one time or will it need to be broken up into shorter time increments?  (G) Normally the CG RDC conducts one to two test projects per year with each test series being two weeks in duration.  Does test scheduling require long lead times by the laboratory?  (H) Most test laboratories conduct standardized tests.  Can test laboratory deviate from standardized tests based on direction provided by onsite USCG test representative who is observing ongoing tests/results and makes suggested changes?  Please limit electronic response to no more than 15 pages.

Responses to this market survey shall be sent directly to Dave.E.Beene@uscg.mil with a copy to Helen.R.Nelson@uscg.mil.  Only electronic responses will be accepted and shall be submitted no later 16 June 2006.   With regard to the NAICS, please identify if you are a Small or Large Business.   PHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED AND MESSAGES LEFT WILL NOT BE RETURNED.

Closing Date: May 18, 2006

POC:   Shirley Baldwin, (202) 712-0265, M/OAA/GRO/EGAS
	
Background:

USAID missions in Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Pakistan are undertaking large construction projects in response to the tsunami and earthquake disasters.  USAID seeks to strengthen staff skills in the areas of engineering and construction contracting through a course design and delivery that addresses unique elements of these types of federal contracting.  

General Description:

USAID is seeking Letters of Interest in the design, development, and classroom presentation of a course entitled “Federal Engineering and Construction Contracting.”  It is anticipated that the final course will be conducted once in Indonesia and once in Sri Lanka in the fall of 2006.
The contractor will design, develop materials and conduct a course to train 20-30 USAID participants per session in the structure and applicability of federal and USAID regulations, statutes, procedures, policies, and best practices in engineering and construction contracts in international environments.  

The overall learning objective of the course is to improve participants’ knowledge and skills necessary to plan, award, and administer federal (and in particular, USAID) engineering and construction contracts abroad.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has a requirement for a study on Exhaled Nitric Oxide (eNO) Dose-Response.  This announcement is a Sources Sought Synopsis.  Its purpose is to generate responses from qualified 8(a), HUBZONE, veteran owned, or small business concerns, which have the interest and the ability to perform a study intended to evaluate the exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) dose-response of asthmatic patients.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 541710.  Contractors interested in this requirement must submit a capability statement.  Capability statements should include a description of your organization’s experience and ability to respond to the objective of the study which is eNO, a marker of airway inflammation which is a potential pharmacodynamic endpoint for evaluating the delivery of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) to the lung.  The proposed study is intended to evaluate eNO dose-response.  Design aspects include: examine the magnitude of dose-response for fluticasone propionate ICS using eNO as a marker of drug response; examine subject screening criteria for study enrichment; examine intra subject variability, which in combination with the magnitude of dose-response, will allow estimation of the number of patients required in a BE study; and examine the dose duration and washout period needed between doses that gives the most significant dose-response. 

The study has been divided into two phases. Phase I shall evaluate a dose of 200 mcg/day (dosed as 100 mcg twice daily) during and after the treatment phase.  As part of the study, patient’s eNO will be monitored to evaluate how long it takes for eNO levels to return to near-baseline levels. 

Phase II shall be a four way crossover study with suggested doses of 100,200, and 800 mcg/day, dosed twice daily, and a replicate 200 mcg/day dose, dosed twice daily.  The washout period between doses will be determined from the results of Phase I.  Placebo doses will be used to blind subjects to dose.

The FDA anticipates a two year contract will be awarded.

Interested contractors shall provide (1) a summary list of similar work previously performed or being performed; (2) a brief statement of project accomplishments which state the outcomes and impacts of these activities; (3) the professional qualifications and specific experience of staff who may be assigned to the requirement; (4) description of your facility required including laboratory space, analytical instrumentation, and access to an IRB; and (5) resumes for proposed key personnel should be included in the capability statement, if available; (6) any other specific and pertinent information as pertains to this Sources Sought that would enhance FDA’s consideration and evaluation of the information submitted.  Responses must reference Request for Information (RFI) FDA-SOL-06-00205 and include the following:  (1) name and address of firm, (2) type of business (i.e.: small business, small disadvantaged 8(a) certified, HUBZONE, woman-owned small business, small disadvantaged business (not 8(a) certified), veteran-owned small business, disabled veteran owned business, etc.) (3) two points of contact:  name, title, phone, fax and e-mail, (4) DUNS number, (5) NAICS codes, (6) contractor’s capabilities statement which provides the information stated above, (7) list of customers covering the past 5 years including a summary of similar such work, by contract number, contract type, dollar value for each customer, reference and customer point of contact with phone number, and identify your role as either the prime contractor or subcontractor and (8) a statement that the contractor has registered in the central contractor registration (ccr) data base (http://www.ccr.gov).

The findings of the preliminary market research will be used in considering a 100% set aside for 8a businesses, pursuant to the set-aside authority contained in Public Law 108-183, the Veterans Benefits Act of 2003, as implemented in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 19.8. NAICS code for this acquisition is 237990.  The Size Standard is $28.5 Million.  The magnitude of this project is between $10,000,000 and $20,000,000.

(f) State whether or not there were any performance issues under the contract which resulted in the issuance of a Cure Notice or Show Cause Notice by the contracting officer. (2)  In order to determine if an acquisition can be set-aside for 8a businesses, the contracting officer must determine that there are a sufficient number of 8a businesses capable of performing the contract requirement and that award can be made at a reasonable, fair market price.  To that end, please provide your firm's individual and aggregate contract bonding capacity. (3)  Has your firm ever been terminated for cause or default from a contractual arrangement, whether Federal or private sector, as a result of failure to perform, poor quality and workmanship provided, etc.?  If so, please provide the specifics. (4)  Has your firm, or any firm that you would potentially joint venture or team with for a large acquisition of construction services or for any acquisition, ever bid on a Federal acquisition and been determined non-responsible by the contracting officer and the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) failed to issue a Certificate of Competency (COC) to your firm or teaming partners when the matter was referred to SBA for review and consideration? Please e-mail your responses and any relevant information regarding specific performance or other qualifications regarding the construction services requested, no later than May 15, 2006 to Candace Wood at Candace.Wood@va.gov  Do not send hard copy advertising or promotional materials.

There is no entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs related to or arising out of responding to this request for information.  All information provided becomes property of the Government.  There is no guarantee, expressed or implicit, that the market research for this acquisition will result in a 8A Business set-aside or 8A Business sole source award, or any other guarantee of award or acquisition strategy.

<SUBJECT>Z -- Replacement of the Earle Cabell Federal Building’s Fire Alarm System
<DESC>In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, and under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), the General Services Administration, Public Building Service, Dallas Service Center intends to solicit the six known local installers of Notifier Fire Alarm Systems in the Dallas/Fort Worth area for a competitive procurement, on an other than full and open basis.  The Government’s requirement is for the replacement of the Earle Cabell Federal Building’s Fire Alarm System, at 1100 Commerce Street, Dallas, TX with a Class A, Notifier Fire Alarm System, to be installed by a certified Notifier installer.  This is a firm requirement based on the fact that the connected federal building has recently been equipped with a Notifier brand Fire Alarm System.  Therefore, in order to be able to connect and communicate between alarm panels and systems, components need to be from the same manufacturer to assure inter-operability and compatibility.  Notifier manufactured equipment, like virtually all fire alarm systems on the market, are proprietary in nature, to include both hardware and software components. They also require the use of manufacturer certified installers.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.   No solicitation packages will be available, except to the known local installers of Notifier Fire Alarm Systems.  A determination to provide for other than full and open competition is within the sole discretion of the Government.

<SUBJECT>Z -- Sole Source Intent:  Facade Repair & Cleaning, Buffalo NY
<DESC>The government intends to contract on a sole-source basis with The Tradesman Group, Inc. of Dublin, OH pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 657f and 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(5).  This notice may be of potential interest to other Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB) within NAICS code 238140; Masonry Contractors (size standard $13.0 million).  These or other parties are requested to clearly identify their interest to the points of contact below.  The project location is the Michael J. Dillon U.S. Courthouse, 68 Court Street, Buffalo, NY.  Work includes, but is not limited to, the repair and replacement of caulk joints, re-pointing of damaged and missing mortar joints, repair of spalled limestone, repainting of door and window frames and cleaning of the building surface.  The estimated magnitude of the construction project is between $500,000 and $1 million.  Previous market research indicates that The Tradesman Group is the only SDVOSB masonry contractor capable of performing this specialized work.  The basis for this conclusion is the building’s high level of historical significance and present condition in combination with the contractor’s depth of project experience with similar restorations and favorable record of past performance.  Any responses to this notice should be prepared in strict accordance with Numbered Notes 22 and 29 and will be similarly processed by the government.

NOTIFICATION OF PLANNED SOLICITATION

ENGINEERING PLANT OPERATORS CONTINUUM (EPOC)

On 2 March 2006, NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division posted a Sources/Sought Market Survey stipulating the need for the following requirement: “to support the Center for Naval Engineering (CNE) acquiring the development of asynchronous self-paced training materials for use in the Navy - Integrated Learning Environment (ILE). In the execution of their broad and diverse mission, CNE has a requirement to provide a revised/enhanced, scenario-based curriculum in a self-paced interactive delivery format for the Journeyman skill level engineer(s) referred to as Engineering Plant Operators Course (EPOC). The current training is delivered via approximately 119 instructor-lead C, D, F, and G schools. The EPOC product to be purchased under this contract is to enhance cognitive skill development through a blended solution of re-engineered delivery techniques for Surface Engineering personnel assigned to the fleet.  EPOC is to address the operator and maintenance skill objects required by the Surface Engineers of the Navy’s non-nuclear shipboard propulsion and auxiliary systems. This effort seeks to enhance the course through reduction of the instructor-led, classroom-based portion by delivering initial instruction and refresher training via self-paced Interactive Multimedia Instruction (IMI). As a result, this effort will require that all forms of instructional strategies, assessment strategies, delivery methods and media be considered in order to provide learning activities and events that will support learning behaviors at the highest level of cognition, including application, synthesis, and evaluation.”

The purpose for this announcement is to notify industry of the disposition for the EPOC Project, since the posting of the Sources Sought/Market Survey dated 2 March 2006.  The Government extends its appreciation to all the organizations that took time to response to the EPOC DRAFT Statement of Work (SOW).

Statement of Work

TITLE:  Establishing the Governance Model for the DHAP Division within the National Center for HIV, STD and TB Prevention
					
I.  BACKGROUND 

This project is a follow-on to a previous project that involved analyzing and providing recommendations relating to the appropriateness of the organizational structure of DHAP.  Previous recommendations include:  (1) maintaining one division and making changes to the organizational structure and division functions, maximizing strengths and adjusting the functions of leaders, e.g.,  increasing the number of deputy positions and changing titles, and reporting relationships to increase branch interaction and responsiveness to partner constituency;  (2) expanding Director authority and responsibility, e.g. 90% of day-to-day decisions made as Director/Branch Chief level rather than Division Director; and  (3) increasing the role of the Division Associate Directors.  This function will allow for leading crosscutting issues within the division and serve as liaisons for increased inter-branch communication and cooperation.  Based on subject matter expertise, ongoing teams can be developed to increase communication, involve partners in relevant issues, increase dialogue to avoid duplication of efforts or voids in activities, identify emerging issues to increase proactivity and decrease reactivity in response and anticipation.  The ultimate goal is to improve branch support, enhance communication, and increase responsiveness to partners, deadlines, crises, and emerging issues.  

This project will guide the implementation of the new DHAP alignment.  As new responsibilities are created for the entire Division leadership group and specific authority is delegated to Deputy Division Directors and Associate Directors, a structured program of implementation will be necessary to further enhance the leadership capacity of the Division personnel.  Phase I of the project will establish the governance model and organizational structure for DHAP.  Phase II of the project will guide the implementation of the new DHAP alignment.  As new responsibilities are created for the entire Division leadership group and specific authority is delegated to Deputy Division Directors and Associate Directors, a structured program of implementation will be necessary to further enhance the leadership capacity of the Division personnel.

<DESC>The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) intends to award on a sole source basis, a purchase order to Virginia Diodes, Inc. (VDI) of Charlottesville, VA for the  following item:  one (1) each P/N: WR-0.65 (X9) Frequency Extension Module, Specifications are: Output/input power: 0.002/30mW typical from 1420-1500THz; Configuration: {WR-1.9X3} + {WR-0.65X3}; Input flange: WR-5.7, UG-387/U-M; Output horn: smooth-walled feedhorn, gain 22Db (nom.).  Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory currently uses Virginia Diode multiplier modules for the Submillimeter Array Project, Antenna Receiver, on the summit of Mauna Kea, Hawaii.  The current modules used, are in the lower frequency range (below 1 THz) and have proven to be a reliable product. Virginia Diodes has developed a new series of fixed tuned multipliers at 1THz that are based on planar diodes vs. the point of contact diodes used previously. These newer multiplier modules are more reliable because they do not require mechanical backshort and the elimination of the point of contact results in a less fragile, more robust unit. After performing market research, SAO has concluded that there is no commercial device currently manufactured that provides the features of this device and meets SAO's requirement.  Contractors interested in this requirement should submit a complete technical package that provides clear and convincing evidence that they can meet SAO's requirement. A determination by SAO not to compete this proposed purchase order, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of SAO.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This procurement is 100% set-aside for small business, class code: 3345, size standard: 750.  Delivery is six (6) weeks ARO.  This acquisition is being conducted under the guidelines as set forth in the simplified acquisition procedures (SAP). No written solicitation will be issued for this requirement. Anticipated award date is 31 may 06

JUSTIFICATION:  

This acquisition is proprietary in nature.  The procurement items are to upgrade the current MKS system while retaining the mission essential software development documentation stored in the software tool.  The emergence of improved software development tools such as Oracle JDeveloper places AFRS in a situation which requires it to update the current version of its configuration control software because the version of MKS being utilized does not support the version control of software documentation created and maintained with Oracle JDeveloper.  As AFRS has directed the usage of Oracle JDeveloper for its future releases of the Air Force Information Support System (AFRISS) used by all Air Force Recruiters worldwide, the current version of MKS must be updated.  Over the past five years all configuration control documentation has been stored in the current version of MKS software.  This documentation is mission essential and must be migrated in order to sustain software development operations.  The requirement to migrate mission essential software documentation from the current MKS system into MKS Integrity Suite makes MKS uniquely qualified to complete the migration as MKS is the only company known whick can provide an upgrade to our current product.  Additionally, MKS is uniquely qualified to provide installation and training instruction as they are the only known certified instructors of MKS Integrity Suite.  


CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS

HSAR 3052-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [DEC 2003]   [Full Text Follows]
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  “Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.   Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.     If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.     The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.     Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d) (2).     If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Response Alternatives for Technical Services (RATS) is a program developed by the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) to satisfy its growing need for surge capacity.  In response to numerous disasters worldwide, it became clear that OFDA could not find, in a timely manner, adequate staff to cover all positions in the field and in Washington, and to backfill for permanent staff deploying to the field.  OFDA’s Senior Management Team (SMT) approved a program which would bring on board select candidates who could work on a part-time basis, for no more than 250 days per calendar year, and be deployed within hours to facilitate OFDA’s response to disasters.  RATS positions are contracted for an initial period of one year with the option to extend up to five years.

INTRODUCTION

OFDA is the office within the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA).  OFDA is organized into three divisions, under the management of the Office of the Director.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (OFDA/DRM) is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  OFDA/DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations.  OFDA/DRM employs sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Program Support Division (OFDA/PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA’s Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OFDA/OPS) develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OFDA/OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, Disaster Assistance Support Program (DASP), Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

The RATS program is managed by the Overseas Administration Team (OAT) in the OFDA/OPS.  This team maintains a database for all contracted RATS, providing information to the rest of the office on their availability, skills and previous OFDA experience.  The OAT assists the program offices within OFDA in choosing the best qualified RATS for any specific task, and provides administrative and personnel support to existing RATS.  Each RATS incumbent will provide enhancement to the OFDA team according to his/her skills.  They will be considered part of OFDA/Washington resources that can be deployed worldwide.  At times they may also be a resource for the DCHA Bureau.  Foreign language ability in one or more major world languages is preferred.

OBJECTIVES

The SMT has determined that OFDA needs to maintain a roster of 50 to 75 RATS to meet its surge capacity objectives.  Each incumbent will be deployable to backfill Washington positions, to be assigned to field offices for staff enhancement, to serve on DARTs and RMTs as disaster response demands, and to assess critical situations as warranted.

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

All RATS will be responsible for performing all or some of the tasks below; however, all work will be done in coordination with OFDA personnel.  RATS are considered U.S. Government (USG) employees, and, as such, are required to further USG foreign policy objectives.

RATS respond to humanitarian emergencies - natural, technological and conflict-related disasters - as required, worldwide.  The contractor may serve in the OFDA Washington offices as staff enhancement when critical shortages of staff occur and on RMTs, which provide program, administrative, technical and logistics support to OFDA DARTs from Washington.  The contractor may also be required to travel on short notice as a critical component of a USG disaster assessment team or a DART or to backfill staff members in OFDA regional or program offices overseas.

* Coordinate and manage oversight of OFDA-funded activities to ensure the proper use of OFDA program funds.  Monitor financial statements from the grantee(s) and the timeliness and quality of response(s);
* Identify disaster mitigation measures where appropriate that could be linked to disaster response activities.  Review mitigation principles and recommend course(s) of action to OFDA/Washington staff;
* Develop various types of country/regional strategies for field offices, DARTs and assessment teams.  Provide briefings and written reports as required;
* Conduct personnel-related activities, property management, safety and security assessments, supply management, contracting services, leasing, travel, and records management, as needed and when tasked;
* Coordinate delivery of relief supplies provided by OFDA. Ensure that distribution is carried out in accordance with USAID policies and regulations and with OFDA strategies;
* Interpret USAID policies and apply them to OFDA activities as appropriate;
* Determine availability of support resources including staff, equipment, storage, office space, and communications; identify the obligating authority for procurement of supplies, commodities and services;
* Participate in appropriate training either as a participant and/or trainer;
* Operate DART communications equipment and operate a four-wheel drive or standard-shift vehicle in cross-country conditions;
* Provide expert advice to OFDA DARTs, RMTs, regional missions, and/or OFDA’s Washington-based staff on humanitarian issues for populations at risk in conflict, disaster affected, or otherwise food-insecure areas;
* Foster an effective team environment; guide and coordinate the work of other team members when serving as Response Manager, DART Leader, or other supervisory capacity;
* Adhere strictly to Embassy and Mission security guidelines; coordinate all travel with the DART Leader, the DART Security Officer, the USAID Executive Officer (EXO) and/or the Washington-based RMT.

INTRODUCTION:  This document defines the scope of work, with deliverables, to be accomplished by the Contractor for the Department of the Interior (DOI). Scope of Work U.S. Department of the Interior International Technical Assistance Program For International Workshop on Economics of Natural Protected Areas General Description.  The Contractor shall furnish all services, materials, supplies, instruction and travel as required, in connection with the work described herein.  The workshop shall be in accordance with all instructions as set forth in this contract.  The Scope of Work shall consist of a 5-day workshop to instruct 25 professional government and non-government participants on economics of natural resources in relation to natural protected areas in Peru. The training will occur in or within a 1-hour drive from Lima, Peru.  This contract will be completed as a single event workshop to instruct staff from the Government of Peru on economic themes as they relate to natural protected areas.  The Contractor shall implement one 5-day workshop in or within a 1-hour drive from Lima, Peru that will provide technical training on the economics of natural resources, which includes the analysis of environmental values, micro-economics, and cost-benefit analysis.     Background. The U.S. Department of the Interior's (DOI) International Technical Assistance Program (ITAP), with funding from the U.S. Agency for International Development/Peru  (USAID/Peru), is providing training and technical assistance in support of USAID/Peru's protected area management efforts with the National Institute of Natural Resources (INRENA).  DOI intends to issue a contract to provide a 5-day training workshop for 25 participants from INRENA resource management staff and representatives from other government agencies involved in resource management.  Specific economic themes will include analysis of environmental values, micro-economics, economics of natural resources, and cost-benefit analysis. Currently, INRENA is faced with extreme budgetary shortfalls in managing protected areas. Generally, visitor fees from protected areas in Peru generate only about 10 percent of the revenue needed to manage those areas.  DOI is working with INRENA staff to improve the budgetary support of protected areas by using economic tools to estimate the actual and potential importance of Peru's system of protected areas versus current expenditures for their use and protection.  The purpose of this action would be to help INRENA demonstrate and justify the need for greater budget allocations for the management of protected areas.  It is anticipated that a comprehensive valuation of protected areas, and improved management and control, would yield economic returns to the Government of Peru that would more than offset the higher costs of management and control.  INRENA is directed to manage a system of protected areas under the Protected Natural Areas Law (No. 26834) of 1997.  In 2003, INRENA was responsible for managing 57 protected areas totaling 12.7 percent of the surface area of Peru.  These areas include 10 National Parks, 9 National Reserves, and 13 Reserve Zones.  In all, there are 9 categories of protection that total 16 million hectares.   INRENA is in need of additional economic support to finance the management of the 57 protected areas.  One of the first steps in developing budgetary support for protected areas is to train INRENA staff and other Peruvian government agency staff in the economics of natural protected areas.  DOI is looking to initiate this workshop to provide training to INRENA staff on cost-benefit analyses for protected areas.  DOI is also looking to provide general guidance to participants on the economics of natural areas, with the expected outcome that participants will leave with a very high level of understanding of economic benefits provided by natural protected areas.  Scope of Work. The Contractor shall provide an intensive 5-day workshop divided into two sections: (1) one-day training for representatives of all identified government agencies involved in resource management, covering economic themes in an overview workshop style (to occur during first day of workshop); (2) training for INRENA staff only, with training focused in more detail on economics of natural resources and cost-benefit analysis (to occur during remaining 4 days of workshop). Topics covered will include:  tools to effectively analyze environmental values and apply micro-economics and conduct cost-benefit analyses in the management of protected areas; pitfalls and issues with economics of natural resources; and conducting economic evaluations of protected areas.  The training provided will consist of a combination of presentations, exercises, market simulations, analysis of local data, and evaluations of protected areas.  Specific economic themes will include analysis of environmental values, micro-economics, economics of natural resources, and cost-benefit analysis.   The workshop will also provide training on environmental resource value determination, market and politics in conserving environmental resources, and the environmental economy.  The first day of the workshop will provide an introduction of economic methods for improved conservation of biodiversity and the management of natural resources.   The contractor must develop class exercises for this workshop that are specific to Peru and can be applied to natural protected areas in Peru.  The contractor must present the workshop in Spanish and provide written materials for the class in Spanish.   The contractor must guide participants through an application of benefit-cost analysis for a selected protected area in Peru.  This is especially important, since workshop participants will need to take the skills learned in the course and apply them to newly created protected areas within Peru. Minimum Qualifications of Contractor.  The contractor must demonstrate 3 years of experience working with Latin American governments within the realm of natural resource economics.  The contractor must also have a minimum of 3 years of experience working internationally with natural resource government agencies.

<DESC>This equipment has the unique capability of enabling near infrared transmittance measurements along line of sight through any test location of laser eye protection and may be integrated with our current automated luminous transmittance(LT) test station.  This spectrometer has proven high resolution and immediate integrability with existing optical fiber equipment, sample motion control and measurement/analysis.  Near infrared transmittance is critical to monitoring performance of laser eye protection in this region of the spectrum.  Currently this is measured with an existing spectrometer (AVIV 14DS) which does not easily accommodate sample motion.  The AVIV 14DS is used because it remains the only spectrometer capable of measuring transmittance beyond 1027 nanometers (which is the upper limit of our current automated LT test station) and the infrared protection requires monitoring out to at least 1600 nanometers. This new capability will permit more thorough and rapid testing of laser eye protection particularly for Joint Advance Laser Eye Protecitn Visor.
