Services:   The National Institutes of Health Information and Technology Acquisition and Assessment Center (NITAAC) requires the services of a NON-PROFIT organization that can support information technology investment decision analysis and technical IT assistance. Because of the nature of the follow-on work resulting from award of the NITAAC contracts the use of for-profit, commercial contractors is inappropriate.  NITAAC's requirements are such that performance by a for-profit contractor would exclude them from competing on subsequent efforts for similar work in the same area due to detailed insider knowledge of the project.

NITAAC requires the services of an organization that can, through the business practices it adopts, provide continuing, essential, conflict of interest free services which support information technology investment decision analysis and technical assistance utilizing a general systems engineering and integration approach under their current Government-wide Agency Contracts.  Acquiring this non-profit support will provide NITAAC with unbiased and timely systems and economic analyses, strategic and program planning, and acquisition support.  This action also supports NITAAC in fully meeting the requirements of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, mandating each Federal agency to implement a process for maximizing the value and assessing and managing the risks of agency information technology acquisitions and our Executive Agency Authority granted in 2000 through 2002.  The non-profit contractor shall have unique business characteristics that can provide essential capabilities to conduct explorative studies, independent investment decision analyses, business process reengineering, strategic planning, and IT systems analysis.

DITA operates the NIH Information Technology Acquisition and Assessment Center (NITAAC) and NITAAC currently manages two Task Order Government-Wide Agency Contracts (GWACs): Chief Information Officer - Solutions and Partners-2 Innovation (CIO-SP 2i) and Image World-2 New Dimensions (IW2ND). The Contractor will assist NIH Contracting and Project Officers in reviewing requirements identified by potential clients and proposals returned for same. 

Each of NITAACs two Task Order GWACs has multiple contracts. The Contractor will be required to provide appropriate personnel with the skill sets specified in this Statement of Work.  A labor skill mix needs to be supplied to review the technical functionality and adequacy of clients' task order requests and contractors' proposals, with appropriate attention to task order source selection plans and methodologies for contract award. General analytical studies will also be performed by CTAs in the administration and management of the contracts. In addition, CTAs will assist NIH Contracting and Project Officers in enterprise process improvement, activity reporting, process automation, and acquisition regulation compliance.  The Contractor shall assist the Government in executing NITAAC's strategic plans by identifying required activities and transitioning them into tactical operations that guide NITAAC in the conduct of major systems engineering analysis and acquisition.  The Contractor shall assist NITAAC in conducting special studies that specifically require a company that has a set of conflict-free business practices and has no proprietary interest in any particular solution. The Contractor shall assist NITAAC in conducting requirements analysis.  The Contractor shall assist NITAAC in conducting requirements traceability.  The purpose of requirements traceability is to permit the progressive identification of mission needs, operational requirements, and design specification.  The Contractor shall assist NITAAC in conducting criticality analyses of program requirements.  The results of criticality analyses will be used to prioritize, monitor and evaluate NITAAC's efforts pertaining to development and program phases to derive greatest cost benefits. The Contractor shall perform functional analysis/allocation to the level of depth needed to support required system products and processes design effort. The Contractor shall assist NITAAC to successively (highest to lower level) establish performance requirements for each functional requirements and interface.  The Contractor shall assist NITAAC in system conceptual design phase to determine feasibility and define product and process solution in terms of design requirements that satisfy the functional architecture and integrate the physical architecture.  The Contractor shall assist NITAAC in system concept analysis to satisfy operational requirements and program objectives, and to provide a rigorous quantitative basis for performance, functional and design requirement.  The Contractor shall assist NITAAC in system concept planning to satisfy overall program objectives. The Contractor shall assist NITAAC in the development of policy and/or tailoring or selection of specifications and standards for qualitative and quantitative risk management, and in the performance of specific risk management processes. A fixed rate cost reimbursement contract is anticipated.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to award a single source contract in accordance with FAA AMS 3.2.2.4 to Mosaic ATM to provide program development/management, computer programming and engineering support services for the Operations Planning, Technology Development, ATO-P. This contract will bridge a shortfall in contract support to ATO-P due to the fact that the current support contract will expire on September 30, 2006.  The existing support contract was expected for a longer period of performance; however, due to circumstances beyond the control of the program office, the support will be ending September 30, 2006.  Therefore a single source contract for a 9 month period of performance in the amount of $975,000 is being pursued.  A follow-on competitive procurement is planned for award in FY 2007. Mosaic ATM is the company that has the combination of skills needed and the proven track record to satisfy the FAA's requirement to provide Surface Decision Support System (SDSS) engineering and technical support services to ATO-P in a timely manner with no learning curve necessary.  It has been determined that it is in the best interest of the FAA to acquire these engineering support services on a single-source basis from Mosaic ATM for the following reasons: Mosaic ATM has extensive, direct experience in the management and technical development of the Surface Decision Support System (SDSS).  One key component of SDSS development is the uninterrupted development and on-site support at the ATO-P test facility in Louisville, Kentucky.  This facility, which was established and is maintained by Mosaic ATM, currently resides within a corporate information technology system.  There is considerable sensitivity on the part of the corporate partner in this effort to access and knowledge of their networks and information technology system.  The present Mosaic ATM staff has developed a high level of trust and cooperation with the corporate partner. The extensive Mosaic ATM expertise in SDSS technology is also applicable to the development of system, software, and hardware engineering services in the design and development of a demonstration remote tower system concept.  The remote tower concept will integrate inputs from various automation and surveillance systems and provide display and operator interface to enable tower operations from off-site locations.  Mosaic ATM is intimately involved in the current planning and demonstration efforts that are on very short time lines and small budgets. A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement.  If your firm does not agree with this single source determination, please provide evidence of your firm's capability and experience and the FAA will evaluate that information accordingly.  All responses to this announcement must be directed to Sue Handy, Contracting Officer by 3:00 P.M., Eastern Time, August 23, 2006.

<RESPDATE>092006
<ARCHDATE>03202007
<CONTACT>Philip Murphy, Contracting Officer, 505-234-7465, Philip.Murphy@wipp.ws;Diane Snow, Contract Specialist, 505-234-7326, diane.snow@wipp.ws
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy, Carlsbad Field Office (CBFO), Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) program, intends to extend the period of performance of contract numbers DE-AC29-00AL66471 and DE-AC29-00AL66336 with CAST Specialty, Inc. (CAST) and Bed Rock, Inc. d/b/a Tri-State Motor Transit Company (TSMT) on a sole source bridge basis to provide uninterrupted support while the follow-on procurement numbered DE-RP30-06EW20001 is competed and awards are made. The extension will continue the performance period by one month and shall include 5 one-month option periods. The extended period of performance will be from October 27, 2006 through November 26, 2006 and if all five options are exercised the period of performance will extend through April 26, 2007. This extension is being made noncompetitively based on the exclusion found at Federal Acquisition Regulation, FAR 6.302 1 a, which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements within the required time-frame. To DOEâ€™s knowledge and belief, only CAST and TSMT have the requisite specialized equipment and highly specialized technical experience and training to ensure that the CBFOâ€™s requirements are met within the required delivery schedules. The strict contract requirements for drivers making transuranic (TRU) waste shipments to WIPP that are included in an agreement between the Secretary of Energy and the Southern States Energy Board (SSEB) and the Western Governorsâ€™ Association (WGA) result in it taking a long period of time for a contractor to hire drivers and complete an extensive training program (requiring 90 to 120 days) before a contractor can use new drivers to make WIPP shipments.  In addition, the contractsâ€™ tractor specifications are much more stringent than the industry standard requiring tractors being utilized under the contracts to be specially ordered thereby requiring at least several months for a contractor to procure or lease tractors that may be used to make WIPP shipments.  Due to the long period of time required for a new contractor to transition and initiate WIPP TRU waste shipments these services are available only from the existing contractors.  No other firms have the requisite equipment, training, experience and capability to assume the critical, highly specialized transportation support without causing an interruption in services. The present contracts with CAST and TSMT end on October 26, 2006; THERE ARE NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS AVAILABLE FOR THE EXTENSION OF THESE TWO CONTRACTS. Interested, responsible sources may submit information regarding their capability to perform this requirement, which shall be considered by the Department. Information received will be considered for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive acquisition. CAST and TSMT currently provide approximately 30 TRU waste shipments per week to WIPP from various DOE defense TRU waste generator sites including Hanford Reservation Richland, WA, Idaho National Laboratory (INL) Idaho Falls, ID, Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) Los Alamos, NM, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) Oak Ridge, TN, Office of River Protection (ORP) Richland, WA, Savannah River Site (SRS) and other sites.  The effort includes the transport of contact-handled (CH) and remote-handled (RH) transuranic (TRU) waste in Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) certified Type B shipping packages.  The contract effort requires providing facilities, personnel, and equipment to provide a local terminal and transportation and maintenance services. Contractor-provided equipment will include tractors and necessary support equipment.

<SUBJECT>29--NOTICE OF INTENT TO EXTEND PERFORMANCE
<SOLNBR>DE-AC29-06AL66471
<RESPDATE>092006
<ARCHDATE>03202007
<CONTACT>Philip Murphy, Contracting Officer, 505-234-7465, Philip.Murphy@wipp.ws;Diane Snow, Contract Specialist, 505-234-7326, diane.snow@wipp.ws
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy, Carlsbad Field Office (CBFO), Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) program, intends to extend the period of performance of contract numbers DE-AC29-00AL66471 and DE-AC29-00AL66336 with CAST Specialty, Inc. (CAST) and Bed Rock, Inc. d/b/a Tri-State Motor Transit Company (TSMT) on a sole source bridge basis to provide uninterrupted support while the follow-on procurement numbered DE-RP30-06EW20001 is competed and awards are made. The extension will continue the performance period by one month and shall include 5 one-month option periods. The extended period of performance will be from October 27, 2006 through November 26, 2006 and if all five options are exercised the period of performance will extend through April 26, 2007. This extension is being made noncompetitively based on the exclusion found at Federal Acquisition Regulation, FAR 6.302 1 a, which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements within the required time-frame. To DOEâ€™s knowledge and belief, only CAST and TSMT have the requisite specialized equipment and highly specialized technical experience and training to ensure that the CBFOâ€™s requirements are met within the required delivery schedules. The strict contract requirements for drivers making transuranic (TRU) waste shipments to WIPP that are included in an agreement between the Secretary of Energy and the Southern States Energy Board (SSEB) and the Western Governorsâ€™ Association (WGA) result in it taking a long period of time for a contractor to hire drivers and complete an extensive training program (requiring 90 to 120 days) before a contractor can use new drivers to make WIPP shipments.  In addition, the contractsâ€™ tractor specifications are much more stringent than the industry standard requiring tractors being utilized under the contracts to be specially ordered thereby requiring at least several months for a contractor to procure or lease tractors that may be used to make WIPP shipments.  Due to the long period of time required for a new contractor to transition and initiate WIPP TRU waste shipments these services are available only from the existing contractors.  No other firms have the requisite equipment, training, experience and capability to assume the critical, highly specialized transportation support without causing an interruption in services. The present contracts with CAST and TSMT end on October 26, 2006; THERE ARE NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS AVAILABLE FOR THE EXTENSION OF THESE TWO CONTRACTS. Interested, responsible sources may submit information regarding their capability to perform this requirement, which shall be considered by the Department. Information received will be considered for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive acquisition. CAST and TSMT currently provide approximately 30 TRU waste shipments per week to WIPP from various DOE defense TRU waste generator sites including Hanford Reservation Richland, WA, Idaho National Laboratory (INL) Idaho Falls, ID, Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) Los Alamos, NM, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) Oak Ridge, TN, Office of River Protection (ORP) Richland, WA, Savannah River Site (SRS) and other sites.  The effort includes the transport of contact-handled (CH) and remote-handled (RH) transuranic (TRU) waste in Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) certified Type B shipping packages.  The contract effort requires providing facilities, personnel, and equipment to provide a local terminal and transportation and maintenance services. Contractor-provided equipment will include tractors and necessary support equipment.  The Contractor shall provide transportation services necessary to support WIPP, including: transportation of mixed and non-mixed CH- and RH-TRU waste, asbestos, and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contaminated TRU waste from generator sites to WIPP; transportation of CH- and RH-TRU waste between generator sites; transportation of training units or empty shipping containers to training/exercises, public awareness events; and, other equipment as designated by CBFO and maintenance. The Statement of Work for the requirement is provided on the Departmentâ€™s Industry Interactive Procurement System. Any responding party must provide a capability statement demonstrating its capability, as discussed above, which must include the following, as these items are necessary to demonstrate that the responding party is capable of performing the contemplated work without interruption: (1) a statement that proposed personnel (terminal manager, drivers, mechanics, safety, and support personnel) are currently employed by the responding party and will be available to perform the contemplated work; or a letter of commitment from personnel that the responding party intends to use to perform the contemplated work who are not currently employed by the responding party, demonstrating that they will be available to perform the contemplated work; (2) a chart or other synopsis of how the Contractâ€™s training requirements have been or will be met October 26, 2006; (3) a chart or other synopsis demonstrating that proposed personnel currently meet other minimum contract requirements; (4) a certification that the responding party possesses a local terminal or lease agreement continent upon the award suitable for dispatching and tractor and trailer maintenance; (5) documentation demonstrating the Offeror has a satisfactory U.S. Department of Transportation Motor Carrier rating; and (6) a discussion of the ability of the Offeror to successfully pass a Motor Carrier Evaluation Program (MCEP) Audit of all facets of a carrierâ€™s business operations including an extensive on site physical review of records and equipment.

<DESC>SOLE SOURCE NOTICE: The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source (Raytheon Solipsys) under the authority of FAR 13.106.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within 5 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally by considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Sole Source is based upon this vendor being the only vendor able to provide follow-on acquisition of a system already developed specifically for the NORAD-NORTHCOM mission needs.  Procuring from a different source would mean additional development and integration costs, as well as an unacceptable time delay. 

6EA Sotware and licenses for Solipsys Products 0102001(Use License), 0402001(Upgrades), 0502001 (Support).  

1Ea Installation and Training as stated in Statement of Work (SOW)

SOW
1.	Goal:
To install multiple TDF displays at Peterson AFB showing the NCS track picture, similar to the current presentation to CMOC.
2.	Tasks
In the current Design, it seems necessary to:
1.	Introduce a new data tap off of the existing replicator at Tyndall
2.	Configure a new cryptographically secure high-bandwidth connection from Tyndall to Peterson
3.	Introduce a new IP replicator in the network room at Peterson
4.	Install and configure a IP switch for this new display network
5.	Install and configure new workstations (blade enclosure)
6.	Install remote KVM workstation 'heads'
7.	Install TDF (NCS Edition) on those workstations
8.	Train personnel in the operations and maintenance of this new equipment.
3.	Statement of Work
3.1	Tap data from existing replicator
Solipsys engineers have already assisted SEADS/CONR CM personnel in configuring a new data feed off of the existing replicator.  An unused network interface will be put into service on both the primary and backup machines, and a new route will be added to support the downstream data path once the hardware is installed at Peterson AFB.
3.2	Configure connection to Peterson
The customer will provide the network connectivity, cryptographic equipment, appropriate infrastructure (racks, power, cooling, etc..), network addresses, and qualified technicians to configure this secure connection.  Solipsys will be provided with the ‘Red’ side network addresses.
3.3	IP Replicator at Peterson
The customer will provide the hardware and infrastructure for a PC with at least 2 network interfaces and appropriate memory and CPU as described in the Engineering notes.  Solipsys requires that the machine run Windows 2000, Windows XP, Solaris 8, Solaris 10, or Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 or newer.  Solipsys will provide software installation support and customization.
3.4	IP Switch
The customer will provide the hardware and infrastructure for an IP switched network capable of supporting the required number of workstations, servers, and allowing for 50% system growth.  Solipsys will provide support in configuring this network as appropriate for a TDF display network.
3.5	Blade workstations
The customer will provide hardware and infrastructure for 12 workstations with 2GB RAM, 3.5GHz Pentium 4 CPU, 80GB physical storage, and accelerated graphics (or better).  These machines should run Windows XP.  The customer will provide access to personnel to allow for customized configuration of these machines to include such elements as removing firewall and virus scan processes as well as network customizations.
3.6	KVM Heads
The customer will provide hardware and infrastructure for the displays for these machines.
3.7	Install TDF
Solipsys will provide support for installation and configuration of TDF, NCS Edition on the workstations.  The software version will match that which is installed at the NORAD Air Defense Sectors.
3.8	Training	
An informal class to include the same topics as the formal class, but presented as On the Job Training, where the installation engineer will pass on knowledge and run small sessions at the workstations, rather than in a formal classroom environment with prepared syllabus, goals, and evaluations.

3.9	Travel	
Two engineers will travel to the customer site to install software and connect required interfaces.  Once the system is operational then they will provide user and maintainer training.

<DESC>Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation’s most talented architects, landscape architects, interior designers, and engineers to design federal buildings of outstanding quality and value.  These projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, reliability, and reduced energy consumption; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and give contemporary form and meaning to our democratic values.

In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements including the P100 (Facilities Standards for the Public Buildings Service) and the U.S. Land Port of Entry Design Guide.  As required by law, all facilities will meet federal energy goals, including the new standards mandated by EPACT 2005, security requirements, and the Architecture Barriers Act Accessibility Standards.  The facility will be designed in metric units.  The project will be LEED certified. 

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The site is located approximately 65 miles south of Tucson, Arizona.  The site is remote and has a harsh climate.  Access to the Mariposa Port of Entry is provided by Arizona State Road 189 from the north and Mexican Federal Highway 15 from the south.  Since its construction in 1973, this Port has experienced dramatic growth in traffic volumes.   Today it is one of the ten busiest cargo ports along the entire U.S. – Mexico border.  There have been increases in all modes of traffic.  Population growth, increased law enforcement activities, national security requirements, changes in trade policies, and outdated facilities and technology have render this Port in need of expansion, upgrade, and repair.
The goal of this project is to expand and modernize the existing facilities into a state-of-the-art full-service port of entry.  The work will include demolition, renovation, and new construction.  The project will include the Main Building, primary Privately Owned Vehicle (POV) inspection booths, secondary POV inspection booths, pedestrian primary and secondary inspection area, bus inspection area, head house, screened impound inspection area, hazardous materials dock, hazardous materials drive-in pit, pre-primary commercial building,  primary commercial inspection booths, commercial building, commercial docks, X-ray and VACIS locations, seized property vault, kennel, generator backup, outbound facility, export dock, and associated roadwork to facilitate the renovated site.
The Port will remain active during the renovation work.  The phasing of work must not interfere with the port operation.  Temporary facilities shall be incorporated into the design and construction to maintain Port security and operations during construction.
The final design should make a distinct architectural statement that is responsive to the efficient movement of trade and commerce, the security requirements of law enforcement agencies, the new standards mandated by EPACT 2005, and the welcoming of visitors and citizens to the United States of America. 
A traditional design-bid-build, fixed price contract is expected. 

SCOPE OF WORK
The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: Professional architecture services,  landscape architecture services, engineering, traffic engineering, interior design, and related consulting services for concept design documents, design development documents, metric construction documents, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, computer-aided design (CAD), building information modeling (BIM—for all projects receiving design funding in FY07 and beyond, GSA requires spatial program building information models as a minimum requirement for submissions to the Office of the Chief Architect for final concept approvals by the PBS Commissioner; GSA supports the use in all projects of mature 3D-4D-BIM technologies—spatial program validation and beyond—at strategic project phases in support of specific project challenges) and post-construction contract services (PCCS).  The project is also to include GSA design standards for secure facilities; conformance to the P100 (Facility Standards for the Public Buildings Service), including Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification; EPACT 2005 compliance; customer agency requirements, including the U.S. Land Port of Entry Design Guide.  All facilities, existing and new, incorporated in the design, shall conform to the latest building codes, including but not limited to the most current seismic standards, security requirements, utility systems, fire safety, and the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standard (ABAAS).

The party of participants is comprised of CBP employees, Contractors, and/or representatives from foreign governments, all working on official US Government business.

High quality facilities and relating services are required for this event. Contractor facilities that currently have 3 Star/3 Diamond ratings or higher (for 5 increment rating systems) from organizations such as AAA, OAG, Travelocity, Orbitz, etc. are desired. See statement of work and the evaluation of quotations section of the solicitation document for details.

This is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services. An offer/quotation that requires the Government to execute a separate agreement with a third party hotel shall be deemed technically unacceptable.

CBP is a federal government agency and as such is exempt from most sales and occupancy taxes for goods and services it acquires directly, via purchase order as in this case. A NY State tax exemption form (ST-129) will be completed and submitted to the successful Contractor after award. 

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested via the relating solicitation that has been uploaded at this website, RFQ HSBP1006Q0859. This is an RFQ in accordance with FAR Part 13. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-12 AUG 2006) and the Department of Homeland Security Acquisition Regulations (HSAR). It is the responsibility of the vendor to be familiar with the applicable clauses and provisions. This RFQ will be issued exclusively through this Government Point of Entry (www.fbo.gov). All future information about this acquisition including amendments to this procurement requirement will also be distributed through this site. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition.

The Government intends to award a purchase order resulting from this RFQ to the responsible vendor whose quotation conforming to the RFQ will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. Responses will be evaluated on the basis of best value. Evaluation Factors are Technical Acceptability (required accommodations, services etc.) Past Performance and Price. Technical Acceptability is more important than Past Performance. Both Technical Acceptability and Past Performance are more important than Price. While Technical Acceptability is the most important criteria, CBP still desires to acquire the accomodation services at rates near the current GSA perdiem level ($162.00 for Nassau County).

NOTE: Offerors/Quoters must be registered at   WWW.CCR.GOV in order to be eligible for award and must be in compliance with the Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act of 1990 (PL101-391).

<DESC>1.0  The Space & Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) intends to post a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) in September 2006 to solicit white papers on various engineering studies for the Advanced Communications Package (ACP) Program.  The BAA will specify the engineering study topics on which white papers will be sought. ACP is a communications payload for MQ-8B Firescout Vertical Take off and Landing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (VTUAV) that will extend the range of off- board sensors from the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS).  ACP will be integrated and operated with the VTUAV. ACP will provide a non-Satellite Communication (SATCOM) Over-the-Horizon (OTH) data relay capability between the LCS and its remote sensors, thus allowing the LCS to develop and maintain an OTH tactical picture of the battlespace using organic sensors.  These sensors will include unmanned vehicles and deployable sensors.  ACP will simultaneously relay control signals and data via TCDL and L-Band data links between the LCS and its sensors. 2.0 SYNPOSIS TERMS - THIS IS AN ADVANCED NOTICE SYNOPSIS ONLY.

<DESC>Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) Norfolk Detachment Philadelphia intends to procure services required to provide engineering support to the United States Joint Forces Command (US JFCOM) , Suffolk, VA for the specialized development, administration, and maintenance of an existing Definity G3r R11 telephone switch with INTUITY Audix voice mail and an Emerald call accounting system.   This requirement will be solicited as a 100% Small Business Set-Aside.  The mission of JFCOM is to provide a training environment where Joint Task Force Commanders can learn to develop and implement joint force doctrine, tactics, and procedures in a realistic facility, using computer-simulated scenarios instead of actual troop deployment.   JFCOM supports Mission Integration and Rehearsals for assigned forces, where tactics and procedures are developed and practiced in the event of a real-world crisis.   These military exercises require expedient and ongoing reconfiguration and reprogramming of the Definity system to adapt to building populations that can vary from less than 1,000 to nearly 3,000 in a matter of days.   During an exercise, telephone system reconfiguration takes place on a continuous, often minute-to-minute basis, as mandated by conditions of the exercise and orders from the Joint Task Force Commander.   The system includes the secure transmission of voice, video, and data, and must interface with a variety of analog and digital commercial, strategic, and tactical telecommunications systems, video teleconferencing circuits, and foreign systems and circuits belonging to allied nations.   Interfaces of the JFCOM Definity system with modeling and simulation systems must be reengineered as the model/simulation evolves.   Similar engineering is required to interface the Definity system with  telecommunications systems of allied countries such as the Partnership for Peace Simulation Network (PFPSN) to distribute voice communications to U. S. and European sites using Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP), Voice Over Frame Relay (VOFR), or Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM).   The JFCOM Definity system undergoes continuous reengineering to meet new mission requirements.   This includes redesign of the JFCOM cable plant , dial plan, and system software in support of new lab spaces and existing test bays.   The system is a unique state-of-the-art telecommunications architecture, unlike any currently existing in the Department of Defense.   The requirement is for twelve months of services, commencing 1 October 2006, with three (3) twelve-month option periods.   The award of a firm fixed price purchase order is anticipated.   Quoters shall be required to submit price and past performance information.  Regarding past performance, quoters shall describe its past performance on similar contracts or orders it has held within the last five (5) years which are of similar scope, magnitude and complexity to that which is detailed in the Request For Quote (RFQ), or affirmatively state that it possess no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  The RFQ contains more instruction regarding instruction of past performance submission.  A formal copy of the Request For Quote (RFQ) Number N00140-06-Q-3422 is available at the website www.neco.navy.mil.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and small business size standard are 811213 and $6.5M, respectively.   All responsible sources may submit a quote that shall be considered by FISC Norfolk Detachment Philadelphia.  The actual closing date/time for the receipt of quotes has been established in the solicitation.   Quoters shall be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to be considered for award.   See www.ccr.gov for further information and instructions.   For questions regarding this announcement, please contact Mr. John D. Favata, Code 270.2E at john.favata@navy.mil or (215) 697-9632.

Call 1-888-227-2423 or visit the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov/ for more information.  This announcement is published as a Total Small Business Set-Aside action per FAR 52.219-1 and 52.219-6 (this means you must be a small business, quoting the product of a small-business manufacturer); all eligible, responsible sources may submit an offer.  This is a combined synopsis / solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR 13 and the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  Solicitation number / RFQ N00244-06-R-0057 applies; an electronic copy of the RFQ can be accessed at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-12 (8/4/06) and DFAR Change Notices effective through 8/8/06.  The standard industrial code is 1711 (NAICS 238220) and the business size standard is $13million.   The agency need is for a contract to provide boiler feedwater services to Naval ships in the San Diego Metro area bases.  The contract will be for a base year and four one-year options.  The statement of work is as follows:  Boiler Feedwater Services 1.1	Each delivery of boiler feedwater shall be accompanied by a water quality certification showing that the water meets the requirements listed below (refer to NSTM S9086-GX-STM-020/CH-220 V2 paragraph 220-22.18 through 220-22.22).  Constituent or Property Hardness—0.10 EPM max; Conductivity -<2.5 micro mho/CM* hardness. * NSTM S9086-GX-STM020/CH-220 V2 paragraph 220-22.24 states, “The maximum permissible demineralized makeup feedback conductivity is 1.0 micro mho/cm.  If the demineralized makeup feedwater conductivity exceeds this limit, the resin is expended.” 1.2	To ensure the feedwater, which is processed from shore water and provided to ships, meets the above standards, the Contractor shall continuously monitor the conductivity of the feedwater being provided and shall test the feedwater for silica before delivery to each ship.  When any test result indicates that the effluent does not meet the above standards, the Contractor shall test the water in all the ship’s feed tanks which received water.  The Contractor shall provide copies of all test results to the ship receiving the water. 1.3	pH will be measured with an in-line-mounted probe on the discharge side of the mobile demineralized by other products. 1.4	Hardness and alkalinity will be monitored by the Receiving Activity.  1.5	Shipside testing is to be completed on silica with the use of the Hach Low Level Silica Test Kit and on resistivity with a Blasbaugh Resistivity Monitor (use polyethylene bottles and avoid using a glass container which can give a false high silica result).  The test and certification is to be performed on site through the use of this equipment provided by the Contractor. 1.6	The exact amount of processed water going to the customer will be calculated via an inline Flow meter mounted on the discharge side of the mobile demineralized.  After completion of delivery of demineralized water to customer the Contractor shall not proceed to disconnect equipment until a ship’s force personnel has recorded the exact amount of product delivered by the Contractor.  The point of contact on the ship will be the Ship’s Oil King or the Main Propulsion Assistant (MPA). 2.0	Water Quality Certification 2.1	The Contractor will be required to furnish certification that each delivery meets the requirements listed in paragraph 1.1. 2.2	Certification shall be provided to the Engineering Officer of the receiving ship at the time delivery is made. 2.3	The Navy has the right to conduct independent testing to confirm that the water delivered is within specifications.  The Government will not make payment for any deliveries found not to meet specifications. 2.4	Inspection and acceptance of feedwater to be furnished shall be made at destination by the receiving activity.  Questions shall be handled by the Ordering Officer. 2.5	At the request of Southwest Regional Maintenance Center (SWRMC), a demineralized unit delivered to a ship can be retained at the delivery point by the Government when a complaint is received by SWRMC from the ship that the quality of water does not meet contract specifications.  Once retained by the Government, neither the Contractor nor the Government can operate the unit.  The unit will be tested for water quality within 24 hours and returned to the Contractor.  A representative from the ship alleging the poor water quality and the Contractor will observe operation of the unit and witness quality test performed by the Government and/or a separate water quality test performed by the Contractor. 2.6	Contractor/Facility shall continuously monitor the Contractor’s Demineralizer IAW NSTM 220-22.21 (Conductivity Cell). 2.7	Shore processed feedwater (demineralizers) or any other process other than steam condensation shall meet the requirements NSTM 220.22.20. 2.8	The Contractor shall provide the ship’s force point of contact, Ship’s Oil King or the Main Propulsion Assistant (MPA) with the most recent Pierside mobile demineralizers efficient meter readings prior to delivery. 2.9	The Contractor shall provide the ship’s force with the most recent Pierside mobile demineralizer mixed bed ion exchange resin change out date, efficient meter readings, and the projected date of the following resin change out. 2.10	The Contractor supplying the feedwater shall certify that a sample of the feedwater meets the requirements set forth in paragraph 2220-22.20.  Prior to supplying water to the ship’s feed system, Pierside demineralizers shall be flushed to the waste and flowing effluent shall be tested and certified by the Contractor as meeting the standards of paragraph 2220-22.20.  The requirement applies anytime Pierside demineralizers are secured and restarted regardless of the lead-time.  A manifold system shall be used such that the ship’s continuous flowing pierside demineralizer effluent can be directed to waste or ship’s feed system without interrupting the flow through the demineralizer.  A 100 mesh “Y”-type strainer shall be installed in the feed line to the ship to preclude resin contamination in the ship system. 2.11	To ensure that feedwater, which is processed from shore water and provided to ships, met the required standards, the Contractor shall test the feedwater for silica before delivery to each ship in accordance with NSTM 2220-22.20. 3.0	Contractor Facility and Experience 3.1	The Contractor will be required to regenerate, maintain, and repair mobile demineralizers. 3.2	The Contractor will be required to have facilities accept oral orders 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  Mobile communication equipment shall be maintained in all delivery trucks. 4.0	Mobile Demineralization Specifications shall be as follows: 4.1	Exchange capacity shall be 750,000-1,000,000 grains for each mobile demineralizer and be regenerated after they have delivered 70% of their rated capacity. 4.2	The equipment furnished shall incorporate all features necessary for satisfactory operation in a sea and air environment. 4.3	The demineralizer shall consist of carbon steel, rubber lined (or equivalent) demineralizer trains containing at least one cation unit, one anion unit, and two parallel FRP mix bed units with interconnecting piping valves and accessories not specifically identified herein but required for an operable system.  The Contractor shall be required to supply industry standard “small” or “medium” demineralizers which are to be approximately 12’ H  x  8’  W  x  16’ L.  4.4	Each mobile demineralizer shall be equipped with a batch meter device that shall automatically shut off the inlet valve when a pre-set number of gallons have been delivered.  This device shall be of a design that cannot be reset by ship’s company, only by the Contractor. 4.5	Each mobile demineralizer shall be equipped with a resistivity monitor.  The delivery of feedwater shall be automatically terminated if the water exceeds specifications.  The resistivity monitor and cell shall be calibrated at least quarterly. 4.6	Each mobile demineralizer shall be equipped with a fully automatic rinse control panel.  Unit  shall have a light to indicate control panel is on (and if not on, there is no power to the unit), a light indicating poor water quality and a 10 minute flushing cycle before being manually reset, and a light shall also indicate good water quality.  The Contractor is responsible for flushing all units at a maximum of 24 hours prior to arrival at the pier.  Contractor shall therefore pre-flush the equipment at their facility prior to any delivery. 4.7	No mobile demineralizer shall be delivered and set-up for a ship without a theoretically calculated number of gallons remaining in that mobile demineralizer.  Under normal circumstances, the mobile demineralizer shall shut down on the gallons delivered, not on exceeding resistivity limits. 4.8	Mobile demineralizers are to be placarded with detailed operating instructions including flushing procedures; and if necessary, instructions shall be displayed for recovery after there has been an interruption in delivery. 4.9	Raw water inlet and boiler feedwater outlet fittings shall be furnished by the Contractor and be compatible with Navy 1 ½” fire hose fittings. 4.10	Each mobile demineralizer shall be equipped with a sample valve on the outlet for the purpose of taking water samples while equipment is operating. 4.11	Each mobile demineralizer shall be equipped with automatic air venting valves and inlet and outlet pressure gauges. 4.12	Each mobile demineralizer shall not exceed 12 feet (H) X 8 feet (W) X 16 feet (L) and a weight of 10,000 pounds. 4.13	The Contractor is required to use 120 degree Fahrenheit hot caustic injection, since silica loading of resin and break-through into the boiler feedwater is of great concern. 4.14	A “Y”-type strainer with ICU mesh filter in feed line is required. 4.15	Unit price shall include removal of all equipment after completion of deliveries. 5.0	Government Supplied Equipment 5.1	The Government will supply raw water at a minimum pressure of 40 PSI and at an estimated flow rate between 30 to 60 gallons per minute.  Due to variable demand at any pier for raw water, supply pressures could exceed 70 PSI or higher.  The Contractor shall be required to protect its own and any Government equipment from damage due to maximum pressure fluctuations by installing necessary regulating systems. 5.2	The Government will supply 120 volt, single phase, 60-hertz electrical power with a 3 prong female connector. 5.3	The Government will supply hoses from the pier water source to the mobile demineralizer and to the delivery point aboard ship.  In any instance where the Contractor notices a leak in the ship’s hoses or fittings, the Contractor shall notify the COR of the leak so that the ship can take corrective action to fix either the hose or fitting. 5.4	The Contractor is authorized to locate demineralizers on the pier in close proximity to the customer ships and shall be clear of fire lanes and parallel to the edge of the pier facing in the direction of the shore to allow for emergency evacuation if necessary. The maximum amount of time a demineralizer shall be allowed to remain on the pier is for one 24 hour period immediately after usage disconnect.  Vehicles physically attached to the ship via a hose may be parked unattended for their essential use only. 5.5	It is the Contractor’s responsibility to adhere to Navy parking regulations and the SOW requirements.  If the 24 hour period is exceeded, the Navy will exercise its authority to issue a summons and / or remove any equipment found to be in violation of Navy parking regulations at the Contractor’s expense.  Damages to the Contractor’s equipment will not be covered by the Contracts Dispute Act as they are not related to the contract.  If the Contractor is “parking” his equipment, he is liable like any other “driver” who violates on-base Navy parking regulations.  Currently, there is no established parking or staging area for equipment beyond its service to the ship. 6.0	Water Containment 6.1	To avoid unnecessary traffic on piers, water delivered under this contract will be produced by a mobile demineralizer as described below and stationed alongside the receiving ship, versus use of a bulk water tank truck. 6.2	Contractor shall provide containment around the demineralizer unit sufficient to contain water that leaks from the unit.  The term “unit” does not include hoses provided by the Navy.  Water that accumulates in the containment must be properly disposed.  Water that does leak from Navy connections or hoses and is captured by the secondary containment is the disposal responsibility of the Contractor.  Proper disposal includes, but is not limited to pumping to the BOWTS, CHT, or hauling off site.  The accumulated water may not be discharged directly into the San Diego Bay or onto the pier. 6.3	The exact amount of processed water going to the customer shall be calculated by means of an inline Flow meter mounted on the discharge side of the mobile demineralizer.  After completion of delivery of demineralized water to the customer, the Contractor shall not proceed to disconnect the equipment until a ship’s force personnel has recorded the exact amount of product delivered by the Contractor on attachment. 6.4	The Contractor is responsible for ensuring that his equipment is in good working order and does not leak.  The Contractor is responsible for providing a point of contact that shall be available at any time their equipment is on the pier.  The Contractor is responsible for repairing all leaks within 24 hours of being reported by any Navy personnel.  There shall be no additional charge for this repair. 6.5	As mentioned in 6.2, demineralizers shall not discharge any residual water to adjacent drains, San Diego Bay, or the pier.  Any discharge is considered an illicit discharge under Navy’s Storm Water Permits.  The Contractor shall adjust his dumping operations accordingly.  As a result, the Contractor is required to comply with all applicable Federal, State, and Local Environmental as well as Regulatory Laws including, but not limited to the following: Assimilative Crimes Act (18 USC 13), Federal Adoption of State Law (California Penal Code/Health and Safety Code 25789.5, Unauthorized Disposal of Hazardous Waste, Section 301 of the Clean Water Act, California Porter Cologne Water Quality Control Act, State Water Resources Control Board Water Quality Order No. 97-03.DWQ General Permit No. CAS000001 and Water Quality Control Plan for San Diego Basin (9).  Any instance of noncompliance by the Contractor shall require a report of this discharge to the Water Quality Control Boa!  rd.   6.6	The Contractor is prohibited from discharging wastes (including waste water) into the “Waters of the United States” or a conveyance system that discharges to “Waters of the United States” unless the discharge is specifically authorized or exempted by a National Pollutant Elimination System permit or by applicable regulations.  In addition, no such discharge is permitted without written authorization from the Commander Navy Region Southwest, Environmental Department. 7.0	Ordering / COR Information 7.1	Ships are not authorized to contact the Contractor directly.  Naval Base San Diego (NBSD) Port Operations is the ordering activity and is authorized to deal with the Contractor if and when problems arise.  Weekend or after work hours delivery will not be authorized without ISIC concurrence and the Port Ops Program Manager’s (PM) approval.  A normal rainmaker requirement can be made 0800-1600, Monday through Friday.  Rainmaker requirements for emergencies or urgent operations cannot be ordered outside of 0800-1600, Monday through Friday without ISIC approval and / or Port Ops PM approval.  Orders shall be placed with the Contractor orally by the Port Ops Ordering Officer/ Fleet Support Supervisor.    7.2	The procedure for Contractor submittal of invoices is as follows: The Contractor shall bill per every 20 orders.  A spreadsheet will be required and will include ship, requisition number, call number and CLIN, quantity, unit price, and spreadsheet amounts totaled.  The Contractor shall submit this spreadsheet along with the invoice to NBSD Port Operations. 8.0	Contract Payment 8.1	Payment shall be by Government Credit Card.

<SUBJECT>A -- Type 1 Diabetes Mouse Resource
<SOLNBR>NIH-NIDDK-06-04
<RESPDATE>070706
<CONTACT>Dana Harris, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-594-9987, Fax 301-480-4226, Email harrisd@extra.niddk.nih.gov - Dana Harris, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-594-9987, Fax 301-480-4226, Email harrisd@extra.niddk.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) to conduct a second phase of repository activity for animal models of Type 1 Diabetes and its complications. 

Jackson Labs is the one responsible source that can satisfy the Agency’s requirement because (1) Jackson Labs houses and maintains the archives of critical previously collected animal strains and data, (2) has extensive experience necessary to conduct activities proposed for the current contract; and (3) no other source can supply the services that will satisfy agency requirements for the follow-on work for this effort. 

Development of the original repository, the Type 1 Diabetes Repository at Jackson Labs (T1DR; http://www.jax.org/t1dr/index.html) was initiated in 2001 and supported by NIDDK through a supplement to an existing NCRR resource, the Induced Mutant Repository (IMR). Strain importation and associated studies and data collection were begun in 2001. To date, the T1DR has imported and archived nearly 150 strains important for diabetes research, and distributed over 500 mice to 100 independent investigators.  In addition, disease incidence studies have been performed on nearly 20 of the imported recombinant strains within the context of Jackson Labs vivarium conditions. This ability to measure the impact of genetic changes on Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) within the context of the common and consistent environment provided within the Jackson Labs vivarium was a necessary and critical component of T1DR research activity in the prior project phase that must be maintained to provide consistency of results in Phase II. Finally, the ability of Jackson Laboratories to distribute T1DR-archived strains to investigators in most cases without the need for additional quarantine procedures beyond what is required for receipt of commercially available JAX strains is necessary to expedite and maximize the efficiency of research.   

For cost and efficiency purposes, NIDDK plans to continue the second phase of the T1DR using a single contractor (Jackson Laboratories). The contractor will continue activities to help identify mouse strains of unique value to T1D research, will import and archive these strains, will verify disease incidence and severity in a subset of the imported strains under controlled housing conditions, and will facilitate limited distribution of mice to the scientific community. In addition, the contractor will provide strain development support services for the NIDDK-funded Animal Models of Diabetic Complications Consortium. This activity will require production, housing, phenotyping, archiving, and distribution of mouse strains important for advancing research in diabetic complications. 

Pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 6.302-1, The Jackson Laboratories is the only source capable of performing this requirement due to their unique vivarium conditions and distribution capabilities, and prerequisite knowledge, experience and existing data generated through work performed under the prior supplement provided by NIDDK to the NCRR Induced Mutant Resource grant.

To begin anew with a different source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the government that would not be recovered through competition, as well as unacceptable delays and loss of consistency in data describing disease incidence and severity.

Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements as described above. A determination not to compete the proposed work based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. This notice of intent is not an announcement of the availability of a Request for Proposal, nor is an RFP available.  See Numbered Note 22.

<SUBJECT>L -- DESIGN AND CONDUCT A STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESS
<SOLNBR>NIH-NIDDK-06-967
<RESPDATE>091106
<ARCHDATE>09262006
<CONTACT>V. Lynn Griffin, Purchasing Agent, Phone 301-594-7730, Fax 301-480-8501, Email griffinv@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>The Fogarty International Center (FIC) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to procure the services from Robert J. Berendt Associates to facilitate FIC’s strategic planning process.  FIC needs an individual with significant NIH strategic planning experience as well as similar experience with large health organizations that serve a diverse set of needs in health research and health care delivery.  FIC is a Center with a broad and interdisciplinary approach to global health.  A contractor who is expert in working with such broad, interdisciplinary health organizations is required.  A contractor whose expertise includes work with organizations comprised of one or more significant global health components is desired.  The contractor needs to be intimately familiar with the mission of various NIH Institutes/Centers and how the strategic planning process sharpens the focus of these various visions into one policy-forming mission for the Institute/Center as a whole. The contractor must have previous experience and skill, not only in working with, but in advising directors and senior scientific staff in order to focus the strategic planning process.  Furthermore, FIC requires a contactor who has experience and skill in facilitating stakeholder conferences and advisory board meetings with senior members of various scientific communities, as FIC's strategic planning process includes garnering output from a broad array of external and international stakeholders and scientists.  Ideally, the contractor will have had prior experience with the NIEHS, as FIC plans to emulate its strategic planning process and as FIC and NIEHS's collaborative relationship continues to grow closer.  Given that the FIC strategic planning process is on a fast-track, this individual ideally should be willing and able to adapt a successful model for strategic planning that he/she has implemented at one or more Institutes or Centers at the NIH, which have a significant global health research component and a multi-disciplinary research focus.  Robert J. Berendt Associates recently planned, advised, and facilitated the strategic planning process for the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), which has a significant interest and portfolio in international environmental health research. The process included a web comment period and internal and external stakeholder meetings, and culminated in the publication of NIEHS 2006-2011 Strategic Plan: New Frontiers in Environmental Sciences and Human Health.  Mr. Berendt also planned, advised, and facilitated strategic planning process for the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR), which involved multi-disciplinary representation from the clinical and basic research communities and culminated in the publication of NCRR: A Catalyst for Discovery.  In addition, Mr. Berendt designed and facilitated a comprehensive strategic planning initiative addressing critical issues in education, clinical and basic research, delivery of patient services, and advancement, public affairs, and outreach at major academic medical centers, such as Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta, GA.  In fact, FIC will employ a similar strategic planning process that was used by NIEHS.  Mr. Berendt's recent experience with two NIH Institutes/Centers and other large healthcare/research organizations, his expertise in advising senior scientific staff through the strategic planning process, his ability to quickly and easily employ an effective strategic planning methodology, his design and implementation of web-comment periods, and his previous experience and skill in planning and facilitating meetings for strategic planning purposes gives him considerable expertise that will satisfy FIC's needs and justifies a lack of competition.  To the best of the Government’s knowledge, no other contractor has the level of experience and skills required to perform the services required by the FIC.  

Specifically, Mr. Berendt will work with FIC senior leadership to design a strategic planning process that is based on proven planning models at NIH.  In addition, he will guide the development of the internationally and scientifically-focused questions for the web-based comment period and work with FIC staff to analyze the results of the web comment period; provide advice on appropriate stakeholder participation; he will draft strategic documents highlighting the specific components and methodology needed to implement the strategic planning process, including advance materials, analyses and summary information for Staff Retreats, Advisory Board Meetings, Small Working Group Meetings, and Stakeholder Conferences; and facilitate these meetings.  It would not be cost-effective for a new vendor to be contracted. Though other contractors could feasibly learn the strategic planning methodology that Bob Berendt has previously implemented, this process would take considerable additional time and therefore cost FIC a substantial amount of additional funding.  During this period of flat budgets, contracting with such a vendor may preclude FIC from effectively completing its strategic planning goals. This is set aside for small businesses. Small businesses may identify in writing their interest with a capability statement to the Contracting Office prior to the closing date of this notice. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all responses received, before the closing date of this announcement, will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition is based upon responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<SUBJECT>L -- ANALYSIS OF NIH DIT TOOLKIT
<SOLNBR>NIH-NIDDK-06-993

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) has a requirement to purchase the services of the Research Systems Inc., 4990 Pearl E Circle, Boulder, CO 80301 to perform analysis of NIH DIT Toolkit.  Several NIH Institutes have jointly sponsored a large multicenter study of normal brain development in children.  The goal of this study is to learn more about how the brain develops in typical, healthy children and adolescents.  This study will enroll approximately 500 children, ranging from infancy to young adulthood, who will be seen at different time points over a six-year period.  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain will be performed and the imaging findings will be related to the results of standardized neuropsychological tests.  A Diffusion Tensor MRI processing Center (DPC) was established in the Section on Tissue Biophysics and Biomimetics (STBB), LIMB, NICHD to process and analyze diffusion tensor MRI (DT-MRI) data that will be acquired by the various Centers during the course of the study.  We have developed software to accomplish these tasks.  Our software, which we will refer to as the NIH DTI toolkit, is primarily written in IDL, although it performs external calls to procedures written in C, and Java.  The program also calls other executables routines, such as the BET procedure developed by the FSL group in Oxford, UK.  The NIH DTI toolkit receives as input Diffusion Weighted Images (DWIs) in DICOM format and produces as output Diffusion Diffusion Tensor derived quantities in Analyze format.  The diffusion tensor MRI data processing pipeline consists of these main steps: 1) Importing raw data and sorting correctly the b-matrices; 2) Performing motion and eddy-current distortion correction; 3) Registering raw images to a template; 4) Producing new b-matrices taking into account eventual rotation of coordinate system; 5) Producing “corrected” raw images re-samples at an arbitrary resolution; 6) Computing the diffusion tensor via multivariate non-linear regression with robust estimation; 7) Computing tensor derived variables such as Trace(D), Fractional Anisotropy, Directionally encoded Color Maps, etc..  One important next step of our work is to release our NIH DIT toolkit to the scientific community enabling investigators outside our group to process their own data in accordance with our data processing protocols.  In order to achieve this goal we need to accomplish the following tasks:  1) Streamline the current code by removing spurious procedures that are not relevant to the functionality of the program; 2) Optimize procedures for improved performance; 3) Add comments to the code.  To the best of the Governments knowledge the proposed contractor is the only known source that can provide the services as described above.  Interested vendors may identify in writing their interest with a capability statement to the Contracting Office prior to the closing date of this notice.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, however, all responses received, before the closing date of this announcement, will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition is based upon responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal.  A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.

National Institute on Drug Abuse, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition, Office of Acquisitions- Neurosciences, on behalf of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a non-competitive basis to Constantine Yiannoutsos, PhD., 11295 Brentwood Avenue, Zionville, IN 46077 to provide continued research regarding efforts for a study entitled,  HIV INFECTION ON HUMAN BRAIN 08-06,  the study of patients that have died of HIV, and for whom comprehensive neuromedical and neuropsychiatric data were gathered antemortem.

 The National NeuroAIDS Tissue Consortium TC), supported by NIMH Center for Mental Health Research on AIDS (CMHRA) and NINDS funding, was established in 1998 to collect, store, and distribute samples of nervous tissue, cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and other tissue from HIV-infected individuals. The NIMH and NNTC mission is to foster research on the effects of HIV infection on human brain by providing high-quality well ¬characterized tissue samples from patients who died with HIV, and for whom comprehensive neuromedical and neuropsychiatric data were gathered antemortem. Researchers can request tissues from patients who have been characterized by: degree of neurobehavioral impairment, neurological and other clinical diagnoses, history of drug use, antiretroviral treatments, blood and CSF viral load, neuropath logical diagnosis. The resource was established in 1998, shortly after HAART treatment became available in developed countries. Patients being enrolled into the NNTC and organ donation program were thought to be end stage patients at the time of their enrollment. Due to the success of HAART in managing HIV disease progression, enrolled volunteers have survived much longer than expected and NNTC has become an unanticipated extremely valuable cohort. The NNTC coordinating center has been collecting biannual data on approximately 1800 subjects. The database was not originally designed to answer epidemiological questions as the primary goal of the NNTC was to enroll late-stage patients and be a bank for brains and fluids. The NNTC now needs to acquire statistical expertise in order to determine how to best move forward in terms of assessing the value of the repository in terms of database-derived analysis and associated basic research projects, modifying current database practices, and making recommendations regarding potential changes in clinical protocols or patient targeted demographics to optimize the scientific value of the resource.

The contractor will provide the following service.

	

. Serve as an external advisor to the National NeuroAIDS

 Tissue Consortium

. Participate in monthly one-hour Steering Committee conference calls.

. Provide advice on the implementation of standardized protocols for clinical, neurological, neuropathological and neuropsychological assessment and tissue collection for the consortium, particularly as relates to statistical considerations.
. Provide suggestions regarding the central database operations and its role as a conduit between the NNTC principal investigators and the public; facilitate the identification of data demographics and key descriptive statistics for the public website.

. Provide expert opinion regarding the scientific strengths and limitations of the NNTC database in terms of genetic epidemiology research and other type research projects; help identify research areas of promise based upon the database capabilities.

. Participate in annual External Advisory Committee meetings, Steering Committee Meetings, or Scientific Agenda priority meetings when scheduled.

. Recommend to the NNTC Steering Committee analyses that could be performed on the
existing NNTC core data elements.
	
 Discuss requests for analyses from NNTC Steering Committee members. Provide advice to the NIMH, NNTC Steering Committee and NCD statistical and data.

management staff regarding analyses approved by the NNTC Steering Committee and in the preparation of reports detailing the outcomes of approved analysis.

Assist in evaluating the feasibility of adding additional core data elements considering
Their scientific value, consistency in definition, and completeness across sites.
 Attend annual face-to-face NNTC meetings in Maryland.

Period of Performance:  September 2006 – June 2007

Deliverables

The goal of the NIMH contract is to (1) determine the value of the repository in terms of database-derived analysis and associated basic research projects (2) identify database associated practices that would optimize its scientific value (3) identify appropriate protocol or patient related information or demographics that may need to be altered in or to maximize the scientific value of the NNTC and perhaps minimize the research costs associated with maintaining a cohort. These results will be provided by reports. 

 Dr. Yiannoutsos, Ph.D has proprietary data (Far 6.302-1) due to the nature of the information obtained during the study performed by the NIMH.   Contracting with another contractor at this phase of this requirement would not provide any cost savings to the Government.

  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541690 and the Size Standard is $6.5. The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition using FAR 12 procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.  Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NOI60109 may be submitted to the NIDA, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition Branch, 31 Center Drive, Room 1B59,msc 2080 Bethesda, MD 20892

The purpose of this Purchase Order is to use the contractor's capabilities to better integrate EPA's Energy Performance Rating System and other ENERGY STAR tools in the performance contracting procurement process between  building owners, particularly states and educational Institutions, and Energy Services Companies (ESCO's).

Through NAESCO's membership of ESCO's, state energy offices, and private sector companies, NAESCO is in a unique position to be able to develop performance contracting process model language that will work for  public and private sector organizations interested in procuring energy services and the energy services companies providing them.   Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a capabilities statement, which if received by the  response date of this announcement may be considered.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 325211   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Security Management Division intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order for 30,000 PIV smart cards. Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) established policy for a common identification standard for Federal employees and certain contractors.  Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 201-1 implements the Directive by defining the overall technical requirements for Personal Identification Verification (PIV), the foundation of the common identification standard or PIV card.  All Federal agencies,  including EPA, must be fully PIV-compliant, including technical specifications, components and processes required for PIV interoperability, by October 27, 2006.  In order to meet the requirements and objectives of HSPD-12 and FIPS 201-1, the Agency has initiated the EPA Personnel Access and  Security System (EPASS).  This system will establish a compliant credentialing program that encompasses the full set of badge life cycle activities while enhancing the security of EPA employees and personnel, facilities and IT systems.   One of the key components of the Agency's EPASS is the PIV  card.  Oberthur, has developed cards compliant with all aspects of FIPS 201-1.  In addition, these cards have undergone testing by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), certification by the General Services Administration (GSA) and been placed on the Approved Products List  (APL).  Pursuant to the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) direction, all procurements related to implementation of HSPD-12 must be made using GSA's Schedule 70 and the APL.  The only known source for the PIV cards that meets this criteria is Oberthur Card Systems of America.  The Government  intends to award a purchase order resulting from this Request for Quote to the responsible business whose offer, conforming to the solicitation provisions, will be the most advantageous to the government.  Any firm believing itself to be capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may  submit a quote, which if received by close of business August 31, 2006 will be considered.  Responses to this posting must be in writing and submitted to Rachel Schwartz, Contracting Officer at Schwartz.rachel@epa.gov.

<DESC>This is a synopsis for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.5, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This solicitation document incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through August 2006 Federal Acquisition Regulation revision, which includes the consolidation of all Federal Acquisition Circulars through 2005-12.  This acquisition is 100% a small business set-aside and the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541512 with a small business size standard of $23.0 million.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) publishes a web-based listing of Funding Opportunity Announcements (FOAs) and Policy Notices called The “NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts”.  This is a dynamic listing that typically has 15 to 20 additional documents added to it each week.  Institutions that conduct biomedical research browse this listing to find sources of funding.  The “NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts” is published in NIH’s Office of Extramural Research (OER) which is located within the Office of the Director (OD).

The NIH is composed of approximately 28 institutes or centers (ICs), each with it’s own unique health research related mission.  ICs submit their funding announcements for review to the Office of Extramural Programs (OEP ) for review and publication in “The NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts”.  These funding opportunities are all posted to http://grants.nih.gov.  Before the ICs submit their announcements to OEP, they have their own unique internal workflow, review and clearance processes.

Currently, when an idea for a new FOA is conceived, the IC begins drafting an FOAs based on HTML templates that are issued by OD/OEP.  As the IC moves through it’s process, the document is converted to MS Word, emailed around for comment, revision and clearance and then submitted to OD/OEP for review and publication.  As of this writing there are a total of 12 different templates for the IC to select from based on the nature of their FOA.  When ready for publication to “The NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts”, the documents are converted back to HTML, some critical data items are entered into an MS SQL database and transmitted as an XML message to the Grants.gov system run by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).  

The objectives of this project are to investigate, recommend and implement a document or content management system in support of “The NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts” publication process.  This solution should supplant the current manual process of collaboration and review that goes into drafting and publishing funding announcements.  The management system will also need to exchange data with the existing ENS  and AGS  systems. 

Based on the availability of NIH funds, the Contractor shall furnish professional IT services to perform the tasks specified below:  This project consists of three Phases, Phase I primarily involves gathering requirements by analyzing the needs of the stakeholders, and studying the process of document contribution to “The NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts”.  Phase II includes the implementation of a workflow system.  Phase III incorporates all of the necessary business rules into the FOA templates .

Training, meetings with government staff members and product demonstrations must be performed at the Government site, other activities may be performed offsite at the Project Officer’s discretion. 

The contractor must be capable of responding (in person when necessary) within one hour of receiving a request from NIH with qualified technical support personnel to (6705 Rockledge Drive, Bethesda, MD).

The purchase order term will be September 30, 2006 through September 29, 2007 with option for four (4) successive one-year periods.  The FAR provisions and clauses sited herein are incorporated by reference into this solicitation.  Offerors are advised to propose in accordance with the provision of FAR 52.212 1, Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items.  Offerors are advised to provide with their offer a completed copy of the following provisions: FAR 52.212 3, Offeror Representations and Certifications Commercial Items (http://www.arnet.gov/far/).

Request for Quotations (RFQ) Number NLM-06 196-UHP will be available on or about August 31, 2006.  Request for RFQ-NLM-06 196-UHP may be obtained by writing to the National Library of Medicine, Office of Acquisitions Management, 8600 Rockville Pike, Building 38A, Room B1N20, Bethesda, Maryland 20894; Attention: Uyen H.

The original manual contained 19 chapters, was 3.5 inches thick, and was 1,132 pages long.  NRMRL wishes to contract with a knowledgeable professional(s) in the  area of sludge treatment and disposal.  This individual(s) will manage/oversee preparation of the new manual and be skilled at technical editing and writing.  The individual(s) will be expected to assemble materials provided from NRMRL and work with NRMRL to identify (volunteer) authors who can  help to prepare a first working draft.

The new manual will provide the latest design information on all applicable technologies available for treatment, use, and disposal of municipal wastewater  solids including grit, scum, screenings, primary sludges, biological sludges, chemical sludges, and septage.  The updated manual is intended to be a useful resource for writers and decision makers at the federal, state, and local levels as they confront wastewater treatment and water reclamation  and reuse issues. Significant organizational conflicts of interest (OCOI) exist under this procurement for the staff, officers, and members of the board of the following two scientific organizations: the Water Environment Federation (WEF) and the Water Environment Research Federation (WERF).   Therefore, it is considered in the best interest of the Government to preclude the staff, officers, and members of the board of WEF and WERF from award consideration as a prime contractor or subcontractor.  The solicitation will contain the following provision, "Prohibition of the Water Environment  Federation (WEF) and the Water Environment Research Federation (WERF) from Being Considered Eligible for Award".  The text of this clause will be as follows: 	The Water Environment Federation (WEF) specifically its staff, officers, and members of the board and the Water Environment Research  Federation (WERF) specifically its staff, officers, and members of the board shall be considered ineligible for the award as a prime or subcontractor on any contract resulting from this solicitation.  This action is being taken to eliminate significant organizational conflicts of interest concerns  that would arise from inclusion of these organizations in the competition for this acquisition.  THE EPA HAS SET THIS ACQUISITION ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESS. The North American Industry Classification Code is 541990 with a small business size standard of $6.5 million.  A written solicitation,  RFQ-OH-06-00219, is anticipated to be issued during the week of August 28, 2006.  It is anticipated the solicitation will be issued as a request for quotes (RFQ).  All responsible small businesses may submit a quotation in response to the solicitation which shall be considered by the Agency.  This  procurement will be pursued using FAR Part 12 Commercial Acquisition methods and procedures.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the lowest priced, technically acceptable, responsible  offeror whose offer meets the minimum needs of the goverment.  Contract type will be firm fixed price.

PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program.

Description of the Invention:

High capacity sulfur dioxide adsorbents based on the highly active manganese oxide octahedral molecular sieve OMS-2 (tunnel structure cryptomelane) have been developed. Their SO2 capacities from 250°C to 475°C are more than ten times higher than those of conventional metal oxide-based SO2 adsorbents. Their maximum SO2 capacities can be as high as 70 wt%. The dominant mechanism for SO2 absorption is through the oxidation of SO2 to SO3 by Mn4+ and Mn3+ followed by SO3 reaction with Mn2+ to form MnS04.  These high capacity SO2 adsorbents can be used for removal of SO2 generated from thermal power plants, factories, and on-road diesel engines, off-road diesel engines and marine diesels. They can be especially effective for removal of SOX present in the emissions of diesel trucks, in order to protect downstream emissions control devices such as particulate filters and NOx traps which are poisoned by SOx.  Reference 14004-E.

<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology.  License rights may be issued on an exclusive and non-exclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement.

The Hazardous Materials Acoustic Inspection Device (HAZAID) is a portable, battery-operated, handheld system for real-time, sealed-container inspection and contents (liquid/material) identification.  This acoustic technology directly addresses issues such as identification, confirmation or classification of substances and materials (CW agents, Hazardous/Flammable liquids, Liquid Explosives, etc.) during checkpoint security, field and first response operations, non-invasively and nondestructively.    Other technologies such as X-ray are often quite costly, bulky, inadequate (in their ability to identify liquid contents), and impractical for immediate response scenarios.  The HAZAID measurement platform is based upon correlating two acoustic physical property measurements (as a signature or fingerprint for identification/classification of liquids/solids) using nondestructive and non-invasive means for acquiring information through a solid material or liquid-filled sealed container.  Additional capabilities include an automated container distance and temperature measurement, automated gain function, automatic accommodation for wall-thickness and correction for acoustic reflection and transmission coefficients in various wall-materials have significantly improved the measurement consistency and accuracy over available COTS technologies, allowing for the identification and discrimination of a much wider array of liquids.  The HAZAID employs advanced acoustic signal processing methods to consistently and accurately measure the temperature corrected acoustic velocity (speed of sound) and relative acoustic attenuation in a fluid or material to:  (1) Detect  anomalies, contraband and hidden compartments in liquid-filled containers and solid form commodities; (2) Sort/Classify  liquid types into groups of like and unlike; (3) Identify  liquids and bulk-solids as a function of temperature, and; (4) Determine  the fill-level in liquid-filled containers.  The identification capability is based upon comparing the two measured acoustic signatures to pre-characterized profiles (acoustic velocity and relative attenuation as a function of temperature) of liquids and solids in the HAZAID database.  This versatile tool can be employed to rapidly screen bulk containers ranging in size from a 55 gallon drum down to test tube sized containers in the field, checking for materials that can be used to build weapons of mass destruction, containers concealing contraband and illegal substances, and containers that have been fraudulently labeled.  HAZAID significantly reduces the amount of time required to screen such containers at checkpoints, while at the same time increasing the reliability and accuracy of the screenings.

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than 15 days from the publication date of this notice summarizing the company’s business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.  Companies deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the technology.  Such information may require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement.  Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a commercial license will be required to submit a business plan within 30 days of the publication date of this notice. The Business Plan must show investment for production of the new product line, as well as the projected revenue stream and revenue strategy.  Please send letters of interest to the attention of the POC identified within this Notice.

Description of the Invention:

It is known that sulfur oxides contribute significantly and deleteriously to the overall performance of diesel engine emission after treatment systems, especially in the case of NOx traps.  A silver based, fast regenerable SO2 absorbent has been developed and is available for licensing.  This absorbent can work under the same lean-rich cycling conditions as imposed on the NOx traps and can be used to protect both the downstream particulate filter and the NOx trap in the diesel engine emission after treatment system.  Over a temperature range of 300 'C to 550'C, it can absorb virtually all of the SO2 in the exhaust gasses during the lean cycles and can be fully regenerated by short rich cycles at the same temperature. Applications on-highway, marine and off-highway diesel engine emission control. Reference 14872-E.

The Government anticipates making a fixed price award of a purchase order..  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 541720 and the size standard is $6.5M. This requirement is to obtain data on household holdings of Personal Computers, that include both demographic information on the purchaser and information on the characteristics of the good.  This data will be used to adjust the deflator for the value of the PC’s purchased by households for changes in consumer demographics.  The Bureau of Economic Analysis will use the data to assess the usefulness of the data for the construction of an adjustment to our price deflators for household purchases of PCs and a capital stock measure for household holdings of PCs.  The following are the data requirements: 1. The data must be from a representative survey of households. 2. The vendor must have consistent data for at least 15 years (although this pilot project involves only two years). 3. Data must be available for all PCs held by households (not just newly-purchased PCs). 4. Data on the peripheral equipment used with the PC must be available. 5. Data must provide demographic information on the households. 6. Data must provide detailed information on the type of PCs held by the household, the year they were purchased, and the uses to which the PCs are put.  All written responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information demonstrating their ability to meet the above requirements. The response must be sufficient to permit agency analysis to establish a bonafide capability to meet the requirements. Failure to submit such documentation will result in the Government proceeding as stated above. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Affirmative written responses must be received no later than 15-days after publication of this synopsis. All information in response to this notification must be submitted in writing to the attention of Amy.SandersWhite@noaa.gov, Purchasing Agent.

The results indicated that the Elements Repository outperformed the others in terms of meeting Data Architecture Repository (DAR) requirements. However, this product does not meet all VA DAR requirements and requires customizations. Customization services, especially backend modifications necessary to make the product run on Oracle 10g, cannot be provided by other vendors. This notice is not a request for offers. A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Firms who want to challenge the sole-source must submit an interest letter that demonstrates their firm's ability to provide an equivalent service. Interested parties must provide rationale, including pricing, as to why they should be considered. All interested firms must respond by August 28th 12:00 p.m. EST. Written inquiries or comments regarding this announcement may be emailed to shaundra.duggans@va.gov. Please reference Intent to Sole Source - Elements Repository.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

POSITION TITLE:	Regional Middle East Democracy and Governance Senior Program Specialist
MARKET VALUE:	GS-14 
PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:	2 years with possibility of extension. 
PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:	USAID/Cairo, Egypt
SECURITY ACCESS: 	Employment Authorization
AREA OF CONSIDERATION:	U.S. Citizens or U.S. resident aliens who are able to obtain the required security clearance.

Note: A candidate who is otherwise qualified, but does not meet full requirements of the position, may be appointed as a trainee and be required to serve at a lower grade level for the period of one year.

A. 	ORGANIZATIONAL LOCATION OF POSITION:
Although the position requires extensive travel to the Middle East, the incumbent residence will be in Cairo, Egypt.  Cairo is the largest city in Africa and the Middle East.  It has a number of urban problems such as severe pollution, and traffic congestion.  However, it is relatively crime-free and offers many cultural and recreational opportunities, including major museums, important historical sites, and most sports.  The Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea are easily reachable and provide opportunities for most water sports, especially snorkeling and scuba diving.


B.	POSITION TITLE OF DIRECT SUPERVISOR:
The Regional Middle East Democracy and Governance Senior Program Specialist will be supervised by, and will report to, the evelopment Officer of the OMEP office (Office of Middle East Programs) at USAID/Cairo, Egypt.

C.	OVERVIEW:
The new regional Office of Middle East Programs (OMEP) in the U.S. Agency for International Development, Egypt Mission (USAID/Egypt) is soliciting applications from qualified individuals to serve as the regional Middle East Democracy and Governance (DG) Senior Program Specialist.  Promoting democratic processes and good governance is a crucial challenge in the Middle East and North Africa region, and a priority goal of U.S. foreign policy.  In the past several decades, some reforms in democracy and governance have happened across the region. However, progress throughout the region is halting, and not inclusive.  The region suffers from limited popular participation in the political process and often from poor, unaccountable governance.  Many of the tactics to address problems of governance, weak democratic institutions and processes are bilateral in nature.  At the same time, a regional approach across USAID presence and non-presence countries is necessary for some efforts, such as sharing of Arabic based resources between bilateral programs and strengthening and establishing transnational associations, including professional associations and institutions that can help combat corruption and weak governance.  Further, helping national institutions to use better common practices should promote the transparency and good governance that serves as an incentive to investment and leads to social and political stability.  USAID pursues regional approaches to DG in order to further a main U.S. objective of mitigating conflict and promoting the culture of democracy in the Middle East.  OMEP’s role in carrying out these goals is to address transnational issues and opportunities, promote public-private partnerships, facilitate the exchange of information and ideas between countries, and engage multilateral institutions.  OMEP’s strategy will focus on the main components of youth, water, and DG.  Democracy and governance activities may include regional anti-corruption efforts, providing a forum for sharing of Arabic language best practices, and strengthening regional associations to combat bad governance. 

The Middle East DG Senior Program Specialist provides strategic and policy guidance and specialized technical assistance, and serves as a project/activity manager with OMEP, located within the USAID/Egypt Mission.  The position ensures timely and effective implementation of a portfolio of activities in support of the overall USAID regional strategy for the Middle East.  This position has the unique role of designing and establishing a strategy for the regional democracy program under USAID’s first regional Strategy for the Middle East and North Africa, covering USAID presence and non-presence countries, and starting-up a new portfolio of regional activities and technical assistance.  The incumbent will be required to maintain close coordination with the USAID bilateral missions in the Middle East, notably, in Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, West Bank/Gaza, and Yemen, as well as coordination with USAID/Washington’s Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and Bureau for Asia and the Near East (ANE), in order to collaborate on the design of regional activities, as well as the dissemination of information and expertise throughout the region. 

In addition to close coordination within USAID, the Middle East DG Senior Program Specialist will serve as a counterpart in the field to the USG agencies and actors working on DG in the Middle East and North Africa. The incumbent will provide expertise and strategic and policy guidance on democracy and governance in the Middle East. The incumbent will be required to develop a comprehensive understanding of all donor DG activities throughout the region, including USAID non-presence countries such as Libya and Syria.  Incumbent will coordinate with the Department of State’s (DOS) Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI) staff along with USAID/DCHA and ANE staff who regularly contribute to MEPI coordination efforts.  The regional Middle East DG Senior Program Specialist may serve as project manager for several MEPI activities.

The DG Senior Program Specialist would report to the OMEP Director.

OMEP’s strategy will focus on the main components of youth, water, and DG.  Democracy and governance activities may include regional anti-corruption efforts, providing a forum for sharing of Arabic language best practices, and strengthening regional associations to combat bad governance. 

The Middle East DG Senior Program Specialist provides strategic and policy guidance and specialized technical assistance, and serves as a project/activity manager with OMEP, located within the USAID/Egypt Mission.  The position ensures timely and effective implementation of a portfolio of activities in support of the overall USAID regional strategy for the Middle East.

In addition to close coordination within USAID, the Middle East DG Senior Program Specialist will serve as a counterpart in the field to the USG agencies and actors working on DG in the Middle East and North Africa. The incumbent will provide expertise and strategic and policy guidance on democracy and governance in the Middle East.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to issue a contract for support services for the Office of Accident Investigation's Aviation Safety Hotline Program located in Washington, DC.  The Aviation Safety Hotline Program provides a means for which persons, with specific information, report violations of Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations and unsafe aviation practices while maintaining their confidentiality or anonymity, if requested.  This announcement is a Market Survey/Request for Information. The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from SBA Certified 8(a) and Small Business concerns.  The FAA is seeking interested sources that are capable of providing program support services.   At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  This market survey is being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to aid the FAA in its determination as to whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses (SEDB) that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program, or whether it is more appropriate to conduct this procurement using other Small Business competitive procurement procedures.  The principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 561110, with a size standard of $6.5 Million.  Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA SEDB 8(A) Certification letter (if applicable). The failure to obtain adequate and appropriate SBA SEDB 8(a) or other small business participation in this Markey Survey MAY result in a determination to conduct this procurement under other competitive procedures.

***********************************- All items quoted shall be BRAND NAME ONLY - Justification: Based on the system functionality, work space limitations and manufacturer support, this technology has already been implemented for most of the USCENTCOM Network Operations Center. Due to expanding capabilities and to maintain a standard configuration the same systems are required. To ensure interoperability with currently installed systems, purchase of additional ClearCube units would seamlessly integrate into the current environment with zero system configuration changes and zero impact to users and the command. Furthermore, the cost of alternate equipment would be significantly higher due to having a stock multiple replacement parts benchstocks.  With the ClearCube solution, the end user is able to take advantage of current replacement parts benchstock vs. purchasing two sets of replacement parts. ************************************

<DESC>Work consists of furnishing all labor, materials, tools, expertise, testing, surveying, equipment, reports, samples, warranties, and transportation necessary to replace the existing 103 wideband radio-based systems and upgrade three (3) wideband radio-based systems with narrowband transceivers, as required in Engineering Technical Letter (ETL) 03-5, Converting Civil Engineering Radio Frequency Devices to Narrowband Technology, and upgrading/replacing 14 fire alarm panels at McConnell AFB, KS plus providing factory approved training for the equipment.  The following contract line items are included:

0001AA.  39 EA Transceivers, Monaco Enterprises Model BTX-F-4 Zone Replacement
0001AB.  41 EA Transceivers, Monaco Enterprises Model BTX-F-8 Zone Replacement

0001AG.   8 EA  Fire Alarm Panel Upgrade
0001AH.   6 EA  Fire Alarm Panel Upgrade

NOTICE TO OFFERORS:  In accordance with FAR 6.302-1 the Government has determined that the narrowband transceivers must be brand name Monaco Enterprises in order to communicate with the installation’s Monaco D-21 Fire Management System.  The proposed brand name only manufacturer is the manufacturer of the existing Monaco D-21 Fire Management System.  Only Monaco Transceivers will communicate with Monaco D-21 Fire Management System Receivers.  The company has proprietary rights to its systems (receivers and transceivers) and other brand name systems are not interchangeable with it.  It is not economically feasible to replace the fully operational Monaco D-21 Fire Management System and existing narrowband transceivers.  If another brand name was used it would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.
This is a Request for Proposal (RFP), Performance Price Trade-Off (PPTO) solicitation.  There will be no public bid opening. Award will be made based upon Best Value to the Government in accordance with FAR 15 and the terms in the solicitation.  The period of performance is expected to be 330 calendar days.  
 The magnitude of construction is between $500,000 and $1,000,000.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 238210.  The closing date and time for submission of offers will be contained in the solicitation package.  The entire solicitation, including the specifications and drawings, will be made available only on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) Web Site at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.   Potential offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation package, which should be on or about 18 August 2006, and any other pertinent information in order to download their own copy of the solicitation package and drawings.  Potential offerors MUST register at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/ in order to receive notification and/or changes to the solicitation.  All contractors MUST be registered in the Central Contractor Registration database and ORCA database or their proposal may not be considered. Contractors can obtain further information on the Central Contractor registration (CCR) and ORCA registration at web site http://www.ccr.gov/ and http://orca.bpn.gov/.  

While funds are not presently available within Air Mobility Command to fund this project, we anticipate funds will become available by 17 November 2006.  If current fiscal year (FY06) funds become available, contract awards will be made no later than 30 September 2006.  If FY06 funds are not available, projects will be funded with FY07 funds.  We expect to have FY07 funds by 17 November 2006.  Solicitation may be cancelled and all offers rejected before award but after solicitation closing date when cancellation is clearly in the Government’s best interest.  

Per AFFARS 5352.201-9101: An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.  Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).  If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R. Jackson, HQ AMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB, IL 62225-5022, (618) 229-0267, fax (618) 256-6668, e-mail: michael.jackson@scott.af.mil. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.  The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.  Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.

INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT AND LIMITED COMPETITION AWARD.  The Space and Missile Systems Center, Detachment 12 (SMC Det 12), Rocket Systems Launch Program (RSLP), Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico intends to solicit and negotiate a sole source five-year Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with ATK Thiokol, Inc, Corinne, Utah for the aging surveillance (AS) of the SR118 and SR120 motors (Peacekeeper stage 1 and 3 respectively). In addition, RSLP will conduct a competition after exclusion of sources for the SR119 motor (Peacekeeper stage 2) between ATK Thiokol and Aerojet-General Corporation, Rancho Cordova, California under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1), pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, agency’s minimum needs can be satisfied by unique services available from only one or a limited number of responsible sources.  This effort will acquire aging surveillance services for the former Peacekeeper rocket motors for Stages 1 through 3 in support of the RSLP.  The services will allow RSLP to utilize the former PK rocket motors in a variety of applications.  ATK Thiokol will provide the Aging Surveillance (AS) for the SR118 and SR120 due to ATK Thiokol’s unique capabilities as the Original Equipment Manufacture (OEM) and because they have provided AS for SR118, SR119, and SR120 for the last 7 years.  With regard to the SR119, RSLP will conduct a competition between ATK Thiokol and Aerojet, as these two companies have nearly the same unique capabilities.  Aerojet is the OEM and provided the AS support through 1997, and ATK Thiokol has provided AS services since 1997. Specific tasks will include providing all aspects of engineering and AS support, as required, to ensure flight worthiness on the SR118, SR119, and SR120 rocket motors and related components in support of RSLP. RSLP AS support requires the historical AS test data for all three motors in order to provide continuous trend analysis for determining the expected life of the motors and various age-sensitive components. This support includes test and analysis of the motors and components to determine 1) if there are age related trends, 2) the severity of the aging, and 3) mitigations to the effects of the aging.  For the SR119 and SR120 motors the government maintains a static fire capability and provides static fires.  For the SR118 motor the government requirement is for the contractor to maintain a static fire capability and provide static fires.  Additional support will include anomaly resolution or modification of the motor(s) related problem either identified from the AS program or due to a unique launch requirement. Interested firms should submit a Statement of Capability (SOC) within 30 days of this announcement.  Submit the SOC to Ms Racelle Jensen, SMC Det 12/PKN, 3548 Aberdeen Avenue S.E., Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico, 87117-5778.  The SOC must include sufficient detail to demonstrate possession of the requisite technical expertise.  Foreign firms are advised that they will not be allowed to participate in this acquisition as a prime contractor.  An ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from potential offerors. The purpose of the ombudsman is to receive and communicate concerns from potential offerors when an offeror prefers not to use established channels to communicate its concern during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The ombudsman will communicate certain offeror issues, disagreements, and recommendations on this acquisition to the proper channels. The ombudsman's role is not to diminish the authority of the program director or the contracting officer but to advocate an offeror's concern on a non-attribution basis. The ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern when requested by the offeror. The ombudsman will not participate in the evaluation of proposals or the source selection process for this acquisition. The ombudsman is Director of Staff, SMC/DS, Phone Number (310) 363-3571. No solicitation document exists at this time.  Request for a solicitation will receive no response.  Questions pertaining to this announcement shall be directed to Contracts Manager, Ms Racelle Jensen, SMC Det 12/PKN at (505) 846-5103 or by E-mail at racelle.jensen@kirtland.af.mil, Mel Pearson, Contracting Officer, (505) 853-3503 or by Email at mel.pearson@kirtland.af.mil.

<DESC>The purpose of amendment no 2 is to clarify and incorporate the following questions and answers to this A-E 8(a)solicitation. Question no 1: Specifically in the description of services to be procured (Fedbizopps) it stated that "each completed drawing and specification must undergo a bid ability and constructability review certified by a professional construction engineer with 20 or more years experience in construction".  Is the professional construction engineer required to be a team member, or are the services to be provided by a consultant contracted whenever required, using the standard procedures for sub-contracting consultants?   

Government response to question no 1: A professional construction engineer with 20 or more years is required to be a team member.

Question no 2: How is "professional construction engineer" defined?  to the best of may knowledge, that particular title is not recognized in Puerto Rico for the purposes of licenses, as opposed to the PE title that refers to an engineer who is duly-licensed to practice engineering in Puerto Rico.  There is no such requirement in order to be a general construction engineer in Puerto Rico.  Therefore, could those requirement be filled instead by a licensed professional engineer who has at least twenty years of construction experience.

Government response to question no 2: Yes, the requirement could be filled by a licensed professional engineer who has at least twenty years of construction experience.

Procurement continue to be set-aside for 8(a) certified SBA Business Development Program for Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Individuals.  

The services still required will be predominately Mechanical/Electrical Design with Architectural and Structural Supporting Services, in nature. Everything else referenced in the initial announcement and amendment no 1 shall remain the same and in full force. 

The Closing date has been changed from August 21st, 2006 to August 28th, 2006. 

Three copies of the submissions shall be placed in a sealed envelope clearly identified and appropriately marked as follows:  Solicitation No. GS-2P-06-PC-D-0072, Predominately Mechanical/Electrical Design with Architectural/Structural Supporting Services, for projects located in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, Closing Date: August 28, 2006.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541380   The RFQ is amended as follows. The hour and date specified for receipt of quotes is not extended.  Quoters must acknowledge receipt of this amendment prior to the hour and date specified on the quote, or by separate fax or hardcopy acknowledgement. Failure of your acknowledgement to be received by the CO via fax or hardcopy prior to the hour and date specified may result in rejection of your quote.  If by virtue of this amendment you desire to change a quote already submitted, such change may be made via a fax or hardcopy received by the CO prior to the date  and hour specified.   E-mail or phone amendment acknowledgements may not be accepted.  EPA Region III seeks fax or hardcopy quotes from concerns for the Delivery of Analytical Services - Radionuclides.  Fax or hardcopy quotes shall be received by the CO by 4pm ET on Th Aug 17 2006 (Fax  215/814-5211).  E-mail or phone quotes may not be accepted.  100% Small Business Setaside.  1) May state certified labs submit a quote? Yes.   2) Is the lab contractor going to receive one single container with all materials to be analyzed for all the radionuclides listed in Appendix A?; or a  separate container for each radionuclide? Samples shall be submitted as efficiently as possible, using the least amount of jars.  However, the volume and number of containers used may vary.   3) For assorted materials, must each swipe be analyzed for all  radionuclides? For the wipes and debris  samples, only three radionuclides are required to be analyzed.  For the building material samples, all radionuclides are required to be analyzed.  4) Approximately what will be amount of sample (g or kg) available  for analyses?  Approximately between 200-500 grams depending on the radionuclide.   5) Since the EPA 9XX methods listed in Appendix A are for drinking H2O, and the bldg material samples will be solids, does it mean that the contractor lab may select any approved method to digest, dissolve  or distill the sample and then continue with the appropriate EPA 9XX method listed in  Appendix A? The laboratory can use any modifications they need to prep the samples for the analyses, as long as they can meet the required detection limits.  6) It is understood that it is allowed to analyze gamma spectrometry those radionuclides such as Cs-137 and Co-60.  Is that correct? Yes.  7)  How many and which type of QC samples such as blanks, duplicates, spikes, etc do you require per group?   For laboratory QC, typically every 20 samples should have associated QC samples including lab duplicates, blanks, and spikes. 8) Is Tl204 correct or is it Tl208?  Tl-204.  9) CLP does not have  a standard reporting format for radiological data, will a Level 4 data package be acceptable? The data package should contain all Forms and raw data necessary for the Govt to perform a full validation.  10)  Example: Ac227 you measure the Th227 activity in the sample.  May DOE LANL ER200 be used  for Th analysis? Yes.  12) What time frame will the samples be collected?  Will they be submitted at once or over a period of time?  The samples will probably be submitted over a month from the date of order but no later than 11/15/06.  13) Will all the analyses be collected on each sample or will  some samples get one or only a few of the anlayses?  For the wipes and debris samples, only three radionuclides are required to be analyzed.  For the building material samples, all radionuclides are required to be analyzed. 14) Will lab contractor staff be required to attend legal proceedings in  person? In the very unlikely event that lab contractor staff will be required to attend any legal proceedings, the order will be modified to pay the lab contractor for reasonable expenses. Except as provided herein, all terms and conditions remain unchanged and in full force and effect. The RFQ  is posted at http://www.epa.gov/region03/request_for_quote.pdf

<DESC>SYNOPSIS for ITES-2H.  The U.S. Army Small Computer Program (ASCP) in coordination with the Army Contracting Agency (ACA), Information Technology, E-Commerce and Commercial Contracting Center (ITEC4), intends to release a Draft Request For Proposal ( RFP) to support the Armys requirement for commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware, consisting of, but not limited to purchase or lease of COTS servers, workstations, managed platforms (both desktops and notebooks), thin client devices, networking equipme nt, storage systems, network cabling, video teleconferencing products (VTC), as well as associated factory orderable upgrades and related peripherals such as printers, scanners, digital cameras, displays (including plasma, Cathode Ray Tube (CRT), Digital L ight Processor (DLP), Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) High Definition Television (HDTV), equipment cabinets, transit cases, and other related accessories. The contracts will be open to other Agencies (i.e. Navy, Air Force, DoD components, FMS, and other Feder al agencies) to satisfy their Information Technology requirements (IT).  IT products procured through this acquisition are required to comply with DoD and Army standards, such as the DoD IT Standards Registry  Federal Information Processing Standards.  The  Army intends to award multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contracts. The contract will have a five-year period of performance with a three-year base period and two (2) one  year options.  The total estimated value is $5B.  The Government wil l conduct the acquisition under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12. The government intends to conduct a full and open competition with up to two awards reserved for small business. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code fo r this acquisition is 517110 (Telecommunications Network, Wired) with small business size standard of 1,500 employees.  Contractors will be required to support up to a Secret security clearance.  Some orders may require Top Secret (TS) Sensitive Compartmen ted Information (SCI).  Delivery to the address(es) specified on each delivery order shall be within 30 calendar days for CONUS and 35 calendar days for OCONUS locations.  The price of shipping CONUS will be included in the fixed price of the product.  The  price of shipping OCONUS will be handled as an ODC, within restraints, negotiated at the order level.  The Contractor shall provide commercial on-site warranties to all locations within and Outside the Continental United States (CONUS/OCONUS) for all prod ucts delivered.  On-site or mail-back or hot-swap warranty shall be offered to the customer for portable systems.  The Government shall not incur additional charges (i.e. shipping, delivery) for warranty support.  The option to purchase extended warranties  in one-year increments shall be offered for all products delivered.  Any time-of-purchase restrictions for the purchase of extended warranties shall be in accordance with the contractors policy.  The Contractor shall provide a method for performing warra nty service for Remote OCONUS locations.  The Contractor shall provide for the repair or replacement of equipment including transportation/shipping costs to and from the customers site.  The warranty period shall commence upon the receipt of the equipment  at the final destination identified on the delivery order or 35 days after shipment from the contractors facility, whichever is sooner.  Due to the security limitations in South Korea and delays associated with custom clearance, limited Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) will be included for that country to enable contract performance.  NOTE:  The Government intends to utilize an Advisory Multi-Step process in accordance with FAR 15.202 to allow the Government the opportunity to advise offerors about their  potential to be viable competitors.  In order to participate in the Advisory Multi-Step process, potential prime contractors will respond to the Governments f orthcoming request to submit qualifying documentation demonstrating their experience and capabilities.  The draft acquisition schedule is provided as follows.  All dates are subject to change. The Draft Request for Proposal (RFP) will be released on June 1 , 2006.  Industry Day will be held on June 15, 2006.  The Advisory Multi-Step will be released on June 26, 2006 with submissions due July 10, 2006.  The Government will release viability notifications July 31, 2006.  The Final RFP will be released on Augus t 8, 2006.  The proposals will be due 30 days after Final RFP release.  Vendors may access information and documentation regarding the ITES-2H acquisition through the FBO website, http://www.fedbizopps.gov/, or directly at the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) website, https://acquisition.army.mil/.  To obtain pertinent information updates and notices to the acquisition as it progresses, please go to the ATTACHMENTS link located at the bottom of the solicitation view page on the ASFI webpage.

Based on the information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the Government considers the supplies specified as a sole source from SANZ, Inc., Englewood, Colorado and proposes to negotiate a buyout contract with this company on that basis. The software being utilized on the already existing system is proprietary and currently only licensed by SANZ, Inc. However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered. Firms who feel they can furnish the required multiple integrated hardware and software components or its functional equivalent (based on the criteria specified herein) are invited to submit, in writing, an affirmative response to this announcement within ten days after the date of publication of this synopsis. Written notification must include the company name, telephone number, point of contact and sufficient product literature for the government to make a decision. An affirmative response would include literature, brochures, and such other materials which correspond to the required services and supplies stated herein. This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist. No solicitation document exists, therefore, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration.

<DESC>INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT AND LIMITED COMPETITION AWARD.  The Space and Missile Systems Center, Detachment 12 (SMC Det 12), Rocket Systems Launch Program (RSLP), Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico intends to solicit and negotiate a sole source five-year Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with ATK Thiokol, Inc, Corinne, Utah for the aging surveillance (AS) of the SR118 and SR120 motors (Peacekeeper stage 1 and 3 respectively). In addition, RSLP will conduct a competition after exclusion of sources for the SR119 motor (Peacekeeper stage 2) between ATK Thiokol and Aerojet-General Corporation, Rancho Cordova, California under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1), pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(i), agency’s minimum needs can be satisfied by unique services available from only one or a limited number of responsible sources.  This effort will acquire aging surveillance services for the former Peacekeeper rocket motors for Stages 1 through 3 in support of the RSLP.  The services will allow RSLP to utilize the former PK rocket motors in a variety of applications.  ATK Thiokol will provide the Aging Surveillance (AS) for the SR118 and SR120 due to ATK Thiokol’s unique capabilities as the Original Equipment Manufacture (OEM) and because they have provided AS for SR118, SR119, and SR120 for the last 7 years.  With regard to the SR119, RSLP will conduct a competition between ATK Thiokol and Aerojet, as these two companies have nearly the same unique capabilities.  Aerojet is the OEM and provided the AS support through 1997, and ATK Thiokol has provided AS services since 1997. Specific tasks will include providing all aspects of engineering and AS support, as required, to ensure flight worthiness on the SR118, SR119, and SR120 rocket motors and related components in support of RSLP. RSLP AS support requires the historical AS test data for all three motors in order to provide continuous trend analysis for determining the expected life of the motors and various age-sensitive components. This support includes test and analysis of the motors and components to determine 1) if there are age related trends, 2) the severity of the aging, and 3) mitigations to the effects of the aging.  For the SR119 and SR120 motors the government maintains a static fire capability and provides static fires.  For the SR118 motor the government requirement is for the contractor to maintain a static fire capability and provide static fires.  Additional support will include anomaly resolution or modification of the motor(s) related problem either identified from the AS program or due to a unique launch requirement. Interested firms should submit a Statement of Capability (SOC) within 30 days of this announcement.  Submit the SOC to Ms Racelle Jensen, SMC Det 12/PKN, 3548 Aberdeen Avenue S.E., Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico, 87117-5778.  The SOC must include sufficient detail to demonstrate possession of the requisite technical expertise.  Foreign firms are advised that they will not be allowed to participate in this acquisition as a prime contractor.  An ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from potential offerors. The purpose of the ombudsman is to receive and communicate concerns from potential offerors when an offeror prefers not to use established channels to communicate its concern during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The ombudsman will communicate certain offeror issues, disagreements, and recommendations on this acquisition to the proper channels. The ombudsman's role is not to diminish the authority of the program director or the contracting officer but to advocate an offeror's concern on a non-attribution basis. The ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern when requested by the offeror. The ombudsman will not participate in the evaluation of proposals or the source selection process for this acquisition. The ombudsman is Director of Staff, SMC/DS, Phone Number (310) 363-3571. No solicitation document exists at this time.  Request for a solicitation will receive no response.  Questions pertaining to this announcement shall be directed to Contracts Manager, Ms Racelle Jensen, SMC Det 12/PKN at (505) 846-5103 or by E-mail at racelle.jensen@kirtland.af.mil, Mel Pearson, Contracting Officer, (505) 853-3503 or by Email at mel.pearson@kirtland.af.mil.

The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Grain Inspection, Packer and Stockyards Administration GIPSA, Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS) is conducting market research to determine the existence of commercial sources capable of providing an existing hand held light weight portable device or capable of manufacturing a hand held light weight portable device which will assist FGIS inspection personnel in visually examining the interior of railroad freight hopper car(s) (car) from ground level eliminating the need for them to climb nearly 16 feet to the car’s top to examine its interior through 27 inch compartment hatch cover openings on its top.  FGIS performs this examination as a service to determine if the car’s interior is clean, dry and suitable to carry various agricultural products.

USDA developed and field tested a prototype to determine the feasibility of performing examinations of hopper cars from ground level.  The prototype consisted of a video camera attached to a lightweight frame which was held over the hopper car’s opening on the top of the hopper car from the ground by an inspector.  FGIS found that performing examinations using this method is possible, but that the prototype device was too clumsy to be practical.  

DESCRIPTION OF USDA DEVELOPED PROTOTYPE:     A commercial webcam (Logitech Orbit, 640 x 480 pixel resolution, with motorized pan and tilt – weight 9 ounces), mounted at the end of a lightweight wooden framework (14 feet high with an arm extending over the railcar) and connected to a laptop computer by a USB cable.  The 14 foot upright portion was constructed in two sections, one 8 feet long and the other 7 feet long, which could be bolted together at the site of the hopper car stowage examination. The horizontal arm had a total length of 96 inches.  The camera was mounted 72 inches from where the arm was bolted to the upright portion of the framework.  The arm extended 18 inches out past the camera.  Two triangular projections were bolted to the bottom of the arm on either side of the camera.  These projections rested on the inside edges of the compartment opening to support the camera’s weight and center it over the hopper car compartment opening.  The arm also extended 6 inches on the other side of the upright portion, where the end of the arm was bolted to a brace.

OBJECTIVES:    Develop an improved device to allow the USDA personnel to examine the interior of hopper cars while standing on the ground.  The device must have:  1. Light weight material;   2.   Ease of collapsing the device and extending or reassembling it by one person at the side of the hopper car;   3. Stability;    4.  Capability and ease of viewing the interior of the hopper car;    5.  Ability to view the gaskets around the compartment hatches;   6.  Protection from shock if the device come into contact with an overhead electrical wire.

SCOPE OF WORK:   The contractor shall design and build one (1) portable light weight handheld device incorporating one or more video camera which will allow USDA personnel to visually examine with ease the interior of railroad hopper cars and meet the above objectives.

REQUIREMENTS:  Color video camera with a field of view of approximately 40 degrees or greater and resolution of 640 x 480 pixels or greater; camera must be able to pan and tilt; wireless; lightweight and very stiff support that the camera will be mounted on and can be handheld by the USDA inspector; a viewing screen on the vertical part of the support t about eye level which will display the color image from the camera without loss of resolution.


RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS:   USDA is seeking information, comments, recommendations, and statements of capabilities from interested parties with related and continuous experience in designing, developing or manufacturing these or similar type devices. 

Interested parties are encouraged to provide a response to this RFI.  Responses shall contain sufficient documentation to convey the organization’s capability to provide the defined device.  

Responders shall provide an overview of their company.  This overview shall include: Company name; a contact person’s name, phone number and email address; a brief description of company history;  business classification status in accordance with NAICS code 541990 defining a small business as revenue under $5.0 million; and an explanation of core services company currently provides to customers, 

The closing date for the receipt of responses is AUGUST 29, 2006 at 10:00 A.M. CENTRAL DAYLIGHT TIME.  Responses this RFI may be submitted to Joanne Mann by fax (612) 370-2136, or email to  Joanne.Mann@aphis.usda.gov , referencing RFI-06-53322

An acceptable REM system would be a simple, one operator, single pass, small footprint machine that performs many functions and is able to process mail up to 3/8" or better.  Its OCR system would enable it to encode rejects or the non-read letter mail from the ISS/OSS machines, Loop Mail and RTS mail.  It would utilize a camera and binarization system that produces ideal images for its advanced programmed algorithms.  The machine would apply a linerless label over the barcode clear zone, spray a correct POSTNET, verify the POSTNET, and sort for downstream local or destination processing.  It would print a human readable alpha-numeric stream using red ink, and update the Identification Code Sorting (ICS) file as needed.  The ISS and OSS encode, Finest Depth of Sort and error rates shall be in the range of 55% to 75%, 95% to 99% and 0.5% to 1.5% respectively.    It would have the capability to read and print 4State Barcodes, and separate ACS mail. The footprint shall not exceed 90 sq ft and the throughput shall exceed 10,000 pieces per hour.

Schedule & Deliverables

For purposes of this technology assessment and market survey, potential vendors shall provide REM system descriptions with performance data for USPS review.  This information should include a complete description of a working unit which substantiates the vendor’s ability to meet the technical requirements.  This written information shall be delivered to Mr. Tom Raspet (address noted above) no later than March 31, 2006.  Minor variations to the values expressed within the above technical requirements will be considered by the USPS if such systems are currently in use in other postal administrations or market applications.  In the event that a potential vendor currently has or plans to develop a system which will meet the requirements provided herein, such vendor must provide a date by April 03, 2006 when those development activities would be completed and their system be available for USPS review.  Following USPS review of the submitted REM system descriptions with performance data, a pre-qualification determination will be made and if appropriate competitive evaluation testing plans will be furnished.  The prequalified suppliers will be firms whose record of performance in the market place has demonstrated their ability to perform to consistently high standards.  The USPS will not provide funding for development activities associated with meeting the specified requirements.  Interested parties shall submit a total of three copies (two hard copy and one soft data copy) of any company promotional handouts, brochures, catalogs, technology performance specifications, and operations manuals of equipment that meets or exceeds these specifications and requirements to the address provided in this announcement.

<DESC>The 45 Space Wing issues this sources sought synopsis for information and planning purposes in support of the possible acquisition of atmospheric gas analysis services.  This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the government nor will the government pay for information solicited.  The services to be acquired are primarily concerned with the processing separation and radioassay of atmospheric gas samples for elemental determination of sample components for the purpose of nuclear test ban treaty verification.  Definition of some terms:  bottle = 900cc steel container filled with whole air constituents requiring processing for analysis; sample = physical object requiring processing to isolate selected atmospheric radioactive effluent gasses of interest for analysis.  Gas analysis requires the ability to:  (a) be proficient with various radioactive gas counting techniques; (b) determine, prior to separation, the percent of oxygen and nitrogen and the volume (in cubic centimeters) of other selected effluent gases within sample bottles; (c) separate selected radioactive effluent gases, as required, from cryogenic arid whole air samples; (d) radioassay separated samples; and (e) maintain capability to process and analyze samples from surge of additional collections, as required.  Requests for these analyses may occur with little notice and may require 8-hour to 24-hour analysis capability.  Other requirements include:  (a) In the event the government elects to procure atmospheric gas analysis services, prospective sources must possess, or show the capability to obtain, a US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Radioactive Materials License (or an agreement state license/permit, as applicable for the facility where work will he performed), prior to performance start; (b) Offeror shall be responsible for providing a suitable site for performance of the contract requirements.  Unique analysis equipment essential to the mission will be provided, with ownership retained by the government.  Due to the potential of contaminating mission samples, analysis equipment, and areas of any facility used for gas analysis services, shall not be used for activities other than government work without the expressed written permission of the government program office and shall be isolated from other facilities doing nuclear work; and (c) Prospective sources would be required to have DOD security clearances of at least the SECRET NOFORN (NOT RELEASABLE TO FOREIGN NATIONALS) level.  A firm-fixed-price contract is contemplated with a one-year basic contract period and four 1-year options.  Participation in this potential effort would require both a facilities clearance and storage capability of at least the SECRET NOFORN level.  Prospective sources would be required to support secure communication capabilities at the SECRET NOFORN level.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and size standard are 541380/$11.0 million.  No technical or solicitation documents exist at this time.  Interested offerors having the required specialized capabilities to meet the above requirements should submit a capability statement of 10 pages or less indicating their ability to perform all aspects of the effort described herein.  Firms must respond electronically to Ms Lois Brockson at lois.brockson@patrick.af.mil within 30 days from the date of publication.  NO PHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED.  Firms responding must state whether they are a Small Business (SB), Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Woman-owned Small Business (WQSB), Historically Black College or University or Minority Institution (HBCU/MI), an 8(a) firm, a Native American firm, a HUBZone firm, a Veteran-Owned Small Business Concern, a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Concern, a participant in the Very Small Business Pilot Program, or a large business based on the size standard above.  The government reserves the right to set this acquisition aside for any of the above type organizations based on the responses received.

<DESC>*** Technical Requirements for Data Encryption Solution ***  

***Introduction: The Securities and Exchange Commission seeks a technical solution for the encryption of all user data on all agency laptops and portable media devices. The technical solution must satisfy all the following requirements.***   

***Security Requirements:   

•	The product must encrypt the entire hard disk (full-disk) so that if a disk were pulled and analyzed on a sector by sector basis, it would be unreadable.

•	The product must encrypt hibernation and other system files.

•	The product must ensure that encrypted volumes, including the operating system, are only accessible after the user enters a pre-OS password to decrypt the volume. 

•	The product must encrypt all removable media upon connection to the system after allowing the user to cancel the encryption based on SEC policy. The product must allow the administrator to refuse to mount a device for which the user has cancelled encryption. 

•	The product must encrypt read-only media on creation based on user or administrator preferences.

•	The product must use strong Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithms with 256 bit key lengths at a minimum.

•	The structure of passwords used in the product must contain at least eight characters and must contain at least one lower-case alphabetic character, one upper-case alphabetic character, one digit (0-9), and one special character (e.g., #, $, etc).   

***Management and Recovery Requirements:   
	
•	The product must allow enterprise policies to be centrally configured.

•	The product must be fully integrated with Active Directory for managing policies and user authentication.	

•	The product must allow enterprise policies to always override locally configured policies.

•	The product must allow administrators to dynamically access all files on the drive regardless of their state of encryption; ensure that an employee’s files are accessible for years after the employee has left the SEC; ensure that EnCase Enterprise agents are always able to pull data; and ensure that automated remote processes running with credentials (for example, vulnerability scanning platforms) operate unhindered.

•	The product must allow administrators to reset a user’s password and be able to force the user to change it on the user’s next logon.

•	The product must centrally report all policy compliance events, and centrally report all software errors including, at a minimum, encryption errors, software corruption, and authentication errors.	

•	The product must allow application of patches and updates regardless of whether the user is logged into the bios-level encryption application or the Windows operating system.	

•	The product must support single-sign on technology, thereby ensure users are only required to log into the bios-encryption application when during a “Cold Boot”.

•	The product must support Wake on LAN remote management feature whereby a network message (“Magic Packet”) is sent to a workstation to cause it to turn itself to a fully operational state..

•	The product must allow the remote installation of software updates through SMS or other enterprise-wide management tools without having to decrypt/re-encrypt the hard drive.	

•	The product must allow remote software installations and upgrades without hindrance and without user log on or require any manual intervention to the computer.

•	The product must allow patch management (Bigfix, WSUS, and SMS 2003) to occur without hindrance on encrypted laptops that touch the network.   

***Self-Service and Helpdesk Support Requirements:   

•	The product must allow help desk technicians who are not domain administrators to help users with remote recovery in the event of a data lockout. 

•	The product must allow users to recover by themselves using a recovery disk or self-service password recovery questions.   

***Encryption Software Installation and Deployment Requirements:   

•	The product must have client application that can be cleanly packaged and installed using SMS. 

•	The product must have an administrator configurable message during installation. For instance, it could be used to alert users that their disks are being encrypted and not to attempt a shut-down or restart of their systems until the encryption is complete.

•	The product must allow interruption by power-loss or disconnection from the network of the encryption process without data corruption.   

***Portable Media Encryption:   

•	The product must be able to encrypt all portable media storage devices including USB and USB2 based thumb drives, floppy disks, DVD/R’s, and CD/R’s.

•	The product must be able to encrypt all portable media without user intervention.

•	The product must be able to decrypt data encrypted on portable media devices from any computer, including computers that have not been encrypted, provided the correct user credentials are applied.  

•	The product must not have any limitations on the number of times that data can be encrypted or decrypted on portable media storage devices.

•	The product must be able to encrypt current PDA technologies including Palm and Treo.

•	The product must provide central management of policies that can be applied to all workstations that encrypt portable media.             

***Integration Services:

•	On-site (at SEC) integration services are required for approximately two (2) weeks to plan, engineer and deploy the technical data encryption solution.             


 ******  Interested GSA Schedule holders should respond via email to baierl@sec.gov and provide:  (1) name of company, (2) GSA Schedule contract number and expiration date, (3) brief statement that vendor can provide a product and service that meets ALL of the requirements listed.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Announcement only for purposes of conducting Market Research.  There is no solicitation available at this time.  Request for a  solicitation will not receive a response. The Southern Region Contracting Center- East (SRCC-E), Ft McPherson, Georgia is conducting market research to find  out how many sources are available to conduct foreign language training.  Background  information:  There is a burgeoning need for foreign language requirements  throughout the Department of Defense (DoD) attributable to the Global War on  Terrorism and the Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.   Within DoD there is a  tremendous shortfall of linguists to support the Global War on Terrorism in a number  of languages such as Arabic, Dari, Pashto and other low density languages.  The Army  has faced this challenge in a variety of ways to include increased instruction for  Soldiers, increased performance of document exploitation (i.e.translations) and  development of self-paced curricula for low density languages in the Global War on  Terrorism.  To facilitate training in US Army Forces Command (FORSCOM), Command  Language Programs (CLPs) are the vehicle for accomplishing this mission-critical  language training.  Additionally, there are new requirements for the higher levels  of language proficiency to accomplish military tasks and expanded technical  requirements necessary for commanders to ensure linguist proficiency.  CLPs provide  facilities, equipment and a workable combination of classroom instruction, self- paced training opportunities, web based instruction and unit training to meet the  needs of professional Army linguists, as well as all other Army personnel requiring  foreign languages in performance of their military mission and duties.   As the Army  participates in JOINT missions, CLPs may also provide services to linguists from  other branches of the military such as the Air Force, Marines and Navy.  The Marine  Command and Staff College and Quantico, Virginia will conduct Familiarization  Training in French and Arabic under this contract.  Other Army Major Subordinate  Commands (MSCs) such as INSCOM, the Army National Guard Bureau or other DoD agencies  such as the Defense Language Institute Foreign Language Center (DLIFLC)  may contract for foreign language instruction or other language services such as  curricula development or translation under this contract.  Agencies such as the  National Virtual Translation Center (NVTC) may also procure translation services  under this contract. The Contractor shall provide foreign language instructors and  technology services and the appropriate level of management and administrative  functions to support the FORSCOM CLP and will train Military Intelligence (MI) Military Occupation Specialty (MOS) language-required, mission essential foreign  language skills to professional Active Component (AC) and Reserve Component (RC)  linguists.  Primary regional sites are at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, Fort Hood,  Texas and Fort Lewis, Washington.   The majority of the linguists are graduates of  the resident courses at DLIFLC holding language required MOSs. Soldiers of all MOSs  may participate in pre-deployment familiarization training. Training ranges from  survival language/cultural awareness orientations of varying lengths from one or two  hours to months of training for Soldiers deploying to foreign countries as well as  beginning level language training for specified units; refresher, maintenance and  sustainment global language training; intensive or iso-immersion type courses and  MOS/mission specific training for military linguists.  RC units from all  services are trained in full-time study during two-week annual training periods and  on Saturday and Sunday monthly drill weekends.

<SUBJECT>D -- IT equipment to process and reduce a variety of data collected by and associated with satellites in earth orbit.
<DESC>The General services administration has a requirement for the Department of the Army to do a sole source logical follow-on contract in accordance with 6.302-1.  The computer controlled IT equipment is referred to as an Anemometer Cross-track Measurement Experiment (ACME) and is available only from the University of Texas at Dallas, who has developed this instrument under a previous task contract .  The AFRL conducts ongoing research which often requires complex IT equipment to process and reduce a variety of data collected by and associated with satellites in earth orbit.  The purpose of this acquisition is to provide the AFRL with an ACME, a computer controlled device which will be used to collect, process, and communicate data associated with a satellite in a circular orbit.   The ACME is the only known instrument that can measure the satellite neutral cross-track winds at a 350-kilometer altitude.  A previous ACME  has been delivered and integrated onto the Air Force C/NOFS satellite to be launched in early 2006. Also an ACME has been successfully flown on a sounding rocket and is therefore a  developed and proven technology.  Because of delays in the availability of a launch with a suitable circular orbit, the task wass been delayed and can not be completed by the required delivery date of 11-30-2005.  This sole source contract is proposed by GSA as a means to finish the remaining work.  The Statutory authority fir other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 23(c)(1).

<SUBJECT>R -- Web-Based Language Learning Application - Completion of the U.S.- China E-Language Learning System
<DESC>The Department's Request for Information (RFI)/Market Research regarding the e-Language Learning System (eLLS) is completed.   A market research analysis designed to assess current industry capability and interest in further developing the eLLS project was conducted.  A number of private sector organizations participated in the market research and related follow-up activities.  Based on the results of this market research, and the interest expressed by the participating private sector organizations, we believe there is strong interest in the private sector in further developing the eLLS project.  To support those in the field who can benefit from the research and development completed by the Department, the Department has released the eLLS system into the public domain by publishing the following items on the Department's web site:

1.  The source code for the eLLS technology platform, minus proprietary software components for voice recognition and learning management.

2.  Thirty-six English language scripts written by English as a second language experts and aligned with content standards.

As a second step, to be completed over the next few months, the Department intends to add open source voice recognition and learning management software so that the software is a complete functional unit.  Without adding these components, the underlying source code has limited use to those in the field who would like to take advantage of this work.

The Department eventually intends to evaluate any built and implemented system that meets our technical and pedagogical specifications, as originally conceptualized in this research and development effort.  Our first priority is to evaluate the English language implementation of the e-language learning system with a Chinese-speaking student population.  In addition, we will consider evaluating a built and implemented English language system that is targeted on a Spanish-speaking student population.
From the beginning of this project, the Department's goal has been to provide sound research that could be used to advance the technology of language learning for the benefit of our nation's children.  We ask for your support in this effort, and continue to welcome your views on this subject.  Finally, we encourage you to take an active role in further developing the eLLS or incorporating its strategies, scripts, and approaches into your current efforts.

Please note, the Government will not pay for the provision of any information nor will it compensate any respondents for the development of such information. This notice is NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract.  ED will not be responsible for any costs incurred in responding to this notice.

<SUBJECT>A -- Urban Database Generation Toolset Request for Information
<DESC>The Rapid Unified Generation of Urban Databases (RUGUD) Army Technology Objective (ATO) is requesting information regarding commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) and government off-the-shelf (GOTS) tool capabilities for inclusion in an urban database generation capability. The RUGUD program supports the Synthetic Environment Core’s Database Virtual Environment Development (DVED). 

The concept behind RUGUD is an open framework that allows COTS and GOTS tools to work cooperatively to compose terrain generation systems. RUGUD provides the infrastructure to track, manage, and manipulate data as it moves through the system, but relies on COTS and GOTS tools to perform import, cleanup, conflation, and tailoring, and export of data into multiple disparate end-use products.  One of the main goals of the RUGUD framework is to allow the use of the best COTS/GOTS tool for each component of the terrain generation process.  This request for information (RFI) is being issued to survey Other Government Agencies, Private Industry and Academia, to collect information and data that would be useful in exploring terrain generation capabilities.  

Purpose for the Request for Information:
This is not a solicitation for contract.  The purpose of this request for information (RFI) is to survey Other Government Agencies, Industry and Academia, in order to collect information and data about urban database generation capabilities.  

Other Government Agencies, Industry and Academia Participation:
This exercise will identify other government, industry and university organizations that have an interest in providing information on their recent developments and future plans for urban generation capabilities.  All interested technology providers/vendors are invited to participate in this exercise on a purely voluntary basis.  

Survey Information: 
Please include information regarding each of the following in your response. These include 
•	cost, 
•	licensing, 
•	breadth and maturity of the tool to meet a particular component capability, 
•	ability to execute through API or parameterized command-line,
•	ability to execute individual capabilities independent of others (e.g. generate TIN).

RUGUD attempts to use the best tool available for any particular terrain generation capability. As such, lack of capability in one or more areas does not exclude a tool from consideration.

In addition to the information provided above use the following numbered weights to indicate the level of maturity of each identified capability.  Guidance is as follows:

4 – Industry leading capability
3 – In line with current industry capability
2 – Individual pieces needed to compose capability exist and can be instrumented collectively to satisfy capability
1 – Some capability and/or near-term (within 1 year) planned enhancements
0 – little or no capability exists

An “explanation of capability” statement should be included to provide justification for the rating. 




Please provide all or as much information as possible on compact disks, DVDs, memory sticks and/or other appropriate digital media no later than  31 August 2006 to the Simulation & Training Technology Center (STTC)/RDECOM, ATTN:  Mr. Julio De La Cruz, 12423 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL  32826-3276.
	
*It is anticipated that the results of the RFI will identify other government agencies, private industry and academia that have an interest in providing information on their recent developments and future plans for urban generation capabilities.  This is not a solicitation for a contract; however, those entities that respond with information should submit their response no later than 31 August 2006 to the attention of Mr. Julio De La Cruz, Lead Principal Investigator, Phone (407) 384-3733, Fax (407) 384-5440, email address Julio.Delacruz@us.army.mil.

Development and publication of a technology roadmap does not constitute Army/ RDECOM/STTC direction to start any contractual efforts.  All participation from interested technology providers/vendors is on a purely voluntary basis.  This RFI is for planning purposes only, and should not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP) or solicitation of an offer.  RDECOM-STTC does not intend to award a contract on the basis of the information provided or otherwise pay for this information.  RDECOM-STTC will not provide reimbursement for any cost associated with responding to this RFI.

All Federal Acquisition Regulation references and clauses can be viewed at the following link: http://farsite.hill.af.mil/vffara.htm STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW) For  DOCUMENT SCANNING and INDEXING  Of FEDERAL and  BACKLOGGED INDIAN RECORDS SCANNING REQUIREMENTS Financial Management (FM) Project Purpose The Indian Oil & Gas Project has evolved to provide improved maintenance and electronic access to all Federal and Indian oil and gas lease, agreement, and correspondence files.  The Indian Oil & Gas project, which is currently underway, involves the imaging and indexing of approximately 60,000 pages.  As the Indian project continues, Minerals Management Service (MMS) seeks to begin a second phase.  This phase will include all (both Federal and Indian) lease, agreement, and correspondence files plus deposit tickets and associated check stubs.  MMS will continue to evaluate the possibility of including additional FM file applications in subsequent phases. The work requested in this phase includes the document preparation, scanning, indexing and development of all applications and systems necessary to provide a customized workflow and indexing application to support the aforementioned files on MMS' existing Global 360?, (formerly ViewStar?) system.  This system will contain both active and terminated lease and agreement files, along with other files containing a variety of document types.  This system will provide the capability to scan, index, retrieve and archive these records. Existing lease, agreement and correspondence paper and microfiche files must be prepared and then scanned, indexed and quality checked.  Concurrent with the conversion of pre-existing files all new incoming lease, agreement, correspondence and deposit ticket records must be scanned, indexed, quality checked and routed to a Minerals Revenue Management (MRM) Analyst.  Scanning and indexing of new records will occur on-site. Agency Background MMS/MRM is an agency of the U.S. Government under the Department of the Interior (DOI). Its mission is to collect, account for, and disburse funds collected from private industry and other governmental agencies.  In so doing, the MMS/MRM manages extensive information systems covering historical property and fiscal data. A great deal of information is generated in historical record archiving of physical file folders through document image scanning. Magnitude of Work Scan and Index all existing MRM 'Federal Records' and backlog of 'Indian Records' from November 1, 2004 to present.    Objectives These are the overall Project Objectives.  They are provided for background information/understanding.  All aspects of the SOW contribute to attaining these objectives. "	Support the Agency to fulfill its mission;  "	Achieve goal of physical record archiving by providing an electronic filing capability; "	Scan and index 90,000 physical folders containing documents and microfiche images, totaling approximately 500,000 pages and 250,000 microfiche images.

Benefits Imaging provides the following benefits: "	Improved retention of all record material "	Customer needs "	Easy retrieval and access to documentation for financial files, including on-site and off-site retrieval, by telecommuters and others "	Reduce/Eliminate lost or misfiled documents "	Reduce processing time "	Leases and Agreements are complex and oil and gas analysts rely entirely on the information contained in these files as well as other documentation.  No automated system currently contains this data. "	Reduce paper copies (Paperwork Reduction Act - USC Title 44, Chapter 35, 3504 http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/laws/paperwork-reduction/3504.html) "	Improved security control over all documents "	Increased productivity "	Can be expanded to include additional file types throughout FM "	Save costs on storage, retrieval and maintenance of hard copy files "	Meets organizational goal to expand electronic document scanning and retrieval "	A necessary step to implement automated workflow processes throughout the organization Period of Performance This section identifies the general period of performance for this proposal.

It is required that the Sig Sauer P229 Pistol be purchased to issue to the agents who will be assigned to overseas Posts.  The above weapons will be used to replace the Department of State weapons destroyed in accordance with the Federal Property Management regulation.  This will enable the agents to provide continued protection and security for personnel. Additionally, continued safe travel and protected movement is required for high level U.S. Embassy and Consulate officials while traveling overseas, and for Ambassador level officials serving in international organizations working to restore and maintain economic and social stability. Sig Sauer P229 9mm pistol is the issued pistol that all agents are trained on.  Overall length: 7.1 inches, Overall height: 5.4 inches, Overall width: 1.5 inches, Barrel length: 3.9 inches, Weight w/o mag: 28.1 oz, Mag weight: 3.0 oz, Sight radius: 5.7 inches.  State Department requires the Law Enforcement magazine which holds 13 rounds as opposed to 10 rounds and DS also requires the Trijicon night sights.   Under the Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986, the Bureau of Diplomatic Security has a broad range of responsibilities that include the protection of personnel and facilities, both domestic and abroad.  Without the weapons requested, the Diplomatic Security Service will be unable to provide the proper level of security and protection.  The Sig Sauer P229 9mm pistol is a unique system that our armorers have been certified to repair, and that the agents have been trained to use.  All agents must be able to pick up a weapon and use it, not just the one they were trained on, and this becomes a legal liability issue.  The U.S. Department of State cannot utilize multiple systems for our weapons for the above reasons. The weapons requested are what the agents were trained to use during their initial training as Diplomatic Security Service Special Agent Training.  The economic impact to the U.S. Government for using other items than what is requested, would be great and would involve the re-training of all agents in the field including purchasing all new weapons systems to issue to the various mission locations be it overseas or abroad.  Sig Sauer is the manufacturer of the P229 Pistol. The DS Firearms Policy and Review Board (FPRB) has approved the use of the Sig Sauer as the ONLY pistol authorized for use by DS Agents.

Complex Models to Estimate Mortalities in Small Domains with 30+ Years’ of NCHS Data 
				Requisition 

					
I.	BACKGROUND 

The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) publishes complete sex and race specific national life tables annually and national and State specific complete life tables decennially. In addition, decennial “causes of death” life tables are also published with updated ICD codes. NCHS is interested in improving methodologies for generating decennial tables. Methodologies for generating annual life tables are usually revised and updated respecting decennial life tables and then kept consistent for about 10 years until the next decennial life tables’ methodology is updated. For decennial life tables 1999-2001, a major attempt is being made to overcome difficulties in estimating mortality in small domains (small states, some causes of death), so that life tables can be published with reliability. To fulfill this goal, research has been focused on methods for smoothing observed death data in small subpopulations by “borrowing” strengths from other data sources and sophisticated statistical models. A previous contract study successfully established a semiparametric time series model for estimating age-specific mortality by utilizing NCHS 30 years’ mortality data. Another recent study showed that the absence of deaths in some small domains are due to extremely low mortality rates and small populations, and therefore should be treated as “zero” rather than “missing” data. These “zero” values should contribute to the calculation of an average of neighborhood (time and/or age) mortality. The concept of “missing” for insufficient death observations used in previous applications leads to overestimation of mortality rates. To correct this problem, it is proposed to establish some proper probability model for estimating extremely low mortality rates with time series analysis.  It is also necessary to develop the corresponding algorithm in concept of maximum likelihood for estimating practices. To optimize estimating results, several sophisticated methods, including Bayesian method, two-dimensional Kriging smoothing and semi-likelihood estimation, will be applied and compared. The result from this research is expected to significantly improve reliability and utility of NCHS decennial life tables.     

II.  PURPOSE

1)  Establish an estimating model for mortality rates for domains with “zero” death observations based on the probability theory and neighborhood observations in a 2-dimensional window space (year x age);

2)  Compare the classical maximum likelihood algorithm for mortality estimates with other alternatives or modifications, such as trans-Gaussian kriging, Bayesian transformed Gaussian, semi-likelihood estimation, etc.;

3)  Evaluate proposed estimation methodology with NCHS mortality data from small domains such as “small states” and “rarer causes of death”;

4)  Assist in preparing specifications for use in applications at NCHS.


III . SCOPE OF WORK

  The vendor will provide all labor, materials and equipment required to complete the tasks outlined below. Vendor will deliver to Project Officer quarterly summaries of progress and problems. The vendor maybe required to travel an estimate of 2 trips to or communications with NCHS, (Hyattsville, MD) to obtain background information on the project.
  All documentation and software will be developed for IBM PC and PC compatible computers operating on a Windows XP Professional platform.  Source and executable code and technical and user documentation will be provided to NCHS.  Vendor will make interim software developed during the research available to NCHS in preliminary form to continue the research with sufficient instruction in its use to enable its use by NCHS and federal colleagues.
Vendor will not have access to confidential NCHS data.  Research will not involve testing human subjects.  Research directions and goals will be set by project officer.

IV.  TASKS TO BE PERFORMED

1)  Vendor will conduct a literature review to solidify the study base, report literature review on estimation models and corresponding algorithms related to the subject, and provide a summary and comments for reviewed methodologies;
2)  Vendor will develop probability models and corresponding algorithms for estimating extremely low mortalities in small domains;
3)  Vendor will adapt several alternative estimating methods to different types of life tables (e.g. complete vs. abridged life tables, decennial vs. annual tables);
4)  Vendor will assess and compare proposed models and algorithms using NCHS mortality data;
5)  Vendor will attendan estimate of 8 -10 work group meetings periodically to update study progresses;
6)  Vendor will prepare quarterly and final reports;
7)  Vendor will assist senior NCHS program personnel to  prepareapproximatley 1-2 research papers suitable for publication in peer reviewed journals.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number for this procurement is F2ETZ36213A400 and this is a Request For Quotation (RFQ).     This announcement will be issued as a combined synopsis/solicitation. The anticipated award will be a Firm Fixed Price Contract, the award will be made based on the Best Value to the Government.     The delivery time will be no more then 60 days after award.  The solicitation shall incorporate provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-09.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334515. The SB size standard for this code is 500 employees. ITEM DESCRIPTION: CLIN 0001: QTY: 1 ea Sypris Data Systems’ Model 670-601 Frequency Converter accepts a 16 MHz bandwidth signal centered at 8 MHz. The Frequency Converter is typically used with an analog signal recorder. The 16 MHz ± 8 MHz analog signal is recorded and later played back or equal.  The Model 670-601 performs frequency shifting using a completely digital implementation to eliminate the effects of varying phase shift that occur in analog mixer converters. The input signal is sampled and converted to digital data by a 14 bit A/D converter to maintain very high dynamic signal range. The digital data samples are mathematically shifted to the required 8 MHz center frequency then reconverted to an analog signal for connection to the signal recorder. An identical process is used to shift the recorded signal to the output center frequency.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation/reference number is F3Z0366213A600; this solicitation is a request for quotation.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-11 and Defense DCN 20060711.  This acquisition will be a 100% small business set-aside; the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 443112.  The business size standard is $8 Million Dollars.  The Federal Supply Class (FSC) is 7720.  The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) is 5731.  This request for quotation consists of the following items:  Item 0001: 4 EA – Meyer Sound 700HP High Powered Subwoofer.  0002:  2 EA – Meyer Sound 27.137.016.01 Soft Cover to Cover HP-700 Subwoofers.  0003:  2 EA – Shure P7TR35-PSM 700 System, includes P7T P7R and E5 Earphones.  0004:  2 EA – Meyer Sound 40.137.002.01 MCF-700 Caster Board for HP-700.  0005:  2 EA – Meyer Sound UM-1P narrow Coverage Stage Monitor 45 Degree Pattern.  0006:  3 EA – R & R Custom Concert Band stand light/plexi case (3 case set).  0007:  2 EA – Meyer Sound 40.115.100.01 MD-1D Multi-Purpose Grid.  0008:  4 EA – Meyer Sound M2D Compact Curvilinear Aray Loudspeaker.  0009:  6 EA – Furman PL-Plus D II Enhanced Power Conditioner.  Items must be delivered to: 551 Waldron St. Bldg 240, Travis AFB, CA. 94535.  Items must be the above brand names, no “or equal” products will be accepted.  The following is the approved Brand Name Justification:

1. Requiring Authority:  AMC/BA-T; MSgt Michael Goetz, 707-424-1158

2. Description of Requirement:  Audio Replacement Equipment

3. Statutory Authority permitting other than full and open competition:  Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, as implemented by: FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement.

4. Justification or Authority for action:
	A. R&R Cases and Meyer are essential professional brand names and a brand name requirement for the USAF Band of the Golden West.  The listed items and corresponding model numbers are compatible with existing equipment.  For example, our power distribution box and other connections are already setup to handle the Mackie items.  Also, the USAF Band of the Golden West already has all the proper connectors required to use Mackie and Meyer.  We currently have remaining Mackie, Meyer and R&R equipment items and we require to match the existing style and function of our existing equipment.  In some instances, we link the Mackie boards together and this is not possible with other brands of lesser quality.   These items are self- powered and therefore, don’t require additional amplifiers or processors to function correctly.  The size-to-power ratio is also greatly increased from other items and don’t produce the same quality sound required to represent the United States Air Force for highly prolific jobs  to include events of the highest caliber including performances for the President of the United States.   Other factors to consider with the requested brand names are as follows:
·	Meyer powered speakers allow for maximum flexability of placement at all venues
·	Amp and control electronics are built in to the speakers unlike other manufacturers.
·	We have owned Meyer for many years with proven road reliability and durability.  Other products have failed and required quicker replacement/maintenance.
·	The size / weight of Meyer equipment greatly reduces our load in/out time and with the future of the band downsizing, maximum efficiency is optimal
·	Meyer has developed proven proprietary technology that other manufacturer have not developed….to include the transducers, amplification and control electronics of all Meyer self-powered speakers are created as a symbiotic system that optimizes performance and maximizes power, power connections for existing power distribution are already in place for Meyer equipment only. (replacement cost for changing all power Distro equipment)
·	Meyer loudspeakers are designed to work at optimum efficiency with other Meyer equipment we already own
·	Meyer equipment has more options available than any other company
·	Meyer equipment undergoes rigorous test procedures to insure the absolute highest quality.
·	All Meyer loudspeakers are designed with Optional QuickFly® rigging kits available, with aluminum and steel side rigging bars, AlignaLinks and quick release pins.  Items we already own.
   
	B. These items are to replace items that were lost in the truck fire and they will be used with existing audio materials of the same brand name.  In many performances, speakers are stacked on top of one another.  The size of new and old speakers must be uniform if they are to be stacked on top of one another.  This will reduce safety hazards by having uniformity with all the speakers instead of having different size speakers that aren’t designed to stack on top of one another.
	C. The band is currently scheduled to perform on 29 September at the “Battle of Britian”.  Rehearsals happening before that date also require this equipment.  Not having the required equipment will severely limit our musical abilities may compromise this unit’s  mission.
	D. The equipment required is available from different vendors. The following vendors have been contacted and can provide the equipment specified.

    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of Public Law 107–296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held— 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107–296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. 
    (f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that {Check one}:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  
The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

1.0 - Introduction: 

In order to maintain the safety and reliability of the armored USAID/DCHA/OFDA fleet in the field, it is necessary to periodically replace the wearable vehicle parts. The run-flat systems that are currently installed on the armored Toyota Land Cruiser positioned in South Africa are compromising the safety and reliability of the vehicle. 
 
The capability of the United States Government (USG) to quickly and safely respond to international emergencies is dependent on the reliability of the field fleet. To ensure that these vehicles are ready at all times, it is necessary to replace those parts which serve to compromise the integrity and safety of the vehicle armor system. Run-flat tires represent a portion of this system. The run-flat tires currently installed on this vehicle have had multiple problems in the recent past. To prevent these problems from re-occurring during an emergency situation, five replacement run-flat systems need to be acquired for this vehicle (one for each tire and one for the spare).


2.0 - Technical Requirements and Specifications:

This procurement will be for five new, unused run-flat tire systems to be installed on an armored Toyota Land Cruiser.  In accordance with the following specifications:  

  Five standard 16” run-flat replacements with wheel profiles:
  B1170 (16 x 6.5 steel wheel), including inserts and metal valve
  stems. These replacements need to be compatible with either
  275/70 R16 or 235/85 R16 tires. 

The authorized source, origin and nationality for this procurement is geographic code 000, United States of America.


3.0 - Delivery:

Delivery of the Run Flat system will take place immediately upon award, but not later than September 1st, 2006.  The contractor will be required to provide ODFA Logistics with weight, dimensions, and specifications of the cargo (individual carton and palletized) prior to shipment from vendor’s warehouse, after packaged for transport.  

Delivery shall be made at the Contractor’s premises, in accordance with FAR 52.247-30, F.O.B. Origin, Contractor’s Facility


4.0 – Inspection and Acceptance:

Inspection and acceptance will take place at the Contractor’s facilities, in accordance with FAR 52.246 4 INSPECTION OF SERVICES   FIXED PRICE (AUG 1996).

Inspection and acceptance of all deliverables required hereunder shall be performed by the cognizant USAID CTO for this Purchase Order or his/her designee.


5.0 - Marking requirement:
  
Marking shall be in accordance with clause AIDAR 752.7009 Marking (JAN 1993).

The bridge shall consist of open "pony truss" design fabricated for "H" or "HS" AASHTO loading.  All members of the vertical trusses (top and bottom chords, verticals, and diagonals) shall be fabricated from structural steel tubing.  The structural design of the bridge superstructure shall be performed by or under the supervision of a licensed professional engineer in accordance with the requirement of the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC).  Structural tubing members and their connections shall be designed according to the AISC "Hollow Structural Section Connections Manual", latest edition.  The bridge manufacturer shall be certified by the AISC to fabricate Major Steel Bridge Structures.

The NPS shall be responsible for unloading the bridge from the truck at the time of arrival. The supplier shall notify the NPS 6 days in advance of the expected time of arrival.  Upon award, the manufacturer shall provide drawings for the two reinforced concrete abutments.  The NPS shall construct the abutments prior to delivery of the bridge superstructure and timber decking materials.  The location of the abutments is on existing undisturbed road bed.  The manufacturer shall provide a construction advisor for two days to assist the NPS in the installation and assembly of the bridge. This advisor must be present on a daily basis to ensure that the bridge is installed/erected properly.  DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:  The bridge shall be designed for dead load plus AASHTO HS20-44 live (truck) loading and for wind load of 40 pounds per square foot, calculated with wind acting on entire bridge vertical face as if it we fully enclosed.

Wood decking material shall be normal 6" X 14" No. 1 grade West Coast Douglas Fir, treated with Copper Naphthenate to above ground conditions according to the American Wood Preserves Association.  Prior to treatment of timbers, manufacturer shall shape/cut timbers to exact length and drill holes as needed to receive required bolts, so treatment will penetrate all exposed surfaces.  The following guidelines shall be used when treating material: 1) Treat using Copper Naphthenate which meets AWPA P8, Section 2.  The solvent used shall meet the requirements of AWPA Standard P9, Hydrocarbon solvent, Type A or Type C, depending on the product being treated.  2)  Solution Filtration - The Copper Napthenate solution in use shall be filtered or otherwise kept clean regularly to remove solids which may otherwise be deposited on the wood during treating.  3)  Follow good housekeeping practices to minimize sawdust and other surface residues on the wood products prior to treatment.  4)  Expansion Bath - Use a minimum expansion bath of one hour.  The maximum temperature of the expansion bath shall be 220 degrees F or 230 degrees F depending on the specific commodity standard limitations.  The expansion bath shall be followed by a vacuum period using a minimum of 22" for a minimum for a minimum of two hours. Following the vacuum period, the wood shall be subjected to steaming for a two-hour time period.  The minimum temperature during steaming shall be 200 degrees F and the maximum shall be 240 degrees F depending on the species being treated.  After steaming, apply a final vacuum for a minimum of four hours at 22" of vacuum.  Prior to shipment, visually inspect the treated wood product and reject any pieces with excessive surface residue. Note, however, that an oil carrier may be detected in a surface wipe of a properly treated and acceptable product.  Avoid excessive solids or grease-like deposits which can be scraped off the surface.  Also, reject material where liquid preservative "bleeds" from the product.  The NPS shall install the wood decking material according to the manufacturer's drawings.  The 5-inch continuous steel channel toe plate provided by the manufacturer shall be mounted inside each truss 4 inches above the deck according to the manufacturer's drawings.

<DESC>*  THIS RESPONSE IS DUE BY 10:00 AM ON 29 AUGUST 2006 *

Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Procurement and Grants Office (Atlanta), 2920 Brandywine Road, Room 3000, Atlanta, GA, 30341-4146

       The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is seeking potential offerors who have the capabilities of procuring Opportunistic Infection Drugs (OI) and Home Based Care Drugs & Products within and for Vietnam; this is a Request for Quotation for providing these services and products.     The Government intends to award an Unpriced Firm Fixed-Price Purchase Order that will consist of a 6 month base period with four six month option period.     The offerors will be required to undertake the product procurement through an open quotation system.     The products are procured on open bid, with a minimum of three quotations required for each product.     The product with the lowest cost, which can meet all of the specifications and quality requirement, is then procured. Included in this description is a sample list of OI Drugs that may be required to be purchased under the purchase order.
       
       Each offeror MUST submit ALL required certifications showing proof of meeting the government's requirements with their quotation, which are listed here:

       *  Under Vietnam law and regulation only a registered and licensed pharmaceutical distributor may undertake physical distribution of pharmaceutical products. Additionally, PEPFAR Vietnam is currently operating in 40 provinces of Vietnam with a wide geographical range from the far Northern area to the far Southern area of the country; a longitudinal spread of around 2,000 Kms.     The contractor must be able to operate over a wide geographical range.  
       
       *  The volume of medicines to be provided by PEPFAR, although small in comparison to the total country requirement, is nevertheless a significant proportion in relation to the central level public sector supply. Therefore the contractor must currently have high capacity volume capabilities and have adequate capacity to store and undertake the physical distribution volumes of medicines required by PEPFAR Vietnam.

       *  Because a number of treatment sites have very low storage capacity for medicines, it is a requirement that the contractor store medicines and undertake frequent small deliveries to the treatment sites. Further, storage is required to hold emergency stocks and buffer stocks against possible unforeseen circumstances and erratic usage patterns.

       *  It is a Ministry of Health (MoH) requirement, {Extraordinary Letter No. 6036/QLD-CL Ministry of Health, Drug Administration of Vietnam, Attention: Pharmaceutical Companies, enterprises attaining Good Practices (GPs)} that all new operations, must use only storage facilities that have ASEAN (Association of South-East Asian Nations) GSP (Good Storage Practice) certification.

      *  It is a MoH and MoF requirement that all proposed medicine distribution must be approved in advance by both Ministries.

      *  All offerors who are to procure, store and distribute medicines destined for use within the public sector of Vietnam must have within their possession/on file specific approval for each activity from both the MoH and MoF.

The Request for Quotations for this solicitation along with all proof of certification requirements MUST be emailed by electronic mail to egz2@cdc.gov (FIRST PREFERENCE) OR (IF YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO EMAIL) by mail delivered to: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), mail Stop, K75 Attn: John Ebanks, Contract Specialist, 2920 Brandywine Rd, Atlanta, GA 30341-5539.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/request for quote (RFQ) for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  DHQCSD06MPA0029 is the Request For Quotation Number.  The RFQ and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Far Part 12.3.  The NAICS code is 561790.  This is a total small business set aside.  CLIN 0001; Services, Non-personal for snow removal services for the period of 4 Sep 06 through 3 Sep 07, as a firm fixed price type contract being billed per snow removal.

CLIN 4001; Services, Non-personal for snow removal services for the period of 4 Sep 10 – 3 Sep 11.  CLINs 1001-4001 will be option years for the contract.  Please provide a price quote for the base and option years.  Provide a cost per each snow removal and a cost for 10 snow removals per year.  REQUIREMENT:  Description of Services:  The Contractor shall provide on-call snow removal services for the extended parking lot and loading dock areas surrounding building X, see sites-place of performance below, including all minor access roads on the grounds.  The total area of the parking area is approximately 233,000 ft2.  Services are expected to occur for approximately eight (8) months of the year during any year of contract performance.  The parking lot is insufficiently graded to allow complete draining of melting snow and ice, and requires managed attention after most snowfalls or during high wind periods when excessive snow is blown in from adjacent prairie areas.  When allowed to collect, pack, and refreeze, numerous puddles are created that present black ice conditions.  The Contractor shall respond within two (2) hours of a request for service during operational hours (0500-2200 Monday-Friday) and within four (4) hours during reduced manning hours (2200-0500 Monday-Friday and on weekends and Federal holidays) with equipment appropriate to manage the required snow removal service(s).  Services shall include plowing and snow removal to the outer edges of the parking and service areas, scraping to remove packed snow conditions in thoroughfares, and snow-melt services for the asphalt area.  Snow-melt shall be accomplished using substances that are approved for use in the State of Utah and on Hill Air Force Base.  The Contractor shall expect that the parking lot will always have some vehicles parked in it due to the 24x7 operations at the facility, and can coordinate with the visitor desk at building X for necessary consolidation when required.  The Government recognizes that some vehicles may be unable to be moved during any snow removal cycle due to internal facility work requirements.  Any damage to the facility (including damage to curbs and signage) incurred by the Contractor during a service shall be repaired by the Contractor at the Contractor’s expense.  DISA personnel authorized to call for snow removal services are limited to the site Facility Managers (primary and secondary contract POCs, below), Gayle Eatchel (site Acquisitions Manager, 801.605.7416), and swing shift supervisors (names to be provided by site POCs after contract award).  Primary Point of Contact: Paul Johnson, Site Facility Manager 801.605.7441 or paul.johnson@csd.disa.mil.  Secondary Point of Contact:  Ralph Pettit, Alternate Site Facility Manager 801.605.7442 or ralph.pettit@csd.disa.mil.  The Contractor is NOT required to anticipate the need for snow removal services, and shall NOT conduct services without an authorized call from the DISA site, as noted above.  Some snowfall conditions (where the snow is anticipated to entirely sublimate by noon, for example) may present a reason for the Government not to call the Contractor for services.  In other situations (ongoing snowstorm with high winds) the Contractor may be called more than once in a day; the Government will pay individually for each service rendered, rather than on a daily or other time-based period.  Government & Contractor Furnished Facilities, Supplies, & Services:  The Contractor shall supply all labor, transportation, material, apparatus, tools, and permits necessary to accomplish all tasks described in Section 1.  Sites – Place of Performance:  The Place of Performance data is considered Sensitive and is For Official Use Only (FOUO).  This information should not be released to the public through the Commerce Business Daily (CBD) or through other public sources.  Announcements to public sources for bidding shall relate only the installation, city, and state where the performance of the contract is to take place.  Complete place of performance information shall be released by the Contracting Officer to the winning bidder when the contract is awarded.  Place of Performance is Hill AFB, Ogden, UT  84056.  The Contractor shall provide his own access to the host installation (Hill AFB); DISA is not manned to provide escorts to enable Contractor personnel and vehicles to enter the installation in any circumstance.  Hours of Operation:  Snow removal shall occur at other-than-core-hours (0700-1630, Monday-Friday) unless otherwise ordered by the site Facility Manager, in order to reduce the number of vehicles in the parking area during performance of services.  Service requests can occur any day of the year.  This Agreement shall have a Period of Performance (POP) consisting of one (1) base year and four (4) option years.  Security:  The work to be accomplished in this contract is unclassified.  LOCAL SAFETY REQUIREMENTS:  The Contractor shall comply with all local safety requirements implemented at the installation where the work is to be accomplished provided that they do not conflict with the requirements of this Section.  If conflicts arise, they shall be referred to the PCO for resolution.  Subcontractors - The Contractor shall include a clause in all subcontractor agreements to comply with the safety provisions of this contract as applicable.  Accident/Incident Reporting and Investigations:  The Contractor shall record and submit promptly to the Facility Manager all available facts relating to each instance of or accidental damage to Government property or injury to either Government or Contractor personnel.  The Contractor shall not perform any work on the damaged equipment/property until released by an authorized Government representative.  If the Government elects to conduct an investigation of the accident, the Contractor shall cooperate fully and assist the Government personnel until the investigation is completed.

DEFENSE DEPOT PEARL HARBOR, HAWAII (DDPH)

INSTALLATION OF BIRD NETTING TO PROVIDE AN AVIAN FREE AREA, BLDG 1900 

SCOPE OF WORK (SOW)


	Work is to consist of all parts, labor, equipment, material, travel, and insurance to install heavy duty ¾” bird netting in and around the existing open-sided building number 1900, located at Defense Depot Pearl Harbor (DDPH), Pearl Harbor Naval Facility, Pearl, Harbor, Hawaii, to keep any birds out of this facility.  The areas included are the interior ceiling in the warehouse section, the exterior overhangs, and from the ceiling down along two exterior walls.  The hardware used to fasten the bird netting (steel cable, beam clamps, turnbuckles, etc.) shall be stainless steel due to the location by salt water.  The area, including the sidewalls, is approximately 60,000-65,000 SF, and the building is roughly 320’ x 175’, and is 19’ from the floor to bottom of the interior overhead lights.  Access is to be provided at those areas designated as requiring it, such as overhead lighting fixtures, sprinkler valves, etc., for ease of maintenance and emergencies.  Since the area is not a basic rectangular shape and conditions might vary for the specified work areas to be done, site visits are recommended to confirm the current conditions, locations, and quantity of the work required, and any other unforeseen site conditions.  All work is to meet industry standards and guidelines, and have as a minimum 3 year warranty on the product and workmanship.   Contractor shall identify the brand name or manufacturer of the type of bird netting being proposed with their offer.

<CONTACT>Rachael Houle, Contract Specialist, (973)724-2197
<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial item prepared in  accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with  additional information included in this notice. The United States Army Tank- automotive and Armaments Command â€“ Picatinny Arsenal TACOM-Picatinny),  Picatinny Center for Contracting and Commerce (PC3) intends to solicit,  negotiate and award a Purchase Order for one (1) commercial off-the-shelf  Automatic Image Target Measurement System (AITMS).  The AITMS is an innovative  system that integrates video-graphic hardware, pictorial format, and software  programming to capture, transmit, evaluate, display, and store target  dispersion data digitally during real time ballistic testing.  AITMS will be  used to evaluate target accuracy which is generated by firing 40mm or smaller  projectiles into a target scoring paper in an indoor or outdoor environment.  AITMS shall run on a PC with Microsoft Windows XP Operating System Platform and  be able to save, open, and import files in video (CIN, AVI, MPEG) and image  format (JPEG, GIF, TIFF).  The system must be able to capture live video images  at a minimum rate of 30 frames per second and be able to record each new bullet  hole on target while fires at a burst cyclic rate higher than 1,500 rounds per  minute. AITMS is also able to automatically scan, identify, and calculate each  bullet impact on target in a sequential order. The system should show an  indicator (cursor or dot) graphically in the target picture to identifying each  shot holeâ€™s center.  The coordinate system that the target accuracy results  based on is determined by the vertical line through the center of the left most  shot hole represents the vertical reference axis and the horizontal line  through the center of the bottom-most shot hole represents the horizontal  reference axis. User can edit/amend or overwrite any questionable shot holeâ€™s  xy value that was generated by the software program; such as during extremely  tight target pattern (mean radius of less than .5 inches), in which bullet  holes on target might partially or totally overlapped, under this circumstance,  user can manually select a method, such as by clicking the mouse on center of  the shot hole, with user best judgment, to replace the xy value that was  generated by the AITMS program. Under the condition that user concerns the  target accuracy results relative to an Aim Point. The Aim Point defines as the  supposed impact location of the firing bullet in the target. The Aim Point can  be determined by a laser device light beam spotting on the target in which the  laser device was inserted into the weapon barrel. The system must provide both  the xy value of the Aim Point and the distance from the Aim Point to the center  of impact of the overall shot holesâ€™. The final target accuracy results format  should match US Armyâ€™s Small Caliber Ammunition Test Procedures 5.56mm  Cartridges Revision A., Feb 12th, 1993 version, Section 3.4. Results should  include the followings: (1) Extreme Vertical (defines as: vertical distance  between the center of the hole made by uppermost shot and the center of the  hole made by the lowermost shot); (2) Extreme Horizontal (defined as:  Horizontal distance between the center of the hole made by the shot farthest to  the right and the center of the hole made by the shot farthest to the left);  (3) Extreme Spread (defines as: distance between centers of the shot holes  farthest apart); (4) x, y coordinate value; (5) Center of Impact (defined as  the point at which the algebraic sums of the vertical and horizontal components  respectively of the distances to the center of each shot hole are zero); (6)  Mean Radius (defines as: from the center of impact, measures the distance to  the center of each shot hole of the target.

In order to achieve its DoD mission of tracking malpractice and other Federal data for comparison with DoD statistics, the Department maintains sharing agreements with several Federal entities, to include the Navy Recruiting  Command, the United States Coast Guard, and the United States Department of Justice.  Through its critical role as an information clearinghouse, the Department of Legal Medicine tracks and reports on malpractice and quality assurance parameters both withi n and outside DoD, in order that DoD can identify high risk areas and target remedial efforts in military hospitals throughout DoD. Objectives: The Department of Legal Medicine expects timely and ac curate malpractice and credentials data extraction and analysis, along with suggested remedial measures to target high risk areas of health care presented in both a printed and an electronic medium and distributed worldwide to all DoD active duty military and civilian health care providers. Scope: The contractor will engage in an ongoing surveillance of all incoming DoD medical malpractice claims from all three military services and provide monthly reports on specified parameters utilizing required software (i.e., IQRS, QPRAC and SPSS).

The Monthly Report:  There will be a 100% review of every monthly report including timeliness and accuracy of the report. Analysis of the Data:  Month ly review of the validity of the statistical analysis in each monthly report will be performed on 100% of the data produced in each monthly report. Credentials Review:  There will be a weekly review of the accuracy and timeliness (within 30 days) of all provider credential files, including demographic information, educational information, residency training, fellowship training, licenses, certificates  and board examinations.  A 100% review will occur during the first 4 months.  After this period a random review will be substituted on a monthly basis for accuracy and timeliness.  Customer input will also be used as an important element of the method of surveillance for this task.  On a monthly basis contact will be made with the customers who receive the credentials files in order to evaluate any concerns on their part concerning the performance of the contractor in producing the complete, timely, practi tioner portfolios. Continuing Medical Education:  A 100% review on an annual basis of the Legal Medicine Journal for content, quiz and answers, and distribution list review will be performed to ensure the highest quality of quality assurance and risk management education for  the military health system.  Customer input will also be evaluated using an analysis of the evaluation form contained in each issue of Legal Medicine.  Additionally contact with the military services, DoD Health Affairs, and the TriCare Management activit y will be used to gauge the quality of each issue as it is produced by the contractor.

It is required that the Sig Sauer P229 Pistol be purchased to issue to the agents who will be assigned to overseas Posts.  The above weapons will be used to replace the Department of State weapons destroyed in accordance with the Federal Property Management regulation.  This will enable the agents to provide continued protection and security for personnel. Additionally, continued safe travel and protected movement is required for high level U.S. Embassy and Consulate officials while traveling overseas, and for Ambassador level officials serving in international organizations working to restore and maintain economic and social stability. Sig Sauer P229 9mm pistol is the issued pistol that all agents are trained on.  Overall length: 7.1 inches, Overall height: 5.4 inches, Overall width: 1.5 inches, Barrel length: 3.9 inches, Weight w/o mag: 28.1 oz, Mag weight: 3.0 oz, Sight radius: 5.7 inches.  State Department requires the Law Enforcement magazine which holds 13 rounds as opposed to 10 rounds and DS also requires the Trijicon night sights.   Under the Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986, the Bureau of Diplomatic Security has a broad range of responsibilities that include the protection of personnel and facilities, both domestic and abroad.  Without the weapons requested, the Diplomatic Security Service will be unable to provide the proper level of security and protection.  The Sig Sauer P229 9mm pistol is a unique system that our armorers have been certified to repair, and that the agents have been trained to use.  All agents must be able to pick up a weapon and use it, not just the one they were trained on, and this becomes a legal liability issue.  The U.S. Department of State cannot utilize multiple systems for our weapons for the above reasons. The weapons requested are what the agents were trained to use during their initial training as Diplomatic Security Service Special Agent Training.  The economic impact to the U.S. Government for using other items than what is requested, would be great and would involve the re-training of all agents in the field including purchasing all new weapons systems to issue to the various mission locations be it overseas or abroad.  Sig Sauer is the manufacturer of the P229 Pistol. The DS Firearms Policy and Review Board (FPRB) has approved the use of the Sig Sauer as the ONLY pistol authorized for use by DS Agents.

<DESC>Amendment - Learning Management System (LMS) 

Solicitation HQ0423-06-T-0007 - Questions and Answers 
1-Q- What is the award timeframe?  
1-A-The award will be, by the first week of September.
2- Q-How will you differentiate vendors, based solely upon price?  
2-A-This is a Best Value acquisition, see evaluation criteria.
3-Q-Will there be a required product demonstration to show the ability to meet the requirements?
3-A-No product demonstration will be required.  Award will be based on information that is provided in the proposal.

The next questions references The Statement of Work Section C3.1, provided via eMail:   
4-Q- #3, It states that the system will allow for multiple sessions- is this concurrent users or multiple events of a class?
 4-A- The system should support multiple instances of the same class with multiple users concurrently e.g. Course DPAS101 Section 1 with 25 students and instructor A is active and separate from course DPAS101 Section 2 with 25 students and instructor B during the same time period.
5- Q-#4, Functionality for progress tracking- this could be many things, are you able to explain further, like progress shown in a transcript or progress shown while in an online course or progress shown by allocating attendance or credit?
 5-A-  The student transcript should show courses attempted and completed with passed or failed notation (credit). A student should be able to see his progress through the modules of an active course.
6- Q- #5 Provide certification of training skills- how should this be done, through a transcript, a printable certificate or by a manager allocation?
 6-A- The student transcript should maintain course success/credit/certification history. The student should be able to print their own certificate after successfully completing a course.
7- Q- #10 Support multiple applications, can you describe what is currently being used, like captivate, articulate, breeze, webinars, flash?
 7-A- Content is being developed in Dreamweaver, Captivate, Contribute, PowerPoint, Microsoft Producer, audio and video files, along with documents in Microsoft Word, Adobe Acrobat Reader, Fireworks and Flash. The content items will be html, doc, pdf, xls, gif, .swf, and jpg with JavaScript, Java, and Action script. 
8- Q- #17, It is assumed that not all of the 5000 employees will be activated; some may be inactive and never use the system but would be in the user profiles? 
 8-A- Over the life of the system as users rotate we will need to keep their historical account/user profiles. These could eventually exceed 5000 accounts/user profiles.  Not every user would ever access the courseware.  No more than 5000 would be active concurrently and the expectation is that the number would be less than that.
 9- Q-Is support for MS SQL Server 2003 a mandatory requirement or can another Database product (MS SQL Server 2000, Oracle 10g, IBM DB2) be offered?
 9-A-Database needs to be Microsoft SQL Server 2003 or later version; all our servers have 2003 loaded on them.

1.0 BACKGROUND:  The mission of the Defense Finance & Accounting Services Rome is to produce timely and accurate disbursements to the Department of Defense personnel, their dependants and commercial concerns. Automation support varies with in each directorate at all DFAS sites, but every function depends heavily upon telecommunications services to respond to customer needs.  DFAS needs to provide better customer service while reducing costs by upgrading the Nortel 61C Public Branch Exchange (PBX) at Rome.  Currently telephony support is provided by the Air Force Research Lab, Rome Research Site (AFRL). The Rome Labs Director has determined that they no longer desire to support DFAS Rome.  This means that DFAS Rome requires its own PBX for telephony support.

Rome’s population will increase by 436 more personnel due to BRAC realignment.  The Nortel 61C PBX is currently not a fully functional PBX. The current DFAS PBX is a fiber remote off of the AFRL PBX.  The Nortel 61C PBX was shipped from San Bernardino to DAFS Rome.  The contractor will provide equipment, software, and such technical support and training needed to install and implement the upgrade of the DFAS San Bernardino Nortel PBX to version 4.5 with Call Pilot, Symposium Express, DSN, and IP trunking.  The contractor will upgrade the frame relay room to required specifications needed to support the total population of DFAS Rome.  The battery backup and rectifier will need to be replaced.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide further clarification on questions from prospective offerors and extend the date and time for receipt of quotes to August 17, 2006 at 4:00 p.m.  Questions and Responses are as follows:
 
 
1.  Regarding the Mask:  The part numbers listed, #10007422, #10007423 #10007424 refer to discontinued numbers for the masks AND one canister.  The new numbers for Millenium Mask ONLY are #10051286, #10051287 and #10051288.
Response:  We were not aware that the mask numbers identified have been discontinued.  New Part #’s are: 
Millennium mask – Size small – part # 10051286, Canister – Part # 10057496. Millennium mask – Size medium – part # 10051287, Canister – Part # 10057496. Millennium mask – Size Large – part # 10051288, Canister – Part # 10057496. 
 
2.  Regarding the Canisters:  Question 5 of Amendment 1 states that CBRN is not required due to Training Environment Only.  So I would recommend MSA training cartridge, #10057496.  These come 20/case, so it would be up to each offeror to determine how many cases in order to fill the 225 PPE Kits.
Response: See response to Item #1 of this Amendment.
 
3.  Regarding suits and gloves.  Since you’ve stated that these are training kits only, I would also recommend a lesser suit and a lesser glove.  We have a black nitrile glove that would look like Butyl, but would be much less expensive.  The same goes for the suit.  Tychem F™ Sealed Seam is a very durable, chemical resistive suit. For training, how about a plain Tyvek™ material with the hood, boot and elastic wrists?
Response:  For the Nitrile Gloves, there is no manufacturer specified.  Item must meet specifications that were previously identified.  The Tychem Type F (Lakeland #60151-Gray) coverall is the item required for this training environment. 
 
4.  Another item we typically include in PPE Kits is Kappler® Chem Tape™.  The tape is used to seal suit-to-glove and suit-to-boot seams.  Since these are training kits, you could simply use duct tape to save money. It would make this PPE training kit more realistic to donning an ensemble such as this.
Response: No Chem-Tape is required.
.           
5.  Regarding the bag:  Since these are training only PPE kits, I would recommend a low end bag.  My research so far puts the duffel bag with internal and external pockets plus handles and should strap in the $50-60 range.  A plain-jane duffel bag would be in the $12-14 range.
Response:  Galls item #BG186 or equal. Please comply with specifications identified in Amendment 1.   (A nylon bag (31” long, 14” wide and 14” high) with carrying handles and shoulder strap(s) used to hold all of the elements of one each PPE Kit, consisting of a Millennium Mask with filter, 1 pair of Tychem coveralls, 1 pair of Rubber Butyl Gloves, 5 pair of Nitrile gloves and 1 pair of chemical protective over boots.)

 6.  Can you confirm that the Norcross Servus chemical protective boot you’re specifying is their model #43995?   
Response:  The Protective Overboot – Norcross/Servus Item #11095 or equal.
 
7.  Do you have a particular mfg/brand & part number to reference for the butyl gloves?
Response:  Manufacturer: North B161/ Butyl glove – smooth finish.
 
8.  Do you have a particular mfg/brand & part number to reference for the nitrile gloves?
Response: See response to item #3 of this Amendment.
 
9.  Do you have a particular mfg/brand & part number to reference for the kit bags?
Response: See response to item #5 of this Amendment.
 
The date and time for receipt of quotes is changed to August 17, 2006 at 4:00 p.m.

<DESC>This amendment to the combined synopsis/solicitation provides answers to the questions received, adjusts the options requested and adjusts the response date.

Questions and Answers:

The question we received from several sources was based on the fact that the manufacturer did not provide future dated pricing at the time of this RFQ's posting.  Renewals were quoted in one, two or three year packages.  The Government cannot fund future year requirements with current year funding.  It cannot, therefore, purchase two and three year packages with current funding.  In the case of software updates/support, the requirement has to be verified as required each year.  Therefore, the Government asks for option years to be priced and, though the Government intends to exercise the options established, it is after the need is verified and the funding is available.  We have spoken with the manufacturer.  We understand that they will provide pricing for the base period, which is currently funded, and two, one-year, option periods.  Therefore, the options requested below are limited to only two out-years.  That change is hereby incorporated.

<DESC>FUNDS ARE CURRENTLY NOT AVAILABLE FOR THIS REQUIREMENT.

The response date remains unchanged, all responses are due on 10:00 AM (EST) on 18 August 2006.

The purpose of this amendment is to post answers to questions that have been submitted.

1)  Where is this sprinkler system located? 
A-  In side Spray Booth and Blast Booth.
2)  Will the damaged equipment be available for viewing?
A-  No, because it is located with the other beadblaster equipment. 
3)  There is a sentence in the exhaust filter requirement that states it is to be 4” thick?? This sounds like a NESHAP filtration system. Is this what you want? 
A-  Yes. This is the only thing I can think of that is that deep. It’s a 20”x20”x4” frame deep grids.   
4)  Or do you want a standard exhaust filtration system?
A-	 No.
5)  Do we need a stand-alone sprinkler system installed? 
A-  No, hook to existing facility system. 

6)  Is there any provision being made to bring the pieces into the booths? These operations are usually performed by a monorail system.

A-  There is no monorail system, all items will be either carried in or rolled in.

7)  Clarification.  Guide wires and stacks are the responsibility of the contractor.

8)  Clarification.  Flashings are also the responsibility of the contractor

9)  Clarification.  Blast media and paint and paint equipment will be provided by the government.

10)  Clarification.  The paint booth that will be provided by the contractor must have breathing air and an alarm system.

11)  A layout of the old beadblaster equipment will be provided if requested.

12)  Clarification.  The entire floor for the beadblaster will need to be replaced.

13)  Do you have or can you get the pictures of the damaged equipment done by the hurricane?
A-  A picture will be provided if requested. 

14  ) When they sized the Natural Gas Line, did they include the volume required for the booth MUA? 
A-  Yes
15) We will need 5 PSI Gas Pressure and 23 therms/hour I found the Gas line. Make sure the gas company knows we need 5 psi at the meter.?
A-  Contractor is responsible for gas regulator and gas piping from gas source to the MUA unit.
16) On page # 3 of the SOW, there is a statement under General Construction that states:  Front of room will be connected to spray booth and will have a solid back wall.  My question is---why have a drive-thru Paint Booth when they cannot drive thru the Drying Room
A-  When we said drive thru, meant the (paint) item will be move from paint booth to drying room attach to paint booth.
17)  The paint booth is 12’ high and the drying room is 10’ high. There are also 10’ high product entry doors on the Paint Booth. 
A-  The dry room doors are bi-fold and will open inside the paint booth which the height is 12’.
 

18)  Clarification.  The facility is 60’x60’.  With the paint booth, bead blaster and clean room/dirty room, there is not room for product to be pull out into facility.
19)  On page #2 on the SOW it states that the exhaust fan is to be located on the roof of building. 
A-  The booth will have one (1) Vane-axial exhaust fan with non-sparking blades, complete with 230/460/3/60 TEFC motor, adjustable motor base and V-belt drive.  The booth will have a minimum calculated face velocity of 125 FPM through empty booth, be arranged for top exhaust and furnished with two draft gauges.  This meant that the spray booth will exhaust thru roof of the building not exhaust fan is to be located on the roof.
