<DESC>The Stennis Space Center Procurement Office intends to issue a sole source, firm fixed price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract to Orbimage, Corp., Dulles VA. 20166, for a large volume of space-based multispectral imagery of the Earth from the SeaWiFS instrument onboard the OrbView-2 Spacecraft.  The principal objective is to acquire data that is critical for the study of the role of the oceans in the earth's biogeochemical processes, especially the effect of the temporal and spatial variability in phytoplankton and their impact on the global carbon cycle. The data required must be space-based, global in scope and provide full coverage of the earth every two days (excluding cloud cover and low sun elevations). The instrument that collects the data must be well characterized and sufficiently well calibrated so as to provide for a long-term, stable record of the earth's bio-optical properties. The sensor used should have a sufficient heritage in the provision of data to the earth science community, including the public availability of data and a strong record of publication in peer-reviewed literature.  This heritage may have been generated on the instrument for which the data are being offered or from another instrument for which there is a sufficient degree of commonality with the current instrument so as to provide a seamless transition in the derived measurements.  This is a Commercial Item Acquisition under FAR Part 12.	The remote sensing data acquired in this procurement will be used by the NASA Earth Science community to conduct on-going global science research.  This is a sole source procurement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. The Government believes only one responsible source can provide the service that will satisfy the agency requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for quotation (RFQ) for competitive quotes. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:00 p.m. local time on September 21, 2002. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.

Physical security measures will be incorporated into the design, including maximum feasible standoff distance from roads, parking areas, and vehicle unloading areas.  This project will also require asbestos removal and lead base paint remediation as part of the demolition of two existing buildings on this site.  Comprehensive interior design serv ices and a scale model are required.  This project will be procured using the two-phase design-build selection procedures set forth in FAR 36.3.  In phase one, offerors will receive a request for proposal letter including the project description, submittal  requirements, and evaluation factors for both phases.  The evaluation factors for phase one will be past performance, technical approach, relevant experience and sustainable design specialized experience.  No more than five offerors will be invited to par ticipate in phase two. The Government anticipates that the phase two documents will be issued on or about October 21, 2002. Award will be made to that offeror whose proposal contains the combination of those criteria offering the best overall value to the Government.  This will be determined by comparing differences in the value of technical and management features with differences in cost to the Government.  In making this comparison, the Government is concerned with striking the most advantageous balance between technical features and cost to the Government.  As technical scores and relative advantages and disadvantages become less distinct, differences in price between proposals are of increased importance in determining the most advantageous proposal.  C onversely, as differences in price become less distinct, differences in scoring and relative advantages and disadvantages between proposals are of increased importance to the determination.  The Government reserves the right to accept other than the lowest  priced offer.  The right is also reserved to reject any and all offers.  The basis of award will be a conforming offer; the price or cost of which may or may not be the lowest.  Offerors are reminded to include their best technical and price terms in thei r initial proposal and not to automatically assume that they will have an opportunity to participate in discussions or be asked to submit a revised offer.  The Government may make award of a conforming proposal without discussions, if deemed to be within t he best interests of the Government.  The Military Police Station building will be an option.  Estimated cost range of project is from $40,000,000.00 to $60,000,000.00. Network Analysis System will be required.  This solicitation is issued on an unrestrict ed basis pursuant to the Business Opportunity Development Reform Act of 1988 (Public Law 100-656).   This solicitation will be issued only on the Internet at ht tps://ebs.sas.usace.army.mil  and will be available on or about  September 5, 2002 and Phase two will be available on or about October 31, 2002.

This solicitation is issued as a Request For Quote (RFQ), solicitation number F05611-02-T-0055 in accordance with FAR Parts 12 & 13.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-06.  The proposed purchase order is reserved for small businesses, the clause at FAR 52.219-6, Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside and FAR 52.219-1, Small Business Program Representations (1/2001), applies to this solicitation.

LINE ITEM 0001: Quantity: 1 Job, Habitat Monitoring Protocol Development and Implementation, Unit Price:  $__________.  Total Amount:  $__________.
HABITAT MONITORING & PROTOCOL DEVELOPMENT?This solicitation covers development and implementation of a Preble mouse habitat monitoring protocol as outlined in the following scope of work. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services? (USFWS) Recovery Team Discussion Document for the Preble?s meadow jumping mouse (Preble?s) identifies the monitoring of habitat trends (quantity and condition) within all designated recovery populations as a high priority task.  Habitat monitoring will be conducted according to a Preble?s Habitat Monitoring Protocol that is reviewed by the USFWS, Preble?s Recovery Team, a peer review, and approved by the USFWS and the USAF Academy.  Developing a monitoring protocol will initially provide a means for assessing current habitat conditions, and may help identify where site-specific threat abatement management actions are needed.  The development and initial testing of a Preble?s habitat monitoring protocol could be used throughout the species? range.  Monitoring of riparian, wetland, and associated upland habitats on the Academy also directly supports management objectives outlined in the Integrated Natural Resources Management Plan.  It is anticipated that habitat monitoring within recovery populations will need to be accomplished, at some level, for a minimum of 10 consecutive years.  A standardized, range-wide habitat monitoring protocol will promote data sharing and analysis, comparison of conservation actions and needs between recovery sites, and a better understanding of the ecological requirements of Preble?s.  SPECIFICATION;  1) The Contractor shall develop a habitat monitoring protocol that can be used range-wide in assessing Preble?s habitat.  At a minimum, the protocol shall address the following parameters: habitat extent, habitat condition, and the status of ecological process that affect habitat location and condition.  2) The Contractor shall develop a protocol for monitoring habitat extent that quantifies the habitat length (stream miles) and habitat width (lateral extent) within a recovery population.  The protocol shall be capable of detecting changes and trends in habitat length and width that could be ecologically important to the recovery population.  3) The Contractor shall develop a protocol for monitoring habitat condition that quantifies the structure and composition of vegetation and its spatial arrangement within a recovery population.  The protocol shall at least identify major vegetation forms (riparian shrub, wetland, grassland, etc.) and measure vegetation attributes that can be monitored to detect change and trends in habitat condition.  4) The Contractor shall develop a protocol for evaluating the ecological processes, and their state, that affect Preble?s habitat.  The monitoring of ecological processes shall quantify where change takes place and the magnitude and direction of those changes.  The protocol shall be flexible enough to accommodate annual monitoring, as well as more frequent monitoring in the event of major changes that could affect ecological processes.  Key ecological parameters for monitoring shall at least include invasive and exotic plants and animals, fire history, flooding history, hydrological regime, grazing activity, predation, and beaver activity.  The protocol must also be capable of monitoring impacts to PMJM habitat that could occur from point source events such as a hazardous material spill.  5) The Contractor shall implement the habitat monitoring protocol on the U.S. Air Force Academy to provide a one-year initial testing of the methodology.  All access and fieldwork shall be coordinated with the Natural Resources office.  6) The Contractor shall meet a minimum of three times with the USFWS and Preble?s Recovery Team to receive direction and to provide progress updates.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to negotiate sole source firm fixed price delivery orders against BOA N00019-00-G-0176 with Northrop Grumman Corporation (NGC) St. Augustine, FL, for the development, integration and installation of structural and avionics components including the replacement of engine mounts on the F-14 aircraft.  As sole designer, developer and manufacturer of the F-14 aircraft, the contractor may be required to provide associated engineering, Integrated Logistics Support (ILS), quality assurance, reliability and maintainability programs, testing, training and technical, administrative and financial data.  Only NGC has the requisite knowledge, experience and technical data required to successfully complete development and integration of structural and avionics components including the replacement of engine mounts onto the F-14 aircraft without causing unacceptable delays in meeting the Navy's operational requirements and without substantial duplication of cost to the Government.  Additionally, NGC maintains proprietary rights associated with the technical data for these  efforts.

Specifically, this procurement is to replace the engine mounts with new mounting hardware to reduce the loads on the F.S. 737 frame.  Cracks have been found in fleet aircraft on both the engine mount and the F.S. 737 frame, and if these cracks grow to failure it could present a safety of flight issue.  Modifications will consist of inspections, force retrofit of D6AC steel engine mounts with AerMet engine mounts with new mounting hardware, and performing fatigue life enhancing measures on the critical radius of the F.S 737 frame.

3.  REQUIREMENTS

3.1  PHYSICAL: The bayonet must be a replica of the M-6 Bayonet that fits the M-14 combat rifle and the blade is to be nickel-plated.   The weight, balance and physical dimensions of the replica must be representative of an M-6 and must be manufactured such that it matches and fits the government furnished M-14.  The attached drawings are for reference purposes only, to aid the supplier in providing bayonets that fit the M-14 drill rifle.  An initial pre-production bayonet is to be provided to the government for approval prior to production runs. All production units will be manufactured and inspected to have the characteristics of the drawings and as fit checked with the government furnished rifle.

3.2  MATERIAL: 
a.  Similar to referenced drawings, except that the finish on the blade shall be nickel-plated.
(1) All bayonets must be interchangeable from one drill rifle to another of 		same and different production batches.  

3.3  TOOLING/SPECIAL TOOLS:  Tooling, special tools, equipment, etc. required to produce the product is the responsibility of the manufacturer. 

4.  GOVERNMENT FURNISHED PROPERTY: Actual demilitarized M-14 Rifle assembly will be provided for loan to the supplier to be used to ensure that the bayonet fits and matches the M-14 rifle.  The government provided M-14 rifle shall be returned to the government in the same condition as originally provided.   Contact LtCol Michael Trabun at (410) 293-7125.

5.  DELIVERABLE LOT ACCEPTANCE: Prior to production, the Navy will evaluate one (1) pre-production deliverables for acceptance.  Failure in any part to comply with requirements specified in paragraph 3 shall be cause for rejection of the represented lot.

6.  DELIVERY SCHEDULE:  Production deliverables shall be delivered as follows:

RIFLES
Qty	U/I	Del. Date	
BASE QTY AWARD 		
4100 	EA	NLT 01 March 2003	

However, expedited delivery is very important in this procurement and is an evaluation criteria for award.  Early and staggered deliveries are encouraged (see 7. Distribution below)

7.  DISTRIBUTION -The vendor may produce and ship throughout the 4- to 6-month period to reduce warehouse and inventory costs as long as the 01 Mar 2003 schedule is met.

<DESC>NASA/KSC plans to issue a Sole-source Request for Quotation (RFQ) for the purchase of several Trompter Electronics parts. These items will be used in support of NASA CLCS Simulation for the successful installation of the Real-Time Simulation Interface (RSI) to connecting racks. NASA/KSC intends to purchase the items from the Florida distributor of Trompter Electronics, Currie, Peak, Frazier, Inc., 7550 Southland Blvd., Orlando, FL, in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S. C. 2304 (d)(1)(B).  This is a sole-source procurement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. The Government believes only one responsible source can provide the product that will satisfy the center's requirements. Award to any other contractor would likely result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling NASA requirements.   The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). This notice of intent is not a request for quotation (RFQ) for competitive quotes. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to Attn: Ms Teri Jackson not later than 12 NOON EDT on Tuesday, August 27, 2002, by email or fax. Contact information listed below.	Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.   Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes can be viewed at the following URL:  http://genesis.gsfc.nasa.gov/nasanote.html

2. Demonstrated ability of the instrument to measure iodine at ng (nanogram)/ml levels and agreement to refine any existing method to insure that it will work with Total Diet Sample digests.
3. System should provide an autosampler and the software necessary to dilute samples that are initially off scale and rerun the samples without operator intervention and to have the capability to automatically prepare working standard solutions from a stock standard solution
4. The instrument package should include but not be limited to the following:
XYZ Autosampler
A reagent pump
All the required software, data interface and A/D board

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Laboratory of Cell Biology, The Chemical Immunology Section (CIS) plans to enter into a sole source contract with Therimmune Research Corp., 620 Professional Drive, Gaithersburg, MD  20879 for the continued services of Jim A. Turpin, Ph.D.    TRC will provide a wide range of antiviral evaluations tailored to meet the needs of the Government.  The evaluations to be provided include, but are not limited to, range of action assessments using a wide range of HIV-1 clinical isolates with defined genetic and phenotypic characteristics, such as resistance to one of more (multidrug-resistant) clinically relevant antivirals, activity against subtype representative virus and co-receptor specific viruses.  Mechanism of action studies are required to verify the specificity of NCp7 inhibitors for their proposed antiviral target, such as biochemical assays for the inhibition of reverse transcriptase, protease and integrase enzymes, and cell-based assays to assess inhibition of virus attachment and entry.   The mechanism of action studies will also include evaluation specific for the effect of NCp7 inhibitors on virus and cells.  This can include determining the virucidal activity of inhibitors on cell-free virus and/or alterations in the infectivity of viruses released from HIV-1 infected cells.  This type of study can also include assessment of the specific effects of the inhibitors by Western blotting on virion-associated and cell-associated virus proteins. These findings will serve to identify the diagnostic and characteristic abnormalities induced by NCp7 inhibitors on virus and on cells infected with HIV-1. Further studies will include in vitro models developed specifically by Dr. Turpin for the assessment of NCp7 inhibitors.  This includes assessing their effect in chronically and latently infected cell lines and primary cells and in unique cell-to-cell transmission models developed specifically for the Laboratory of Cell Biology. These studies will also include models developed by Dr. Turpin which are specific to Zn finger inhibitors.  Dr. Turpin is an expert in the field of NCp7 Zn finger inhibitors and his expertise includes practical laboratory knowledge on the effects of these inhibitors on infected and uninfected cells, and their positioning for advancement to in vivo animal studies. This expertise has been used in the last year to design a unique HIV-1 cell-to-cell transmission inhibition assay that offers a new avenue for the identification of inhibitors for this mode of HIV transmission and identification of new approaches to develop combination antiviral therapies using Zn finger inhibitors. It is anticipated that an award will be made for one year plus two optional years.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI research to determine if the party can perform this requirement.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), (Gene Response Section) plans to procure from Compugen, Inc., 7 Center Drive, Suite 7, Jamesburg, New Jersey 08831, the C-GEN Human Oligo Library (384) well format.  The Human Oligolibrary is a specifically designed set of print-ready 60-nucleotide oligonucleotides that were selected to best represent all of the organism genes associated with public mRNA sequences and will be used for various molecular biology experiments such as expression profiling, specific hybridization and Northern blotting.  The Oligolibrary will be supplied in industry-standard microwell plates manufactured by Sigma Genosys, which are compatible with the existing Government property in the (GRS).  Compugen, Inc. is the only provider of a commercial human oligonucleotide library in the world that takes alternative splicing into account.  An understanding of the distribution of splice variants in various tissues is extremely important in turn for understanding the physiological function of the genes as well as for diagnostic purposes. Alternative splicing has significant impact on both microarray applications and diagnostic applications. Compugen is a leader in the development of high quality long-length oligonucleotide libraries for use in microarray hybridization.  They use a proprietary informatics approach to select sequences from mRNA of genes that will hybridize effectively with current technology.  A critical component to this library is that target sequences are selected from different splice forms of the same gene.  Due to alternate splicing, different mRNA transcripts are generated which encode different proteins with different activities.  Therefore, we need to know which form we are measuring, which can be done with the Compugen product since the library selects oligonucleotides specific to particular splice form. This item is commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR 13.5. This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI research to determine if the party can perform this requirement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>PLEASE NOTE:  MODIFICATION 0001 TO THIS NOTICE STATED THAT COMMENTS WOULD BE ACCEPTED THROUGH FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 30, 2002.  THE CORRECT DATE IS FRIDAY, AUGUST 30, 2002.

The U.S. Customs Service is seeking submission of industry comments for the following Statement of Objectives (SOO):


NATIONAL PRIME INTEGRATION CONTRACT PROGRAM
INTEGRATED LOGISTICS and OPERATIONS

STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES

INTRODUCTION

This Statement Of Objectives (SOO) describes the basic objectives of the U.S. Customs Service National Prime Integration Contract for Integrated Logistics and Operations support for Customs inventory of High Technology Enforcement Equipment (HTEE) and is provided in lieu of a written Government Statement Of Work (SOW). This approach provides potential offeror?s the flexibility to develop scalable cost effective solutions and the opportunity to propose innovative alternatives to satisfy the stated objectives. 

BACKGROUND

The U.S. Customs Service has deployed over 6,500 technically complex and high value inspection devices throughout the land border crossings, airports and seaports of the United States. These devices, employing a variety of technologies, are tools to enforce compliance with all U.S. laws associated with persons and goods entering and leaving the country.  THESE DEVICES ARE WAR FIGHTING DEVICES AND ARE CRITICAL TO THE SECURITY OF THE UNITED STATES. The end user of the devices is the uniformed Customs Officer and the devices themselves are categorized as crew-served and individual.  Crew-served devices require more than one operator, individual devices require only one operator. The HTEE devices were manufactured by companies such as SAIC, AS&E, CSECO, Rapiscan, Olympus, Leica, etc. Maintenance is currently provided by the OEMs for their respective products via a variety of contractual instruments and by 10 technical support contractors to the U.S. Customs Service whose permanent duty stations are field locales. Training of Customs Officers is being provided by the OEMs, technical support contractors to the U.S. Customs Service and the Arizona National Guard.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES

The purpose of this Statement Of Objectives is to secure a prime contractor/business partner to be responsible for implementing the U.S. Customs Service National Enforcement Equipment Maintenance and Repair Program and Field Operations Support. 

This approach acquires, measures, accepts and pays for contract performance outcomes and results. As such, it leaves to the contractor to employ whatever prudent management and operations methods are necessary to deliver the results required by the U.S. Customs Service.  

Implementation of the contract must be scalable. The number of devices, the number of students, and the locations will be increasing for the foreseeable future.

The business partner shall be responsible for:

* full program management and controls of the logistics necessary to assure that the user will be presented with a device that will not only meet performance requirements, but which will be expeditiously and economically supported throughout its programmed life-cycle. 

*ensuring the proper planning and integration of all elements of logistics support and logistics support resource funds and management information.

* ensuring an orderly phase-in at the outset of the contract without compromising instant and scheduled maintenance and training actions.

* Ensuring an orderly phase-out in the event of re-competition or termination. This includes, but is not limited to, ensuring that all data developed during the course of the contract, with the exception of proprietary financial data, can be readily transferred to and utilized by the Government or follow-on contractor at no cost.

We are seeking to contract with a business partner who is a SERVICE PROVIDER. This business partner should be an expert logistics program implementer and integrator with focus on customer satisfaction.

Specifically, the business partner shall be responsible for:

1. Maintaining the HTEE at a minimum Operational Availability (Ao) of 95%.  

1.1 Service records and logbooks.

1.2 Fluid storage and waste disposal.  

1.3 Corrosion control.

2. Training Customs Officers to operate the HTEE. The content of training shall always be up-to-date with respect to the physical configuration of the HTEE and operating recommendations of the HTEE manufacturer. 

3. Implementing post-production support to sustain out-of-production HTEE, maintain configuration control of all equipment changes and project replacement  of high maintenance cost HTEE equipment exhibiting wear-out symptoms.

3.1 Implementing HTEE changes and modifications and exercising change control.

<DESC>BAA 01-42, Addendum 11, Special Focus Area: BIODYNOTICS: BIOLOGICALLY INSPIRED MULTIFUNCTIONAL DYNAMIC ROBOTICS.  The Defense Sciences Office is interested in new proposals in BIODYNOTICS (BIOLOGICALLY INSPIRED MULTIFUNCTIONAL DYNAMIC ROBOTICS).  This program represents a new thrust area for DSO that will comprise a multidisciplinary, multi-pronged approach with far reaching impact on robotic capabilities for national security applications.  Biologically Inspired Multifunctional Dynamic Robotics: The Vision.  One of the many shortcomings of today?s robotic platforms is the limited mobility and behavior in operational environments.  These limitations are largely due to the complexity of the environments in which robots are expected to perform and the lack of adaptability to unplanned and unpredictable change.  Biological systems, on the other hand, have adapted unique principles and practices that if captured in robotic platforms could dramatically increase their performance in tasks for national security needs (e.g., surveillance, search and rescue, sentry duty, logistics support, chemical and biological agent detection).  Specifically we are interested in:  (1) Dynamic Mobility: biologically inspired appendages to demonstrate multifunctional, dynamic, energy efficient and autonomous locomotion to enable revolutionary mobility capabilities such as running over multiple terrains, climbing (trees, cliffs, cave walls), jumping and leaping, and manipulating the world with an appendage in tasks such as grasping and digging.  The successful exploitation of biological appendages will also enable transitions between environments (e.g. a leg on land used to swim, a flyer perching or landing with legs, a swimmer emerging from the water and running on land).  (2) Behavior:  biological inspirations in animal behavior that will enable the ability to autonomously recognize and navigate in operational environments to perform critical simple and complex capabilities (navigation, terrain following, grazing incidence landings, target location and tracking, plume tracing, cooperative tasks such as hive and swarm behavior).  This activity may incorporate principles derived from biological behaviors of both single and social groups and 
(3) Integration: the integration of locomotion and behavior to achieve specific demonstrations using multifunctional dynamic biorobotic platforms, culminating in a Phase I platform demonstration with clearly defined metrics across a number of defined capabilities.  The ability to adapt to an ever changing challenging world is likely to arise from dynamical approaches to this challenge (rather than finite state machines) and proposals are encouraged that consider computational dynamics (e.g. neuromechanical closed feedback loops, dynamic signal processing and sensor fusion) and architectural aspects of dynamics (e.g. distribution of control between central and distributed control) are especially encouraged.  Each of these areas (mobility and behavior) will be integrated as phase I demonstrations of capability.  Phase II proposals will be invited from those phase I contracts that demonstrate the ability to successfully integrate the two tasks in one bioinspired dynamic platform and achieve clear metrics of performance across the stated tasks such as ability to complete the task, energy efficiency, adaptability of the platform, and others to be determined.  Integrated multidisciplinary teams are encouraged to form in preparation for submission.  Opportunities to create teams from component proposals will also be considered.  Evaluation of successful proposals will be based on the explicit biological inspiration and the integration of mobility and behavior in one platform.  Phase II goals will focus on benchmarking performance of the developed platform in operational environments.  Parallel research and development and iteration on platform design will be expected during Phase II in addition to proliferation of early designs for operational testing.  Proposals should clearly state phase I goals and milestones over an 18 month period.  Brief outlines of phase II milestones should be included with proposals.  Autonomous Locomotion:  The inspirations from biology that employ the use of multifunctional legged appendages for running, jumping, leaping, climbing, perching, swimming, flying, grasping, manipulating and digging are of interest.  Hybrid appendages that enable mobile transitions between air, land, and-water are also of interest.  The demonstration of these capabilities should consider opportunities to incorporate multifunctional materials that incorporate sensing and actuating performance, especially for grasping and manipulating, and soft elastic compliance and mobility of appendages or sub-appendages (hands, fingers, claws, wings).  Integrated sensors should be considered in this portion of the program that allows closed-loop feedback necessary to accomplish biologically inspired mobility tasks.  Design principles that demonstrate the dynamic interaction between neural and mechanical controls, the integration of force dynamic principles, central pattern generators or other neural control dynamics, and architectures of centralized and decentralized control are encouraged.  The ability of legged robots to robustly perform in the face of environmental perturbations and unplanned changes in terrains will be demonstrated in Phase I (18 months) of the program.  Autonomous Sensing and Navigation:  The new DARPA program in Bioinspired Multifunctional Dynamic Robotics will seek to integrate dynamic revolutionary mobility with functional capabilities that enable a robotic platform to perform relevant tasks for national security.  In order to accomplish this, the new program will exploit biologically inspired principles, mobility, sensing and navigation that will enable revolutionary functional capability in a robotic platform.  These include the dynamic symbolic representations and adaptive algorithms that enable autonomous sensing and navigation (coordinated sensory-motor activity) to targets of interest.  Performance capabilities of biologically inspired principles of target recognition in cluttered backgrounds, navigation principles such as terrain following, contact guidance, visual target tracking and acquisition, landing maneuvers, and chemical or biological plume tracing are possible modalities a revolutionary mobile platform could demonstrate.  These autonomous functions should be demonstrated by independent means where communications might be difficult or absent (prohibiting continuous geoposition information or other coordinates).  DARPA is interested in exploiting these biological inspirations in creating new robotic platforms that demonstrate revolutionary performance relevant to national security needs.  Interdisciplinary teams, which incorporate biologists, engineers, computational scientists, material scientists, roboticists, neuroscientists and biomechanicists are encouraged.  The exploited biological principles and practices should be clearly described in the proposal.  Phase I goals should clearly describe work performed in individual component development and the integration of components that will demonstrate stated capabilities and demonstrate functional performance of tasks.  Specific tasks should be chosen from a provided list of desired demonstration goals.  Proposers are encouraged to integrate as many of these capabilities as possible.  All platforms should be man portable, weather-proofed against water and soil contamination, and have operational run times of at least 4 hours.  Specific capabilities of interest to be demonstrated in phase I using a multifunctional dynamic biorobotic platform include: 1.  Running speeds of at least 3-5 body lengths a second over rough unplanned terrain; 2.  Jumping or leaping at least 3-5 body lengths; 3.  Jumping from a height of 10 feet and gliding or flying to a safe landing; 4.  Landing from air and running over rough unplanned terrain; 5.  Climbing slopes of 45-90 degrees that comprise glass, dirt, concrete or rock surfaces; 6.  Digging a hole of at least 6 inches depth;
7. Manipulating or grasping an object; 8.  Semi-autonomously or autonomously navigating to, and returning from, a specified location.  Initial tasks may develop individual components that complete the above-described capabilities.  We seek to exploit the multifunctional aspects of legged systems, so proposals that integrate as many of the above capabilities as possible are encouraged.  System integration of components should be explicitly described that culminate in clearly defined early demonstrations of capability in the first phase.  The second phase of the program (42 months) will choose from first demonstrations and refine capabilities to perform more mission specific tasks.
We would like to invite proposals that are far reaching in their implications, innovative, and ambitious in their goals and implementation.  It is essential that the preparation of proposals include the following areas: (1) A clear statement of the envisioned utility of the proposed research and development.  We are looking for revolutionary applications and goals that could be enabled if the proposed work is completed successfully.  While distinct goals for the execution of the proposal are required, the vision presented may extend past the performance period.  (2) A concise statement of the research challenges, approach, and potential anticipated solutions to the challenges that will be addressed.  This should include explicit timelines for which progress toward the goals can be determined.  Intermediate milestones with demonstrable metrics of performance must be included in the Phase I period (18 months) of the proposed work.  (3) A cost estimation for resources required for the proposed timeline.  This should include a clear description of the human resources needed as well as funding.  A management plan that describes how the different disciplines represented on the team will be integrated is critical.  
DARPA is sponsoring an informational and team-forming workshop in preparation for a new program in this area.  This workshop will take place October 7, 2002, in Arlington, Virginia.  Information regarding the workshop may be obtained at the following website: http://www.darpa.mil/baa/sn02-25.htm.  White Papers are not sought for this addendum.  Proposals received by DARPA before 4:00 P.M. ET, November 21, 2002 will be considered for the first submission.  Submittals after that date will be considered on a case-by-case basis.  Proposals (original plus three hard copies) should be mailed to DARPA/DSO, ATTN.: BIODYNOTICS Program, BAA 01-42, 3701 N. Fairfax Dr., Arlington, VA 22203.  DARPA will acknowledge receipt of each proposal within ten days and assign a control number that should be used in all further correspondence regarding the proposal.  For general administrative questions and proposal formatting, please refer to the original CBD Announcement, BAA 01-42 (http://www.darpa.mil/baa/baa01-42.htm).  Point of Contact: Dr. Alan S. Rudolph, Defenses Sciences Office, Phone: (703) 696-2240, Fax: (571) 218-4553, e-mail: dsobaa01-42@darpa.mil (Please reference "Special Focus Area: BIODYNOTICS" in any electronic correspondence.)

<DESC>Modification Two 
The solicitation has been amended to:
1. Delete the duplicate reference to Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-07.  
2. Remove the reference to Nortel.
3. Remove the requirement to fault isolation tools which permit trouble-shooting and in-depth traffic and protocol analysis.
4. Remove the inconsistency between the first and second page  - the requirement is one day response time for warranty maintenance not the four hour response time mentioned on the second page (this is consistent with Amendment One to the solicitation).
5. Provide further information on polling.
6. Change the description consistent with the above changes.
7. Provide answers to Offeror questions.
8. Extend the due date for proposals to Eastern Standard Daylight Time 2:00P.M., August 29, 2002.

CLIN 0001 has been changed to the following:

There is one contract line item number (CLIN) for this requirement. CLIN 0001 consists of a network resource utilization monitoring and capacity forecasting tool, which does not require the deployment of vendor specific hardware, to include delivery, installation, test and telephone technical support 24 X 7 plus warranty service including labor (24 by 7 with a one (1)day response time for warranty maintenance). Technical support and warranty service must be provided for 3 years.

The Description has been changed to the following in response to Offeror questions:

The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) has a requirement for a scalable network resource utilization monitoring and capacity forecasting tool for a 1000 node network. The network resource utilization monitoring and capacity forecasting tool must provide the following functions in a manner which will provide the INS business actionable projections for its network resources (bandwidth, port capacities, equipment types), which enhance the overall return on investment (ROI) in the INS information technology infrastructure and eliminate business continuity failures due to inadequate network resources: requirements include real-time network observation and alarming at the INS network operations center; two year historical summaries; two years or more raw measurement storage without manual administrator action; information on monthly recurring bandwidth costs; clearly identify areas where circuits may be downgraded or eliminated without impacting the flow of business data; provide a minimum of 30 second granularity with no data averaging or "smoothing" on circuit capacity utilization for at least two years; provide advance projections of future upgrade requirements; budgeting, planning, procurement, and technical data as well as access to third party auditing and validation of bandwidth providers; network modeling in terms of network design and "what-if" validation. The network resource utilization monitoring and capacity forecasting tool must be compatible with the currently installed INS IT architecture including: capable of installation on 1RU Sun/Cobalt server appliance; http/Java-based reporting and configuration; scalable on demand centralized or distributed data collection and storage with data collection from standard MIB-2 or Enterprise MIBs via SNMP; very efficient polling of specific MIB elements and built-in storage of raw data for at least two years without automatic averaging. Warranty offered must be better than or equal to the warranty offered commercial customers as well as warrant that the product and service provided are as described and fit and merchantable for the purpose intended. Delivery, installation, technical support, documentation and warranty service (on a 24 X 7, on call basis with a one (1) day response time) must be included in the fixed price of the software. Delivery (and installation) of the system shall be F.O.B. Destination, to Immigration and Naturalization Service, 425 I Street NW, Washington DC 20536 within 60 calendar days after receipt of the order. FAR 52.252-1, Solicitation Provisions Incorporated By  reference (FEB 1998), applies to this solicitation as follows: This solicitation incorporates one or more solicitation provisions by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text.  The Offeror is cautioned that the listed provisions may include blocks that must be completed by the Offeror and submitted with its quotation or offer. In lieu of submitting the full text of those provisions, the Offeror may identify the provision by paragraph identifier and provide the appropriate information with its quotation or offer. Also, the full text of a solicitation provision may be accessed electronically at this address: http://www.acqnet.gov. The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offeror-Commercial supplemented as follows - delete subparagraph (e) No alternate offers will be accepted. And FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items. Subparagraph (a) of FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation -Commercial Items, (JAN 1999) is supplemented as follows: The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other evaluation factors considered. The factors and criteria shown below shall be used to evaluate offers.

Answers to Offeror Questions:

1. One Offeror provided a catalog of items to the contracting officer with an e-mailed invitation to contact the Offeror regarding special pricing. Offerors are advised that simply submitting a pricelist will not suffice.  Offerors must respond to the solicitation in accordance with the instructions, providing the necessary price, technical and past performance information.  
2. "Is there any additional information, detailed specifications for example, regarding this solicitation?"   No.  All necessary information has been provided 
in the solicitation as amended.
3. "Is the Contracting Officer the appropriate point of contact for these questions?"  Yes.
4. Two Offerors requested information on where they could find the Federal Acquisition Clauses referenced in the solicitation.  The Federal Acquisition clauses referenced are available on the web site provided in the solicitation (www.acqnet.gov) under the section entitled Federal Acquisition Regulation. 
5. "In looking at this solicitation, it appears that there are many combined features.  We offer most of them, but are not aware of a product that offers all.  Since this is not a sole source solicitation, or does not have an NSN number attached?is there a particular vendor product available that does all functions, or is there a Prime that we may work with?"   The Government cannot recommend or endorse a particular product.  The Government will consider all responsive offers.   "Also is there a technical reference contact?"   No.  
6. "There is one feature that was put into this RFQ, I am sure was an accident, and that was for "fault isolation tools which permit troubleshooting and in-depth protocol analysis"."  The Contracting Officer has consulted the program office and the program manager has authorized the removal of this requirement as unduly restrictive. 
7. "Do we need to fill out Certs and Reps??"  Yes.  They must be submitted with your proposal.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to negotiate sole source firm fixed price delivery orders against BOA N00019-00-G-0176 with Northrop Grumman Corporation (NGC) St. Augustine, FL, for the development, integration and installation of structural and avionics components including the replacement of engine mounts on the F-14 aircraft.  As sole designer, developer and manufacturer of the F-14 aircraft, the contractor may be required to provide associated engineering, Integrated Logistics Support (ILS), quality assurance, reliability and maintainability programs, testing, training and technical, administrative and financial data.  Only NGC has the requisite knowledge, experience and technical data required to successfully complete development and integration of structural and avionics components including the replacement of engine mounts onto the F-14 aircraft without causing unacceptable delays in meeting the Navy's operational requirements and without substantial duplication of cost to the Government.  Additionally, NGC maintains proprietary rights associated with the technical data for these  efforts.

Specifically, this procurement is to replace the engine mounts with new mounting hardware to reduce the loads on the F.S. 737 frame.  Cracks have been found in fleet aircraft on both the engine mount and the F.S. 737 frame, and if these cracks grow to failure it could present a safety of flight issue.  Modifications will consist of inspections, force retrofit of D6AC steel engine mounts with AerMet engine mounts with new mounting hardware, and performing fatigue life enhancing measures on the critical radius of the F.S 737 frame.  See Note 22.  NAVAIR Synopsis No. 20104-02.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions received from potential offerors and extend the due date for offers.  Question 1: Page 3 and 4 of the specifications Section 2.4.1 references 2 doors to the shelter.  Drawing E6 shows only one door.  Which is correct?  And if in fact there are 2 doors where does the other door go.  Answer: 1.  Doors: The design of the power shelter is to be determined.  The design shown in the drawings is only one concept.  Another would be having the transformer inside the shelter.  It may be therefore depending on the final depth of the shelter; a second door may be required to meet the safety code.  We have defined the second door from a safety standpoint, item (j). Question 2: Drawing E8 shows Nine (9) 30 amp receptacles.  Specification page 6, Section 2.6 requests twelve (12) 30 amp receptacles.  Which quantity is correct?  Answer 2: The quantity is nine (9) 30 amp receptacles.  Question 3: In Section 01781 Operation and Maintenance Data (O&M) shows five (5) different data packages referenced but there is no identification of which data package applies to which system.  Please clarify?  Answer 3: The five data packages referenced are subsets of one another not five different packages.  NRL requires 5 copies of all level of detail provided by the O&M and 5 copies of data that is developed to the lowest level, of the development in detail.  The due date for offers is extended to August 26, 2002.

<DESC>The work under this procurement consists of the contractor providing all labor, material, equipment, transportation, administration, and supervision to conduct surveys of threatened, endangered, or rare plants at Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Miramar, California.  Work may include surveying approximately 7,000 acres for 17 rare plants that potentially occur on MCAS Miramar, collecting and mounting plant species, mapping the location and extent of each plant species, and drafting various reports as may be required.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 541620.  This requirement is being solicited on an unrestricted basis.  The Government anticipates awarding a Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Indefinite Quantity Indefinite Delivery (IDIQ) contract.  Firms responding to this solicitation must show experience consistent with the following evaluation factors:  (1) past performance information; (2) technical experience/key personnel qualifications/requirements; (2A) Bachelor?s degree with an emphasis in botany, ecology, or a related science; (2B) three years of local experience in identifying and surveying for rare plants within The Jepson Manual?s floristic province entitled ?Southwestern California, South Coast (SW SCo);? (2C) a familiarity with rare plants found within coastal sage scrub, chaparral, riparian, vernal pools, and oak woodland flora and ecology, autecology, and soils experience); (3) price.  When the proposal is evaluated, Factors 1 and 2 are equal in importance.  Within Factor 2, Subfactor 2B is considered more important than Subfactors 2A and 2C.  Notwithstanding the relative importance of Subfactors, the influence of the Subfactors will depend in large measure upon the nature and range of actual variation in differences among the proposals received.  In general, the greater the range of quality of the proposals received for any technical Subfactor, the more influential that Subfactor will be.  [For example, if the difference between the best and worst proposals on Subfactor 2A is great, while the difference between the best and worst proposals on Subfactor 2C is small, then Subfactor 2A will be more influential than Subfactor 2C when the Government determines which offer represents the best value.]  When the proposal is evaluated as a whole, Factors 1 and 2 combined are approximately equal in importance to Factor 3.  The source selection process will identify whether offerors meet the evaluation criteria specified, and select the responsive, responsible offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government.  The award will consist of a base year and four one-year option periods.  The minimum guarantee for the contract is $2,000.00.  Work will be ordered on individual Task Orders placed against the contract.  The availability of the solicitation will be limited to electronic media; the solicitation will be available for viewing and downloading, free of charge, via the electronic solicitation website:  http://esol.navfac.navy.mil.  The official planholder?s list will be maintained on, and may be printed from, the website.  All prospective offerors and planrooms are required to register as planholders on the website.  Notification of any updates or amendments to the solicitation will be posted on the website only.  IT IS THE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE OFFEROR TO CONTINUALLY VIEW THE WEBSITE FOR CHANGES.  The solicitation will be made available approximately August 6, 2002.

<DESC>THIS IS AMENDMENT SIX TO NRC'S SOLICITATION NO. RS-ACR-02-300 ENTITLED "TECHNICAL ENGINEERING SERVICES AND POLICY SUPPORT".  THIS AMENDMENT IS A CONTINUATION OF NRC'S CONFLICT OF INTEREST PROVISIONS.

?2009.570-8  Subcontracts.

	The contracting officer shall require offerors and contractors to submit a representation statement from all subcontractors (other than a supply subcontractor) and consultants performing services in excess of $10,000 in accordance with ?2009.570-4(b).  The contracting officer shall require the contractor to include contract clauses in accordance with ?2009.570-5 in consultant agreements or subcontracts involving performance of work under a prime contract.

?2009.570-9  Waiver.

	(a)	The contracting officer determines the need to seek a waiver for specific contract awards with the advice and concurrence of the program office director and legal counsel.  Upon the recommendation of the Senior Procurement Executive, and after consultation with legal counsel, the Executive Director for Operations may waive the policy in specific cases if he determines that it is in the best interest of the United States to do so.

	(b)	Waiver action is strictly limited to those situations in which:

	(1)	The work to be performed under contract is vital to the NRC program;

	(2)	The work cannot be satisfactorily performed except by a contractor whose interests give rise to a question of conflict of interest.

	(3)	Contractual and/or technical review and surveillance methods can be employed by the NRC to neutralize the conflict. 

	(c)	The justification and approval documents for any waivers must be placed in the NRC Public Document Room.


?2009.570-10  Remedies.

	In addition to other remedies permitted by law or contract for a breach of the restrictions in this subpart or for any intentional misrepresentation or intentional nondisclosure of any relevant interest required to be provided for this section, the NRC may debar the contractor from subsequent NRC contracts. 

2052.209-71 Contractor organizational conflicts of interest (representation).

	As prescribed in ?2009.570-4(b) and ?2009.570-8, the contracting officer must insert the following provision in applicable solicitations and in contracts resulting from unsolicited proposals.  The contracting officer must also include the following in task orders and contract modifications for new work.
	Contractor Organizational Conflicts of Interest Representation (Oct 1999)

I represent to the best of my knowledge and belief that:

The award to ___________________________________________of a contract or the modification of an existing contract does /  / does not /  / involve situations or relationships of the type set forth in 48 CFR 2009.570-3(b).

	(a)	If the representation, as completed, indicates that situations or relationships of the type set forth in 48 CFR 2009.570-3(b) are involved, or the contracting officer otherwise determines that potential organizational conflicts of interest exist, the offeror shall provide a statement in writing that describes in a concise manner all relevant factors bearing on his representation to the contracting officer.  If the contracting officer determines that organizational conflicts exist, the following actions may be taken:

	(1)	Impose appropriate conditions which avoid such conflicts;

	(2)	Disqualify the offeror; or

	(3)	Determine that it is otherwise in the best interest of the United States to seek award of the contract under the waiver provisions of 48 CFR 2009-570-9.

	(b)	The refusal to provide the representation required by 48 CFR 2009.570-4(b), or upon request of the contracting officer, the facts required by 48 CFR 2009.570-3(b), must result in disqualification of the offeror for award.  
					(End of Provision)

?2052.209-72 Contractor organizational conflicts of interest. 

	As prescribed at ?2009.570-5(a) and ?2009.570-8, the contracting officer must insert the following clause in all applicable solicitations, contracts, and simplified acquisitions of the types described; ?2009.570-4(b):

	Contractor Organizational Conflicts of Interest (Jan 1993)

	(a)	Purpose.  The primary purpose of this clause is to aid in ensuring that the contractor: 

	(1)	Is not placed in a conflicting role because of current or planned interests (financial, contractual, organizational, or otherwise) which relate to the work under this contract; and 

	(2)	Does not obtain an unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of its performance of this contract.

	(b)	Scope.  The restrictions described apply to performance or participation by the contractor, as defined in 48 CFR 2009.570-2 in the activities covered by this clause.

	(c)	Work for others.  

	(1)	Notwithstanding any other provision of this contract, during the term of this contract, the contractor agrees to forego entering into consulting or other contractual arrangements with any firm or organization the result of which may give rise to a conflict of interest with respect to the work being performed under this contract.  The contractor shall ensure that all employees under this contract abide by the provision of this clause.  If the contractor has reason to believe, with respect to itself or any employee, that any proposed consultant or other contractual arrangement with any firm or organization may involve a potential conflict of interest, the contractor shall obtain the written approval of the contracting officer before the execution of such contractual arrangement.

	(2)	The contractor may not represent, assist, or otherwise support an NRC licensee or applicant undergoing an NRC audit, inspection, or review where the activities that are the subject of the audit, inspection, or review are the same as or substantially similar to the services within the scope of this contract (or task order as appropriate) except where the NRC licensee or applicant requires the contractor's support to explain or defend the contractor's prior work for the utility or other entity which NRC questions.

	(3)	When the contractor performs work for the NRC under this contract at any NRC licensee or applicant site, the contractor shall neither solicit nor perform work in the same or similar technical area for that licensee or applicant organization for a period commencing with the award of the task order or beginning of work on the site (if not a task order contract) and ending one year after completion of all work under the associated task order, or last time at the site (if not a task order contract).

	(4)	When the contractor performs work for the NRC under this contract at any NRC licensee or applicant site,

	(i)	The contractor may not solicit work at that site for that licensee or applicant during the period of performance of the task order or the contract, as appropriate.

	(ii)	The contractor may not perform work at that site for that licensee or applicant during the period of performance of the task order or the contract, as appropriate, and for one year thereafter.

	(iii)	Notwithstanding the foregoing, the contracting officer may authorize the contractor to solicit or perform this type of work (except work in the same or similar technical area) if the contracting officer determines that the situation will not pose a potential for technical bias or unfair competitive advantage.

	(d)	Disclosure after award.

	(1)	The contractor warrants that to the best of its knowledge and belief, and except as otherwise set forth in this contract, that it does not have any organizational conflicts of interest as defined in 48 CFR 2009.570-2.

	(2)	The contractor agrees that if, after award, it discovers organizational conflicts of interest with respect to this contract, it shall make an immediate and full disclosure in writing to the contracting officer.  This statement must include a description of the action which the contractor has taken or proposes to take to avoid or mitigate such conflicts.  The NRC may, however, terminate the contract if termination is in the best interest of the Government.

	(3)	It is recognized that the scope of work of a task-order-type contract necessarily encompasses a broad spectrum of activities.  Consequently, if this is a task-order-type contract, the contractor agrees that it will disclose all proposed new work involving NRC licensees or applicants which comes within the scope of work of the underlying contract.  Further, if this contract involves work at a licensee or applicant site, the contractor agrees to exercise diligence to discover and disclose any new work at that licensee or applicant site.  This disclosure must be made before the submission of a bid or proposal to the utility or other regulated entity and must be received by the NRC at least 15 days before the proposed award date in any event, unless a written justification demonstrating urgency and due diligence to discover and disclose is provided by the contractor and approved by the contracting officer.  The disclosure must include the statement of work, the dollar value of the proposed contract, and any other documents that are needed to fully describe the proposed work for the regulated utility or other regulated entity.  NRC may deny approval of the disclosed work only when the NRC has issued a task order which includes the technical area and, if site-specific, the site, or has plans to issue a task order which includes the technical area and, if site-specific, the site, or when the work violates paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3) or (c)(4) of this section.

	(e)	Access to and use of information.

	(1)	If, in the performance of this contract, the contractor obtains access to information, such as NRC plans, policies, reports, studies, financial plans, internal data protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. Section 552a (1988)), or the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. Section 552 (1986)), the contractor agrees not to:

	(i)	Use this information for any private purpose until the information has been released to the public;

	(ii)	Compete for work for the Commission based on the information for a period of six months after either the completion of this contract or the release of the information to the public, whichever is first;

	(iii)	Submit an unsolicited proposal to the Government based on the information until one year after the release of the information to the public; or

	(iv)	Release the information without prior written approval by the contracting officer unless the information has previously been released to the public by the NRC.

	(2)	In addition, the contractor agrees that, to the extent it receives or is given access to proprietary data, data protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. Section 552a (1988)), or the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. Section 552 (1986)), or other confidential or privileged technical, business, or financial information under this contract, the contractor shall treat the information in accordance with restrictions placed on use of the information.

	(3)	Subject to patent and security provisions of this contract, the contractor shall have the right to use technical data it produces under this contract for private purposes provided that all requirements of this contract have been met.

	(f)	Subcontracts.  Except as provided in 48 CFR 2009.570-2, the contractor shall include this clause, including this paragraph, in subcontracts of any tier.  The terms contract, contractor, and contracting officer, must be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.

	(g)	Remedies.  For breach of any of the above restrictions, or for intentional nondisclosure or misrepresentation of any relevant interest required to be disclosed concerning this contract or for such erroneous representations that necessarily imply bad faith, the Government may terminate the contract for default, disqualify the contractor from subsequent contractual efforts, and pursue other remedies permitted by law or this contract.

	(h)	Waiver.  A request for waiver under this clause must be directed in writing to the contracting officer in accordance with the procedures outlined in 48 CFR 2009.570-9.

	(i)	Follow-on effort.  The contractor shall be ineligible to participate in NRC contracts, subcontracts, or proposals therefor (solicited or unsolicited) which stem directly from the contractor's performance of work under this contract.  Furthermore, unless so directed in writing by the contracting officer, the contractor may not perform any technical consulting or management support services work or evaluation activities under this contract on any of its products or services or the products or services of another firm if the contractor has been substantially involved in the development or marketing of the products or services.

	(1)	If the contractor under this contract, prepares a complete or essentially complete statement of work or specifications, the contractor is not eligible to perform or participate in the initial contractual effort which is based on the statement of work or specifications.  The contractor may not incorporate its products or services in the statement of work or specifications unless so directed in writing by the contracting officer, in which case the restrictions in this paragraph do not apply.

	(2)	Nothing in this paragraph precludes the contractor from offering or selling its standard commercial items to the Government.

The costs and tasks of organizing this conference will be split between the two nations; the Department has agreed to provide conference arrangements, logistical support, as well as travel arrangements for U.S. participants.  The Department plans to award a purchase order to the American Institutes for Research for these purposes.  It is in the best interest of the government to have the American Institutes for Research conduct this work since the firm did similar work for the Department for the last US-UK binational meeting (Turning Around Low-Performing Schools, October 4-6, 2000) and is also working with us to provide similar services for the Embassy Forum on World Languages and International Studies (September 23-24, 2002).  However, all responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by the agency.  See the Statement of Work for more information on specific subtasks and deliverables.  Interested parties should contact Sambia Shivers-Barclay at sambia.shivers-barclay@ed.gov or 202-401-0234 for information on submitting a quote.

<DESC>The GSA Federal Technology Service is looking for messaging solution that will allow access to e-mails, faxes and voice mails from a telephone, PC or the Internet.  From a PC, users should have the ability to click on their e-mail and fax messages and read them on screen.  Users should also have the ability to click on their voice messages and hear them through PC speaker and/or telephone device.  From a telephone, users, along with listening to their voice mail messages, should have the capability to call in and have their e-mail messages read to them, using text to speech technology.

The messaging system should accommodate four thousand (4,000) users with room for growth.  The system will be used in a Centrex environment and will need to integrate with up to three (3) central offices.  The user base will not be on the same Local Area Network (LAN) and will not be on the same e-mail platform.  The majority of users will be Lotus Notes users, but will also have Exchange and GroupWise users.

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is in the process of analyzing the capabilities within the market place to provide manual and electronic records management/files activity services from either Government provided locations nationwide (Andover, MA; Atlanta, GA; Austin, TX; Brookhave, NY; Cincinnatti, OH; Fresno, CA; Kansas City, MO; Memphis, TN; Ogden, UT; Philadelphia, PA) or contractor owned/operated location(s).  The IRS' Brookhaven, NY site is anticipated to close in calendar year 2003.  The above-listed IRS sites receive and inventory individual and business returns, and associated documents; control and store files; perform special searches and retrieve files; perform re-filing; and submit returns for retirement to Federal Records Centers.  IRS sites comply with strict security and safeguard mandates.  The IRS is interested in those contractors that have existing facilities or have experience in standing-up a facility(s), or could occupy current government facilities, and be capable to perform all of the following functions: (1) Researches returns and documents.  The estimated annual volume of workload per site ranges from 4,500 to 137,500; (2) Performs cycle control servicing, to include receiving, controlling, and shelving all returns and related documents after Submission Processing has completed initial processing.  The estimated volume of annual workload per site ranges from 30,000,000 to 50,000,000 returns and documents; (3) Receive, sort, classify and/or set-up in Document Locator Number (DLN) or Alpha sequence all returns and documents.  The estimated volume of annual workload per site ranges from 5,000,000 to 8,500,000 returns and documents; (4) Pull returns and related documents after cycles have been shelved.  The estimated volume of annual workload per site ranges from 1,200,000 to 3,000,000 returns and documents pulled per site.  Returns pulled are required to be provided to the requestor within 24-72 hours of the request; (5) Perform re-filing of returns and documents retaining original and renumber Document Locator Number (DLN) and/or alpha sequence.  The estimated volume of annual workload per site ranges from 1,100,000 to 3,100,000 returns and documents re-filled per site; (6) Associates documents from files and prepares packages to be sent to IRS offices for classification.  The estimated volume of annual workload ranges from 105,000 to 690,000 per site; (7) Conducts special searches of returns and/or documents if not loacted after two requests and/or to expedite requests or problem resolution as part of the Taxpayer Advocate 24 hour turnaround time.

The volume of ELF-Clerical workload is approximately 12,500 at one site; (9) Perform Tax Account Support Activities entailing the receipt and control of taxpayer requests for photocopies and transcripts.  Perform shipping of filled requests to the taxpayer or other authorized third party.  The estimated volume of annual tax account support activities is 100,000 to 500,000 per site; (10) The contractor will provide at least one commercial vehicle and a minimum of one dedicated and bonded employee during normal business hours to perform daily delivery services of file shipments between the IRS Submissions Processing Sites and its supporting Files Activities location, and perform routine delivery service of files between Files Activities location and identified Federal Records Centers.  The contractor may subcontract delivery of files to the Federal Records Center so long as the subcontractor can meet the same security requirements and quality standards.  The Contractor should also state how it applies capability for building and ensuring quality into its operations and its experience in being subject to quality assurance inspections by the Federal Government.  The IRS may make available to the contractor current facilities and equipment, such as file racks and carts; and hardware or software to allow for integration with the necessary databases to conduct these services.  In the event that the Government chooses not to provide facilities and equipment, capability statements should include the contractor's ability to perform the above operations with contractor owned/operated facilities and equipment.  Contractor provided facilities must be within close proximity to Submission Processing Sites to allow for daily transfer of documents and returns.  Through this RFI, the IRS seeks interested, experienced parties to furnish capabilities statements with information illustrating the existence and experience in the services listed above.  Intersted parties shall also include cover information that includes company names, points of contact, telephone numbers, fax numbers, e:mail addresses for points of contact, and identifies the company as one or more of the following: (1) small business, (2) 8(a), (3) HUBZone small business, (4) small disadvantaged business, (5) women-owned small business, (6) veteran-owned small business, (7) service disabled veteran-owned small business, or (8) large business.  IRS will use the information provided in the responses to this RFI to assess the feasibility of a contractor operated records management facility.  Based on that assessment, IRS will decide whether to issue a solicitation for the services.  This RFI is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Small Business Size Standards and NAICS 2002
<DESC>The U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) plans to amend its Small Business Size Regulations by incorporating the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) 2002 modifications of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) into its table of small business size standards.  These modifications are limited to industries in six (6) of the 20 NAICS Sectors.  The modifications result in a small number of size standard changes to certain NAICS activities.  

On August 13, 2002, SBA published in the Federal Register both a direct final rule and a proposed rule to achieve this result.  SBA believes that the subject of these rules is noncontroversial and routine, and SBA anticipates no adverse comments.  If SBA receives no adverse comments to the direct final rule by September 12, 2002, it will take effect on October 1, 2002.  If SBA receives negative comments to the direct final rule, SBA will withdraw it.  SBA will address the comments to the direct final rule together with any comments to the proposed rule that it receives in a later final rule. 

Note: These Federal Register notices contained a number of formatting errors, primarily the deletion of dollar signs ($) that indicate monetary based size standards.  The Federal Register will publish a correction in the near future, but the changes do not affect the size standards themselves.  SBA will include the corrected Federal Register notices on this page after they are published.  Comments are due by September 12, 2002.

Interested parties can read the direct final and proposed rule at http://www.sba.gov/size/indexwhatsnew.html

<SUBJECT>R -- Notice of Intent to Award a Sole-Source contract to Inernational Resources Group
<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Mission to Guatemala/Central American Programs (G-CAP) on behalf of USAID/Panama intends to award a sole-source contract for approximately three months beginning on or about October 1, 2002 at an estimated amount of US$249,000 to International Resources Group (IRG).  The contract would allow the Mission Strategic Objective (SO), 'Panama Sustainably Manages the Canal Watershed and Buffer Areas' to continue activities through the end of calendar year 2002 without disruption.

IRG has been providing highly specialized services in the development of strategies, policies and legal/regulatory framework needed for sustainable management of the Panama Canal Watershed and buffer zones areas through EPIQ I.  The in-country staff has developed and exhibited unique implementation capability and has demonstrated that they possess and can transfer very specialized technical assistance for the achievement of the Strategic Objective Results.  There are some processes that have been initiated and can be completed with a high degree of success only with the technical capacity provided by IRG, this would avoid serious interruption in critical support to the Panamanian institutions.

The contract is being sole-sourced under AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(5) for the continued provision of specialized services.  In accordance with FAR 5.207(d)(xv), all responsible sources may submit to the Supervisory Contract Officer, a bid, proposal or quotation, which will be considered by the agency.   However, this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action is solely within the discretion of the Government.  This is a sole source requirement and we will proceed with the award on that basis.  No solicitation is available.

(i) price;

(ii) technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement;

This 4-digit suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the parent business concern for such purposes as identifying subunits or affiliates of the parent business concern.

(4) Registered in the CCR database means that all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, if applicable, and the corresponding Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, is in the CCR database; the DUNS number and the CAGE code have been validated; and all edits have been successfully completed.

(b)

(4) DoD has established a goal of registering an applicant in the CCR database within 48 hours after receipt of a complete and accurate application via the Internet. However, registration of an applicant submitting an application through a method other than the Internet may take up to 30 days.
