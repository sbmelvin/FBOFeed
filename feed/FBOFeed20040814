Sampling using longlines and gillnets to survey areas sawfish are known to habitat including the Caloosahatchee River, Ten Thousand Islands, Everglades coast and Florida Bay.  Surveys will yield estimates of sawfish abundance in particular habitats and provide individuals for telemetry studies.  Several telemetry approaches will be used to study the movement and habitat use patters of the sawfish including active acoustic tracking; pop-up archival transmitting tags and acoustic monitoring.  Data on sawfish encounters by the publish will be maintained and formatted to fit the existing database.  Genetic samples collected from sawfish will be analyzed to determine the level of current genetic diversity.  Specific deliverables will be required each quarter.

Secondary data gathering will focus on the kinds of information that relate to the historical importance of Navassa to both Haiti and the U.S., the historical importance of fishing to the communities of the Southwest coast of Haiti, and the cultural importance of,  and connection to, fishing by Haitians.  The project will have the following components:  research design and methodology; review of existing material; quantitative fishery data analyses; qualitative analyses; fieldwork; report writing and production. Deliverables; research design and methodology; pre-tested instruments; report outline; quarterly progress reports and field reports; information gathered; bibliography and final report in both English and Haitian Creole.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Center of Coastal Fisheries and Habitat in Beaufort NC has a requirement for a benthic habitat modeling using multi beam sonar. The project is a National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science continuing study of the benthic resources of the Tortugas Ecological Reserve, the Tortugas national Park, and those areas outside the boundaries and the protections of the Reserve and Pare for comparative analysis.   It requires a contractor to conduct multi beam hydrographic survey of 30 sites in the Dry Tortugas, Tortugas Ecological Reserve and the Tortugas Natl Park using Simrad EM3000 multi beam acquisition and processing system.  The need for detailed, 3-dimensional mapping of the benthic habitats within the TER is inextricably linked to the reserve issue.  Many reef fishes leave the structure of the reef at night to forage in adjacent sand, algal, and seagrass flat thereby importing significant amounts of nutrients on the reef environment, contributing to its  high productivity.  The mass transfer also ultimately contributes to energy requirements of small grazers that cannot themselves access adjacent, non coral reef resources.  The adjacent seagrass beds are consumptive uses and/or physical damage to the foraging/settlement environment could significantly alter the reserve’s productivity and biological diversity.  Habitat characterization using multi beam sonar is critical to determine the distribution of the sessile resources that a susceptible to injury.  The Government intends to negotiate with Geodynamics  Geological and Oceanographic Services in Pine Knoll Shores NC for the work.  Geodynamics is  unique.  Mobilization and de-mobilization requires 2 transit days since the company is based in Pineknolls Shore NC.  The multi beam swath surveys include 2 hydrographers; Simrad EM3000 multi beam acquisition an dprocessing system; TSS DMS-10 motion Reference unit and Meridian Surveyor Gyrocompass; Trimble 5700 dual frequency CPS receiver.  Final products include; processed (~tidal offsets, motion cross-validations, etc)  ASCii position and elevation data GIS ready grids, contour extraction, custom color palettes.  The cost of duplicating this effort would be significant.  Geodynamics is the only company found capable of delivering the products and services required.  Geodynamics in the only company on the east coast that has such a multi beam system.  Their research group is the only group that has developed an innovative and highly accurate way to map benthic habitats in three dimensions, which takes into account the 2Dprofile and allows data collection between the profiles.  Using these methods, Geodynamics can create seamless digital terrain models.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 15 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries,  Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC) in Miami FL,  has a requirement to acquire services for conducting a genetic analysis.  This involves purifying total RNA from a single species of Oculina using cesium-chloride centrifugation, isolating poly-adenylated RNA using oligo-dT bound to magnetic beads. The resulting mRNA will be used to construct a cDNA library.  Positive clones will be sequences, then regions flanking the repeats will be used to design PCR primers.  Ten to twenty primer sets that amplify consistently and exhibit intraspecific variation (based on initial samples from Florida) will be used to survey sampled individuals (from different Oculina populations and species as provided by SEFSC or obtained independently) and assign multi-locus genotypes.  Dr. Hellberg and Louisiana State University (LSU)will provide laboratory and molecular genetics expertise for the Oculina project.  LSU will conduct the genetic analysis.  Dr. Hellberg is the coral geneticist collaborating on this project.  He has previously applied several molecular techniques (mtDNA and nuclear DNA sequencing, Southern blot analysis) to study of genetic variation in corals and marine snails (CDNA library construction and screening) with repeated success.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries,  Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC) in Miami FL,  has a requirement to acquire services for conducting a study on reliable tools for determining sexual identity and reproductive condition of billfish.  The study is needed to properly interpret the movement of electronically and conventionally tagged fishes and to significantly improve stock assessments by enabling the collection of sex-specific catch data.   Dr. Duane Schultz, Professor of Immunology at the University of Miami Medical School has been conducting immunological research for 25 years and has numerous publications on the application of molecular techniques to resolve biomedical and fishery problems.   Over the past 24 months, Dr. Schultz along with scientists form the SEFSC has successfully developed a new, non-lethal protocol for determining billfish gender from extremely small quantities of tissue.  This represents a critically important capability for the research program.  It is critical that efforts continue with this state-of-the-art collaborative research effort.  The three tasks to be performed are 1. synthesize or obtain from commercial supplies the following antisera: a. anti-vitellogenin; b. anti-testosterone; c anti-ll-testosterone and d .anti-estradiol.  2.  Acquire and process collected gonad, muscle and blood samples from male and female billfish. 3. Prepare a report on the results of the study.  NOAA intends to negotiate with Dr. Schultz for the effort pursuant to the authority of 41USC253(c)(1), only one responsible source.  NOAA knows of no other sources that possess the technical knowledge of the study to date, experience,  expertise and unique scientific instrumentation needed to conduct the study.    The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.
