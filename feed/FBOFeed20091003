<DESC>Typographic Currency Overprinting and Processing (COPE) Inks Developmental Effort
<p><br />The Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) is conducting a developmental effort with interested ink suppliers to develop sheet-fed black and green Typographic Currency Overprinting and Processing (COPE) inks. This developmental effort will be open until such time as the inks are proven for BEP production use.</p>
<p>The inks shall meet the requirements of BEP Specification I: TCGB-1E for overprinting the obverse-side of United States currency with Department of the Treasury Seal, Federal Reserve Bank Seal, and serial numbers on Bureau COPE presses. In addition to meeting BEP Specification I: TCGB-1E, the inks shall match the color and spectral requirements of the reference inks provided by the BEP. Prior to receipt of the reference inks, the interested party will be required to sign a non-disclosure agreement regarding the spectral characteristics of the reference inks. Attached is the current BEP Specification I: TCGB-1E for typographic ink.</p>
<p>For initial screening purposes, interested parties are requested to submit a one pound retain sample of each typographic green and black ink with the Material Safety Data Sheets. The sample ink is to meet the environmental and safety requirements of BEP Specification I: TCGB-1E. The volatile organic compounds (VOCs) for the inks shall be 4% or less as determined by the test method in BEP Specification I: TCGB-1E. If the retain sample is approved, then the interested ink supplier will be requested to submit approximately sixty pounds of each ink for a press evaluation at the BEP's Eastern Currency Facility in Washington, DC and/or the BEP's Western Currency Facility in Fort Worth, Texas. Additional ink of each color may be requested for subsequent press evaluations. The ink shall be submitted in 10-pound cans with appropriate labeling.</p>
