<p>Place of Performance<br />National Institutes of Health<br />9000 Rockville Pike<br />Bethesda, MD 20892 <br />United States</p>
<p><br />DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT</p>
<p>Chemists in the NIDDK Synthetic Bioactive Molecules Section, Laboratory of Bioorganic Chemistry have designed and synthesized a series of compounds that are targeted to disrupt the zinc finger assembly of the HIV nucleocapsid protein 7 (NCp7).  This family of molecules operates by a different mechanism than any approved drug used to treat HIV viral infections.  Substantial in vitro work has been done to select candidates that show early promise to move forward as drug candidates.</p>
<p>The company, Bioqual has worked successfully with the above laboratory on a previous requirement.  The previous work established protocols for the required in vivo research tasks of the NIDDK proposal.  While these involve use of components within Bioqual's programs, the results cannot be considered as off-the-shelf deliverables.  The tasks that have been successfully performed and optimized by Bioqual staff in Bioqual facilities are a foundation for the preclinical development of the most attractive drug candidate. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires a data package be compiled and submitted before and Investigative New Drug (IND) can be approved.  An IND is required to more a drug to clinical trials.  Bioqual is experienced with the required research and the subsequent production of technical reports that to be utilized in IND submissions to the FDA.</p>
<p>Proposed project will be to continue and expand the prior experiments and the in vivo performance of a new drug candidate that is designed to inactivate HIV.  The animal studies are the next item in the critical pathway to assembling a regulatory data package for submission to the FDA.  Bioqual will next need to perform detailed mechanism-based studies in non-human primates (NHP) infected with SIV, the monkey version of HIV.  Animals receiving the drug will be monitored for changes in viral load and evidence of toxicity from the compound.</p>
<p>Task Area 1  <br />Contractor to discuss and define experimental design with NIDDK Investigator for in vivo administration of test and co-administered and control drug.  Contractor and Investigator will determine type of data to be collected and frequency such as: number of monkeys, weights, age, viral load, and any other measurements to be made before, during, and after project; instructions for preparation and use of drug, storage of dry drug, use of drug solution, etc.  Contractor to prepare and provide written protocol for NIDDK signature of acceptance.</p>
<p>Task Area 2 <br />Contractor shall acquire and maintain monkeys that meet the requirements of Task1. Contractor will receive from NIDDK Investigator active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) in sufficient quantity to meet the experimental design of Task 1 and all relevant handling instructions<br /> <br />Task Area 3 <br />Contractor shall prepare and administer drug to monkeys infected with SIV per the test protocol of Task 1, collect necessary samples, take and record all required measurements and communicate any concerns regarding drug (e.g. changes in physical properties of dry compound or dispersion) or animal health to investigator as soon as practicable.</p>
<p>Task Area 4<br />At interval of 2 weeks, Contractor shall prepare and provide oral status report for discussion with and comments by NIDDK Investigator.</p>
<p>Task Area 5 <br />At termination of experiments, Contractor shall prepare and provide draft written report for review by NIDDK Investigator.</p>
<p>Task Area 6<br />Following review and discussion of results by Investigator and Contractor, Contractor shall prepare and provide final written study report including the interpretation of in vivo test results.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS. The Government's intent is TO AWARD A CONTRACT/PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION.<br />The National Institute of Health, Eunice Kennedy Shriver - National Institute of Child Health &amp; Human Development in support of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) Digestive Diseases Branch intends to award a purchase order without providing for full and open competition the replacement of a fluorescent microscope. The project background is as follows: <br />The objective of our research is to understand the role of reserve stem cells in the maintenance and repair of the small intestinal epithelium. In addition, we want to understand the role of the reserve intestinal stem cells in the origin of small intestinal neuroendocrine tumors. To accomplish these goals we use fluorescent markers in the form of fluorescent proteins expressed by genetically modified mice, fluorescent antibodies that specifically detect expressed proteins that uniquely identify cell types or fluorescently labelled RNA probes. These fluorescent markers can be temporally and positionally specified and also identify marked progeny. The microscope we are requesting for purchase has special unique features. It is extremely sensitive and resolving. It does not require a separate room. It has an internal vibration isolating stage, obviating the need for an isolation table. It does not use lasers that require cooling systems and <br />the lower intensity light is gentler on the often live cells under observation. This microscope comes with software for image manipulation that is faster, easier to use and more powerful than competing microscopes. <br />Other unique and necessary features include:<br />1. 50,000x 50,000 pixel images in a combination of bright field, phase contrast, and/or fluorescence imaging modes (8 times faster than conventional methods). Stitched images of whole cross-sections or entire wells can be used within the "Navigation Window" to move the automated XY stage with precision to various areas of interest at higher magnifications<br />2. Anti-Photo Bleaching Mode<br />3. Service guaranteed for lifetime of product line with Temporary Replacement Units available <br />4. Fully enclosed inverted type fluorescence phase-contrast microscope
<p>The manufacturer is Keyence Corporation of America, 669 River Drive, Suite 403, Elmwood Park, NJ 07407. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334516 with a size standard of 1000 employees. The resultant award will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) <br />This acquisition is conducted under the procedures prescribed in FAR subpart 13- Simplified Acquisitions Procedures at an amount less than the simplified acquisition threshold ($250,000.00) and as supplemented by FAR Part 12 - Commercial Items.

<DESC>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS. The Government's intent is TO AWARD A CONTRACT/PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION.<br />The National Institute of Health, Eunice Kennedy Shriver - National Institute of Child Health &amp; Human Development in support of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) in )tends to award a purchase order without providing for full and open competition the acquisition of the West System. The project background is as follows:
<p>NIDDK does research on diabetes, receptors, gene, and protein expression. The western blot procedure is a highly used technique in this research area. The Wes Simple Western System is a state-of-the art system/apparatus that allows the automatic identification and quantification of proteins in a much faster and more accurate manner than conventional Western blotting techniques. It does not require the use of gels, transfer devices, blots, film or manual analysis.</p>
<p>The objective is to procure a state of the art nanoscale western blot apparatus that affords the following benefits:<br />1) The Wes system is a unique, automated size-based separation and nano-immunoassay platform that performs all the manual processes associated with a traditional Western blot.<br />2) The Wes system greatly increases the productivity of any lab using Western blotting techniques routinely and will also reduce research costs. <br />3) Time savings is another key advantage of the Wes system over conventional immunodetection methods. The Wes system only requires 2.5 hours per run. This contrasts with conventional western blotting, typically a two day procedure. This makes it possible to analyze 72-96 samples on a single day.<br />4) The Wes system conveniently fits on any lab bench. It only needs 57 cm D x 36 cm W x 36 cm H of space.</p>
<p>The manufacturer is ProteinSimple, 3001 Orchard Parkway, San Jose, CA 95134. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334516 with a size standard of 1000 employees. The resultant award will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) <br />This acquisition is conducted under the procedures prescribed in FAR subpart 13- Simplified Acquisitions Procedures at an amount less than the simplified acquisition threshold ($250,000.00) and as supplemented by FAR Part 12 - Commercial Items. This acquisition is conducted under the authority of 41 U.S.C.253&copy; under provisions of the statutory authority of FAR Subpart 6.302-FAR 6.302-1- Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements 41 U.S.C. 253c (1).

<DESC>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS. The Government's intent is TO AWARD A CONTRACT/PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION.<br />The National Institute of Health, Eunice Kennedy Shriver - National Institute of Child Health &amp; Human Development in support of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) in )tends to award a purchase order without providing for full and open competition the acquisition of an imager as specified below. The project background is as follows:
<p>The research groups within our branch have extensive needs to capture chemiluminescence signals as well as full color images of western blots to perform their work. Chemiluminescence is the production of light from a chemical reaction. This type of reaction is measured in a wide variety of protocols that we perform such as imaging and measuring Coomassie blue and silver stained protein gels, as well as acrylamide gels containing RNA and DNA visualized by nucleic acid stains such as SYBR Gold.</p>
<p>The Amersham Imager 680 CCD imager is a sensitive, robust, and easy-to-use CCD imager designed to provide publication-quality digital images of DNA and protein gels and blots. What separates the Imager 680 from its peer is its patented Fujifilm Super-Honeycomb CCD chip with large pixel area and Fujifilm Fujinon F 0.85 lens. This innovative technology collects more light than any other CCD camera on the market for superior sensitivity in low light applications such as chemiluminescence. It is also the only camera on the market that offers "no pixel binning." Binning allows charges from adjacent pixels to be combined and this can offer benefits in faster readout speeds and improved signal to noise ratios albeit at the expense of reduced spatial resolution. No binning increases the spatial resolution in images where chemiluminescent signals are quite low. Gaining the increased spatial resolution capability that the Imager 680 yields is critical to our need to document such reactions. Our labs require an Amersham Imager 680 CCD imager, a sensitive, robust, and easy-to-use <br />CCD imager designed to provide publication-quality digital images of DNA and protein gels <br />and blots.</p>
<p>The Imager 680 is the only suitable instrument due to the following specifications:</p>
<p>1. Camera with four (4) binning modes, including "no binning" for sharper images and <br />improved resolution of closely spaced bands.<br />2. Wide-aperture f/0.85 lens, to allow the most light to be captured by the Super CCD <br />chip. This increases the sensitivity and reduces exposure time required to acquire images<br />of low abundant samples.</p>
<p>3. Camera that cools to -25&deg;C to reduce dark noise giving less background noise during <br />longer exposure times.<br />4. Image Resolution - Maximum 2816 x 2048, 5.8 Mpixel<br />5. Wavelength range: 460 to 635 nm</p>
<p>a. Epi-white light: 470 to 635 nm<br />b. Trans-white light: 470 to 635 nm<br />c. UV transillumination: 312 nm<br />d. Blue Epi light: 460 nm<br />e. Green Epi light: 520 nm<br />f. Red Epi light: 630 nm</p>
<p>6. Chemiluminescent samples and and colored molecular weight marker can be imaged simultaneously with automatic overlay. <br />7. On-board Windows 7 computer with ability to connect in a variety of configurations: <br />operate the system via an integrated computer, controlled from a wireless iPad (WiFi),<br />a USB-connected touch-screen, or a traditional monitor with a mouse and keyboard.<br />8. Dynamic range with 4.8 orders of magnitude (16 bit)<br />9. Allows for calibrated OD measurements. The system is one of the only CCD imagers<br />factory calibrated for accurate measurement of OD in coomasie or silver stained gels.<br />10. Five (5) imaging options including colorimetric, chemiluminescence, and fluorescence.</p>
<p>The manufacturer is GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corporation, 100 Results Way, Marboro, MA 01752 . The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334516 with a size standard of 1000 employees. The resultant award will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) <br />This acquisition is conducted under the procedures prescribed in FAR subpart 13- Simplified Acquisitions Procedures at an amount less than the simplified acquisition threshold ($250,000.00) and as supplemented by FAR Part 12 - Commercial Items.

<p>NOAA ACQUISITION MANUAL (NAM) - 1330-52.270-304 NOAA ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)<br />a. The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:<br />1. Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.<br />2. Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.<br />3. Identify constraints in transparency and process.<br />b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.<br />c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.<br />d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:<br />1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions,<br />activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).<br />2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.<br />3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.<br />4. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.<br />5. The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.<br />6. The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.<br />7. The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).<br />e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.<br />f. The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.<br />g. Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.<br />1330-52.222-71 - NOAA SEXUAL ASSAULT AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICY APPLICABLE TO CREW MEMBERS OF VESSELS UNDER NOAA CONTRACT OR ORDER (MAY 2018)<br />(a) General Policy.<br />In accordance with NOAA Administrative Order (NAO) 202-1106, NOAA Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Prevention and Response Policy, it is the policy of NOAA to maintain a work environment free from sexual assault and sexual harassment. NAO 202- 1106 prohibits sexual assault and sexual harassment by or of any employee, supervisor, manager, contractor, vendor, affiliate, or other individual with whom NOAA employees come into contact by the virtue of their work for NOAA. The NAO includes NOAA's mandatory requirements for completion of sexual assault and sexual harassment prevention and response training.<br />It is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure that contractor employees maintain the highest degree of conduct and standards in performance of the contract or order. In support of this, NOAA urges its contractors to develop and enforce comprehensive company policy addressing sexual assault and sexual harassment prevention.<br />(b) Applicability.<br />The policy set forth in NAO 202-1106 applies to all contractor employees identified as crew members on vessels secured for use under a NOAA contract or order. Prior to performance, the contractor shall provide all contractor employee crew members an awareness briefing on the requirements of the NAO and a copy of or access to a copy of the NAO. All contractor employee crew members must comply with the NAO, which includes completion of the mandatory training provided by NOAA as described in (d) below.<br />The contractor shall include wording substantially the same as this solicitation and contract language in every subcontract for services involving the use of vessels so that it is binding on each subcontractor.<br />(c) Definition.<br />Contractor Employees - As used this solicitation and contract language, refers to employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members.<br />Attachment 2 AA 18-06<br />2<br />(d) Mandatory Training.<br />1. Completion of initial mandatory sexual assault and sexual harassment prevention and response training is required for all contractor employees identified as crew members in performance of this contract or order, in accordance with NAO 202-1106. This training will be provided by NOAA.<br />a. The training will include by-stander intervention training and specific steps on how to prevent and report sexual assault and sexual harassment, as well as training on drug and alcohol awareness in the workplace. The training will typically be provided within two (2) hours of the vessel's departure from port.<br />b. A copy of NAO 202-1106 will be provided to each crew member upon initial boarding of the vessel. Each crew member must sign a form managed by the vessel's Commanding Officer/Operations Officer verifying they have received and will comply with the NAO in its entirety.<br />2. For vessels at sea for more than 12 months, annual sexual assault and sexual harassment training, provided by NOAA, will be required pursuant to NAO 202-1106. The specific</p>
<p>format of the training will depend on the availability of resources (e.g. internet access).<br />(e) Reporting Incidents of Sexual Assault/Sexual Harassment.<br />Contractor employee crew members should refer to NAO 202-1106, Section 6, Reporting Incidents of Sexual Harassment or Sexual Assault, at .07, Reporting from Remote Locations, when reporting incidents of sexual assault or sexual harassment.<br />(f) Remedies.<br />In addition to other remedies available to the Government, contractor employee violations of NAO 202-1106 or other Federal requirements (e.g., law, statutes, executive orders, code, rules, or regulations) applicable to sexual assault and sexual harassment may result in:<br />1. Requiring the Contractor to remove a contractor employee or employees from the performance of the contract;<br />2. Requiring the Contractor to terminate a subcontract;<br />3. Suspension of contract payments until the Contractor has taken appropriate remedial action;<br />4.

Included in NOAA's locator, and<br />2.

It is, therefore, in the best interest of the Government to afford both parties an understanding of their respective obligations.<br />(b) Contractor personnel under this contract shall not:<br />(1) Be placed in a position where they are under relatively continuous supervision and control of a Government employee.<br />(2) Be placed in a position of command, supervision, administration, or control over Government personnel or over personnel of other Contractors performing under other NOAA contracts.<br />(c) The services to be performed under this contract do not require the Contractor or the Contractor's personnel to exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Government. Rather, the Contractor's personnel will act and exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Contractor.<br />(d) Rules, regulations, directives, and requirements that are issued by the Department of Commerce and NOAA under its responsibility for good order, administration, and security are applicable to all personnel who enter the Government installation and facilities, who are provided access to Government systems, or who travel on Government transportation. This is not to be construed or interpreted to establish any degree of Government control that is inconsistent with a non- personal services contract.<br />(e) Both parties are responsible for monitoring contract activities for indications of improper employee-employer relationships during performance. In the event a situation or occurrence takes place inconsistent with this contract language, the following applies:<br />(1) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing within 5 business days from the date of any situation or occurrence where the Contractor considers specific contract activity to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language. The notice must include the date, nature and circumstance of the situation or occurrence, the name, function and activity of each Government employee or Contractor employee involved or knowledgeable about the situation or occurrence, provide any documents or the substance of any oral communications related to the activity, and an estimated date by which the Government is recommended to respond to the notice in order to minimize cost, delay, or disruption of performance.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer will review the information provided by the Contractor, obtain additional information (if needed), and respond in writing as soon as practicable after receipt of the notification from the Contractor. The Contracting Officer's response will provide a decision on whether the Contracting Officer determines the situation or occurrence to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language and, if deemed necessary, will specify any corrective action(s) to be taken in order to resolve the issue.<br />(End of Clause)<br />COAST GUARD INSPECTION<br />Performance under this contract is dependent on the vessel passing a U.S. Coast Guard safety examination. The Coast Guard inspection shall be performed no earlier than two weeks before the vessels' scheduled departure and the Coast Guard certification must be obtained by the vessel, no less than one week prior to scheduled departure. In the event that the contractor does not obtain the Coast Guard inspection, the Government may terminate the contract, and the contractor may be liable to the Government for excess re-procurement costs. Inspection is required before the commencement of each charter year, unless the Coast Guard has issued a letter of inspection that is valid for the time period of the charter. The contractor will arrange for the inspection, and any costs associated with bringing the vessel to passing standard shall be borne by the contractor. A copy of the Coast Guard certification shall be posted on the vessel.<br />(End of Clause)<br />CHARTER VESSEL SAFETY<br />The contractor shall adhere to the safety regulations as set forth in Coast Guard rules effective on September 15, 1991, and as provided for by the Commercial Fishing Industry Vessel Safety Act of 1988 (specifically, 46 CFR Part<br />28) or subsequent additions or revisions. These regulations require that specified vessels be equipped with a variety of safety features and equipment.<br />A Coast Guard inspection of the vessel based on an interagency agreement between National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and the Coast Guard or 46 CFR Part 28 will be required prior to performance. In addition to the requirements of 46 CFR Part 28, the Coast Guard inspection will require conformance with standards for<br />lifesaving and firefighting equipment in the Rules for Small Passenger Vessels, which exceed the requirements of 46 CFR Part 28. Issuance of the notice to proceed by the Government is conditioned upon the successful completion of the mandatory Coast Guard inspection under Part I, Paragraph 15 of this contract. Failure of the Contractor to successfully complete the inspection requirements shall be grounds for termination of this<br />contract. Conformance with present regulations for commercial fishing vessels requires that the master or an individual in charge of the vessel ensures that safety drills and instruction are conducted at least once a month (46 CFR 28.270). Following personnel changes, safety orientations must be given to each individual on board that has not received the instruction or has not participated in the drills, prior to continuation of vessel operations. The contractor shall conduct such safety orientations prior to sailing on each cruise leg. Due to the frequent wholesale exchange of scientific personnel at cruise breaks, it is recommended that a full drill be completed early in each cruise leg even if less than a month has elapsed since the last drill. Each vessel must also have all required emergency instructions posted (46 CFR 28.265).<br />(End of Clause)<br />MECHANICAL BREAKDOWNS OR NON-PERFORMANCE<br />The contractor is responsible for maintaining all contractor provided equipment and vessels in a safe operating condition during contract performance. If a mechanical breakdown of the vessel occurs or other contractor provided equipment that is greater than 12 hours cumulative within a 24-hour period that begins at 0700 and ends at 0659, the vessel and all contractor provided equipment shall be considered off charter and make-up fishing days may be required at no additional cost to the Government.<br />The charter shall also be considered off charter if the Captain or Crew of the boat is unable to perform the duties as outlined in the Statement of Work in increments of time greater than 12 hours cumulative within a 24-hour period that begins at 0700 and ends at 0659. The contractor shall make every reasonable effort to resolve the problem causing the vessel, contractor provided equipment or Captain and Crew to be out of service and bring it back into service as quickly as possible to continue contract performance. Mechanical breakdown periods in excess of four<br />(4) consecutive or four (4) cumulative days may be grounds for termination of the contract. In the event that the breakdown requires the vessel to return to port for repairs, the vessel will not be considered back on charter until the vessel returns to active survey status as determined by the Contracting Officer in consultation with COR. (End of Clause)<br />FIREARMS<br />The Government prefers that no firearms be carried on board during the charter. However if the vessel has firearms on board that cannot reasonably be removed prior to the charter, the firearms may stay on board if the COR gives approval prior to the vessel departure. Any firearms approved for carriage during the charter period, must be kept locked in the Captain's quarters at all times during the charter. Onshore use of firearms shall be at the discretion of the Captain.<br />(End of Clause)<br />POSSESSION OF LIQUOR/ILLEGAL DRUGS<br />During the charter period, the possession or use of intoxicating liquor and/or illegal drugs by any person is not permitted and may be grounds for termination of this contract by the Government.<br />(End of Clause)<br />CONTROL OF PLASTIC DISCHARGES<br />Contractor shall comply with the Marine Plastic Pollution Research and Control Act of 1987, which establishes Federal requirements for controlling plastic discharges from ships.<br />(End of Clause)<br />WORKING CONDITIONS FOR GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL<br />The contractor shall provide safe, efficient working conditions and accommodations to the Government personnel free from violence, threats of violence, harassment (including sexual harassment), intimidation, and other disruptive behavior. The contractor, its agents, subcontractors, and employees, including the Captain and crew of the vessel shall not harass, assault, oppose, impede, intimidate, threaten, interfere with or make unwelcome advances toward any member of the Government field party. Violation under this clause may result in termination of the contract, at the discretion of the Government under the "Termination for Cause" paragraph of FAR 52.212-4, and in consequent liability of the contractor to the Government for any costs incurred, as well as debarment, suspension or similar action from future participation in government contracts.<br />(End of Clause)<br />PRESENCE OF FAMILY MEMBERS<br />Unless serving as crew, the spouses or children of crew members or owner(s) may not accompany the vessel during the term of the charter without obtaining written approval in advance from the vessel captain. Liability for any family members allowed on board during the charter is solely the responsibility of the contractor.<br />(End of Clause)<br />RECREATIONAL FISHING<br />Scientists and vessel's crew members may engage in recreational fishing upon obtaining permission from the vessel's Captain. Recreational fishing must be done in full compliance with the recreational fishing laws and regulations in effect at the fishing locality. Fish and shellfish caught recreationally may be consumed aboard the vessel or, with permission of the captain, be retained for consumption after the completion of the charter.<br />Recreationally caught fish which are retained should be clearly marked as such, including the license holder's name. It is the responsibility of each recreational fisherman to meet all legal and license requirements relative to the capture, landing, and possession of recreationally caught fish.<br />(End of Clause)<br />LIAISON AND COORDINATION<br />The Contractor shall coordinate efforts with the Contracting Officer or a designated representative. Any request or recommendation for a change shall be made in writing to the Contracting Officer for necessary implementation, if applicable.<br />(End of Clause)<br />HARMLESS FROM LIABILITY<br />The contractor shall hold and save the Government, its officers, agents, and employees harmless from liability of any nature or kind, including costs and expenses to which they may be subject or on account of any or all suits or damages of any character whatsoever resulting from injuries or damages sustained by any person or persons or property by virtue of performance of this contract, arising or resulting in whole or in part from the fault, negligence, wrongful act or wrongful omission of the contractor, or any subcontractor, their employees, and agents.<br />(End of Clause)<br />1330-52.203-70 Scientific Integrity and Research Misconduct<br />(a) Definitions. As used in this provision -<br />Scientific activities mean activities that involve inventorying, monitoring, observations, experimentation, study, research, integration, modeling, and scientific assessment.<br />Scientific integrity means the condition resulting from adherence to professional values and practices when conducting and applying the results of science that ensures objectivity, clarity, and reproducibility, and that provides insulation from bias, fabrication, falsification, plagiarism, interference, censorship, and inadequate procedural and information security.<br />Presentation of scientific activities results includes the analysis, synthesis, compilation, or translation of scientific information and data into formats for the use of the Department of Commerce or the United States of America.<br />Scientific and Research Misconduct means fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing scientific and research activities, or in the products or reporting of the results of these activities. It specifically includes intentional circumvention of the integrity of the scientific and research process and actions that compromise that process, but does not include honest error or differences of opinion.<br />Investigation is formal collection and evaluation of information and facts to determine if scientific or research misconduct can be established, to assess its extent and consequences, and to recommend appropriate action.<br />(b) General Guidelines<br />1. Maintaining Integrity. The Contractor shall maintain the scientific integrity of research performed pursuant to this contract award including the prevention, detection, and remediation of research misconduct, and the conduct of inquiries, investigations and adjudications of allegations of research misconduct.<br />2.

Primary Responsibility. The Contractor shall have the primary responsibility to prevent, detect, and investigate allegations of scientific and research misconduct. Unless otherwise instructed by the contracting officer, the Contractor shall promptly conduct an initial inquiry into any allegation of such misconduct and may rely on its internal policies and procedures, as appropriate, to do so.<br />4. By executing this contract, the Contractor provides its assurance that it has established an administrative process for performing an inquiry, investigating, and reporting allegations of scientific and research misconduct; and that it will comply with its own administrative process for performing an inquiry, investigation and reporting of such misconduct.<br />s. The Contractor shall insert the substance of this provision in subcontracts at all tiers that involve research being performed under this contract.<br />(c) Investigating Misconduct Research<br />1. Initiating Investigation. If the Contractor determines that there is sufficient evidence to proceed to an investigation, it shall notify the contracting officer and, unless otherwise instructed, the Contractor shall:<br />a. Promptly conduct an investigation to develop a complete factual record and an examination of such record leading to either a finding of scientific and research misconduct and an identification of appropriate remedies or a determination that no further action is warranted.<br />b. If the investigation leads to a finding of scientific and research misconduct, obtain adjudication by a neutral third party adjudicator. The adjudication must include a review of the investigative record and, as warranted, a determination of appropriate corrective actions and sanctions.<br />2. Finalizing Investigation. When the investigation is complete, the Contractor shall forward to the contracting officer a copy of the evidentiary record, the investigative report, any recommendations made to the Contractor's adjudicating official, the adjudicating official's decision and notification of any corrective action taken or planned, and the subject's written response (if any).<br />Back to Top<br />(d) Findings and Corrective Actions<br />1. If the Contractor finds that scientific and research misconduct has occurred, it shall assess the seriousness of the misconduct and its impact on the research completed or in process and shall:<br />a. Take all necessary corrective actions, which includes, but are not limited to, correcting the research record, and, as appropriate, imposing restrictions, controls, or other parameters on research in process or to be conducted in the future, and<br />b.
