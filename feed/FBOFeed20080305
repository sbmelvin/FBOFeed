This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the interim infrastructure solution of the project. The acquisition of the specified Stonegate hardware products is necessary to evaluate and demonstrate the feasibility of this infrastructure.  During the Joint Management Council (JMC) meeting held on July 25th, 2007, the IT JPMO was tasked to deploy and IT infrastructure at the Tier 1 consolidation posts to support IT as a shared service. To address this new direction, the IT JPMO has developed an interim IT infrastructure solution using the industryýs best practices. Technically, the selected solution is very similar to the current connection that exists between the two networks domestically. That IT infrastructure was selected because it would enable the majority of the pre-determined official applications in use, and since the design is already active domestically, a new complete risk analysis and adjudication would not be necessary, which would have added considerable time to the schedule. Security requirements from USAID and DoS were identified and used in this infrastructure design. Specific components within the infrastructure were chosen by the engineers based on USAID and Diplomatic Security requirements, the ability of the compatibility of the components within existing systems, and overall performance.  As this is a Brand name only justification, no one contractorýs unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the DoS and USAID security requirements as a key component of this infrastructure.<BR><BR>

For Administrative questions contact Deborah Dokes, 916-978-4322 The USDI BLM and Fish and Wildlife Service is seeking the development of a field-level data entry software tool to assist field in identifying, planning, analyzing, and quantifying a full range of fuel management and fire prevention/ education activities which are performed at the field office level.  In addition, there is a need to provide a single, systematic and unified inter-departmental system that will serve to feed detailed individual project type and cost information into various national-level data analysis and reporting systems.   These systems currently include BLM's Strategic Funding Initiative (SFI) and the USDI National Fire Plan Operational Reporting System (NFPORS).  This software tool will initially be provided as a demonstration prototype that exhibits the highest degree of functionality that can provided within the stipulated award amount. Additionally, the software product should provide the capability to generate pre-defined reports at varying organizational levels within the BLM and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife agencies. The software product would also be required to provide the capability to "drill down and up" from the national/state/regional office level to the field office/refuge level to view project and activity data. The scope of this project is to procure custom developed or commercially available software that provides the following features: "	Provide a systematic process to accurately and efficiently develop hazardous fuel treatments and fire mitigation activities at the field office level "	Provide a risk/hazard/value assessment data management component  "	View and validate data to reduce errors in submitted information. "	Provide the capability to generate pre-defined reports at varying organizational levels within the agencies  "	Provide a map-viewing interface "	Integrate historic and current data from various Government-owned sources  "	Prioritize projects based using local-unit quantitative criteria "	Provide an application program interface (API) to efficiently share data with other agency-specific systems (SFI and NFPORS). "	Provide end user support. Contactors submitting a quotation must be registered in the Central Contracting Registration web site.  The  address to register is www. ccr.gov.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541511, Custom Computer Programming Service.    Wages are based on Service Contract Act 2005-2055 Rev. 4 8/31/2008. A copy of the solicitation (BAQ080012) and its attachments, will be posted electronically at Fedbizopps at http://www.fbo.gov/ on or about March 24, 2008.  BACKGROUND The U.S. Department of Interior's fire management policies have emphasized the importance of reducing hazardous fuel accumulations on federal and adjacent non-federal wildlands as well as restoring the health and natural processes on our rangeland and forest ecosystems.  Through the effective, efficient, and economic application of information technology solutions, this RFP's purpose is to solicit proposals that will provide a hazardous fuel and mitigation activity development and analysis software program/system to support the USDI Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's National Fire Plan strategic vision, mission, goals, and objectives.  Although the USDI BLM and Fish and Wildlife Service is currently engaged in fire mitigation activities on an on-going basis, the Federal Wildland Fire Policy of 2000 and the National Fire Plan directs that increased and expanded efforts be undertaken to plan, coordinate and identify fuel management, fire education/prevention projects and activities for all federal lands on which there is burnable vegetation.  This new wildland fire initiative specifically focuses on: (1) working closely with communities-at-risk in implementing fuel reduction activities; and (2) expanding fire education and outreach efforts regarding fire prevention and mitigation in and around the wildland-urban interface. At the onset of the National Fire Plan (NFP), the USDI wildland fire agencies have identified the need for field-level software tools to assist field units in identifying, planning, analyzing, and quantifying a full range of fuel management and fire prevention/ education activities which are performed at the field office level.

            (JUN 2006)

(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)?
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held?
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.
(f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that [Check one]: __ it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWCPCD) intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Vehicle Control Technologies, Inc., 1900 Campus Commons Drive Suite 300, Reston, VA 20191 to acquire an AQS-20A Tow Body Yaw Controller Software modification and implementation.  Contractor support is required to redesign the yaw damper control software and to implement and validate the modifications to reduce the yaw rate damper time constant in the tow body software.  This requirement is not suitable for full and open competition for the following reasons: (1) Vehicle Control Technologies has performed all of the mathematic modeling for the AN/AQS-20/A tow body.  (2) Vehicle Control Technologies is the company that created and owns the yaw control algorithms.  (3) Modifying and validating the AN/AQS-20A tow body control is critical to the operations of the AN/AQS-20A and the use of another company to modify the algorithms may introduce new or change existi!  ng parameters that may induce unacceptable error(s) into the AN/AQS-20A system.  The Request for Quote (RFQ) number is N61331-08-T-8002.  The expected award date will be on or around 18 Mar 2008.  The NAICS code is 541330 and the size standard is $4.5 million.  The resultant contract shall be a firm fixed price purchase order.  A number note of 22 applies to this requirement.

<DESC>NASA intends to award a sole-source contract extension to the INDUS Corporation pursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source, in support of Goddard Space Flight Center?s (GSFC) Information Technology and Communications Directorate (ITCD). This procurement is to extend Contract NAS5-02038 for a period of 5-months, from June 1, 2008 through October 31, 2008, and to increase the total CORE contract value and IDIQ maximum ordering value.  ITCD is currently finalizing their technical requirements in order to go forward with the most efficient and effective set of technical requirements for follow-on to the current BASE contract. This extension is necessary to allow sufficient time for the competitive follow-on procurement.	This extension will allow for a continuation of current service orders issued, for modifications to existing service orders, and for new work until the BASE competitive follow on contract is awarded. The contract extension and increase to total CORE contract value and IDIQ maximum ordering value are necessary in order to ensure program continuity and critical mission support and to avoid significant technical impacts to the BASE program. The current Contractor provides the following mission critical services to GSFC?s ITCD: program management services; computer operations services; business infrastructure support services; application development, deployment, enhancement, and continuous support for business information systems; and sustaining engineering support.  INDUS Corporation, as the current incumbent, has the combined training, experience, and expertise to provide uninterrupted continuation of mission critical support.  Due to the time and substantial duplication of costs involved in procuring and phasing in another contractor, INDUS is considered the only contractor that can meet GSFC?s needs given the short period of performance for the extension. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:00 PM. local time on March 20, 2008.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training System Division intends to award a sole source follow-on indefinite quantity contract (IQC) to Outstart, Inc., a small business, located at 745 Atlantic Avenue, Boston, MA 02111, for the continued use of commercial Evolution Learning Content Management System (LCMS) software, maintenance, training, and technical support services in support of the Integrated Learning Environment (ILE). Outstart is the sole proprietary owner of the Evolution LCMS software and as such, has produced and owns the programming code.  Outstart personnel are the only source which can provide software maintenance, training and technical support services for Evolution LCMS software.  In 2009, the Navy intends to research alternative solutions for the fulfillment of Next-generation ILE (NILE) requirements.  This could lead to the development or acquisition of a solution other than an LCMS, or a new LCMS.  The Navy estimates it will take approximately thirty-six months from NILE solution identification to NILE migration and implementation.  The Navy intends for the NILE to be operational in December 2012.  The maximum length of the proposed LCMS contract will be 5 years, comprised of a one-year base with four one-year options.  The speed of NILE solution identification, migration and implementation will influence contract length.  This is not a request for quotation, nor an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation.  Requests for copies of a solicitation will not be honored or acknowledged.  The resulting contract will be firm fixed priced and negotiations will be conducted using other than full and open competition pursuant to the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Pursuing award through competition would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling critical mission requirements, potentially leading to the nonavailability of the LCMS.  The applicable North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 511210 with a size standard of $23M.  Questions concerning this sole source acquisition may be directed in writing to the Contract Specialist, Kate Holcomb, e-mail address: katherine.holcomb@navy.mil or NAWCTSD, 12350 Research Parkway, Attn: Kate Holcomb Code 25333, Orlando, FL 32826.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

EMAIL: michelle.maldonado@ amedd.army.mil.<BR><BR><BR>Below is the Formal J&A for your review:<BR><BR><BR>Justification and Approval for Other Than Full and Open Competition<BR><BR>1. Contracting Activity: This Justification and Approval for the use of other than full and open compe tition is undertaken by the U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity in support of the U.S. Army Medical Research & Materiel Commands Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center (TATRC).<BR><BR>2. Description of Action: This approval is be ing requested for a new firm-fixed-price contract to Shoreland, Inc. with FY07 Research, Development, Testing and Evaluation, Army  2 Year funds.  <BR><BR>3. Description of Supplies/Services:  This Justification and Approval covers the acquisition and ser vices of planning, full life cycle management, coordinating, executing, providing logistics support and administrative/ technical services for the 2008 Annual ATA/DoD/MRMC sponsored conference, 6  8 April, 2008, at the Washington State Convention Center i n Seattle, Washington.  The total dollar value of this requirement is $207,775.00<BR><BR>4. Authority Cited: The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304(c) (1), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or  services will satisfy agency requirements. as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1.  <BR><BR>5. Reason for Authority Cited: The proposed Contractor for this action is the American Telemedicine Association, (ATA) 1100 Connecticut Ave nue, NW, Suite 540, Washington, D.C. 20036-4146, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  ATA is the only source to provide these services, since this is their associat ions annual conference which they host, sponsor and convene.  They plan, coordinate and execute this entire event from start to finish. The ATA is intimately familiar with the workings of the TATRCs Telemedicine Portfolios and has the same objectives suc h as fostering modernization and educating the public, and alone possess both the historical background and knowledge required for this effort.  In additionl, the ATA was named as the co-host at the conclusion of last years conference by the Commanding Ge neral and is handling all aspects of registration and logistical support.  <BR><BR>6. Efforts to Obtain Competition: A Notice of Intent was posted on FEDBIZOPPS  on 3 March 2008 for a period of 15 days.  All responsible sources were invited to submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, for consideration by the agency.<BR>To date, no responses or expressions of interest have been submitted.  Based on th is information, there appears to be no other company with the background knowledge, expertise, and capability to provide these services.<BR><BR><BR><BR>7. Actions to Increase Competition: It is not practical to solicit these services because the technology  and services that are required for this conference are unique to the ATA.  The ATA are experts in coordinating large conferences in the areas of advanced medical technologies.  The ATA is a private, professional organization comprised of members both mili tary and civilian, who support the goals and objectives of the U.S. Army in telemedicine and advanced medical technology. <BR><BR>8. Market Research: Market research was conducted through a search on the internet for companies capable of providing support to the ATA conference.  Based on this search, no companies with this required capability were identified.  The ATA is the designated source and sole possessor of the services required for the annual ATA conference, because this is their conference.  The AT A is the only entity that dedicate 3 ? days to the field of Telemedicine and Advanced Medical Techonologies.     <BR><BR>9. Interested Sources: In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(14), a notice was posted to FEDBIZOPPS on 3 March 2008 announcing the Government s intent to acquire these services on a non-competitive basis.  The announcement indicates the Governments reasoning for accomplishing this award without competition.  All responsible sources were invited to submit a capability statement, proposal, or qu otation, for consideration by the agency.<BR> <BR>10. Other Facts:  <BR><BR>a.

<DESC>This solicitation is to announce the intend of the Nebraska Air National Guard (NEANG) to award a sole source contract for an upgrade of a Pump Logic Control Center with Bay Associates, 2560 Squadron Court, Virginia Beach, Virginia 23453.  The work i ncludes all labor, equipment, tools, materials, travel, lifts, licenses and permits required for:  1.  The removal of eight existing analog gauges and the replacement with six ITT Barton pressure transmitters and differential pressure transmitters on hydra nt system with adjustable, digital gauge/transmitters.  2.  Provide HART protocol interface handheld calibration device for calibration of pressure and differential pressure transmitters.  3.  Upgrade and verify Programmable Logic Control in pump control p anel to accommodate new hardware.  The reason justifying the lack of competition is because Bay Associates are the original designers, installers and programmers of  the NEANG Type III Hydrant System and Computer Logic.  Contracting with a company not fami liar with the Type III Hydrant System and Computer Logic jeopardizes this fuel delivery system.  Only the specialty repair and programming from Bay Associates will satisfy the requirements of the NEANG.  This solicitation has been set-aside 100% for small business.  Point of contact for the NEANG is Mr. Randall Hansen, USPFO for Nebraska- P&C, 1234 Military Road, Lincoln NE  68508-1092.  Email:  randall.l.hansen@us.army.mil. All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be con sidered by the agency.

In such event, the proven source must be a responsive, responsible offeror and also be the lowest in price of all proven offerors, price and price-related factors considered.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions posed regarding the specifications for the Impedance Measurement Systems and Standards.

A question was received inquiring about the adjustment accuracy, stability, and temperature coefficient for the standards (line items 3 and 4).

The answer is as follows:

Line Item 3
Four-terminal-pair resistance standards of values 1 Ohm, 10 Ohm, 100 Ohm, 400 Ohm, 1 kOhm, 4 kOhm, 10 kOhm, 40 kOhm, 100 kOhm, 1 MOhm

The short-term stability of these standards should be better than 0.2 ppm. Therefore, for a temperature coefficient of around 20 ppm/degrees C (typical), the temperature stability should be less than 0.1 percent. The temperature control should have resolution better than 0.001 degrees C with uncertainty better than 0.005 C.

Line Item 4
Four-terminal-pair capacitance standards of values 1 nF, 4 nF, 10 nF, 25 nF, 40 nF, 100 nF, 400 nF, 1 uF, 10 uF, 100 uF

The short-term stability of these standards should be better than 0.3 ppm. Therefore, for a temperature coefficient of around 30 ppm/degrees C (typical), the temperature stability should be less than 0.1 percent. The temperature control should have resolution better than 0.001 degrees C with uncertainty better than 0.005 C.

The due date for submission of quotations is hereby extended to 3:00 p.m. (est) Wednesday, March 12.

All other terms, conditions, and requirements of the original posting remain in effect.

<SUBJECT>16 -- 16; H-53E Critical Systems Armor (CSA) Technologies
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-sm
<RESPDATE>030208
<CONTACT>Ronald Guy, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-757-5223, Fax 301-757-5284, Email Ronald.Guy@navy.mil
<DESC>RESPONSES TO INDUSTRY QUESTIONS 

1.	What is the areal density (weight / ft?) and threat (if unclassified) for the existing ballistic solutions protecting pilot seats, cockpit and passenger floor areas, and the aircraft ramp?

Response:  BPS Floor / Ramp density is approx 6.25 to 6.5 lb/ft^2.

2.	Please confirm that there is an existing armor system on the CH-53D but there is not an exisiting armor system on the H-53E.

Response:  Disclosure not necessary for package submission.    

3.	Within the section titled "Desired Capabilities", you ask for the respondent to clarify if their firm can provide a total system approach.  Please define total system approach.

Response:  Total system approach refers the desired capability for the vendor to utilize proven systems engineering processes and methods for the aircraft level integration of this system.

4.	Is it the Government's expectation that any CSA contract awardee would be responsible for addressing (all aspects) how the CSA A and B kits will impact airframe structure and / or overall flight performance?

Response:  Any solicitation issued for this effort will articulate the Government's requirement.

The Naval Air Systems Command, Aircraft Support Contracts Department (AIR 2.3.2.1), Patuxent River, MD 20670-1127 is seeking information for potential sources regarding industry technologies available to protect all H 53E helicopter engines and other flight-critical systems from small arms projectiles with the intention of procuring the material and services on a competitive basis.  

THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  

It is a market research gathering tool used to determine potential business firms capable of providing these services prior to determining the method of acquisition and issuance of a Request for Proposal.  This should not be construed as a promise to contract. The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this synopsis.  

CURRENT SYSTEM DESIGN 

The H-53E-series helicopter is powered by three T64-series turboshaft engines.  The installed engines are covered by fiberglass cowlings hinged along the upper side.  The cowlings provide an aerodynamic fairing but no ballistic threat protection.  Damage to other flight-critical systems, such as main rotor and tail rotor flight controls and fuel and hydraulic lines, can force the aircraft out of its mission.  The helicopter is subject to hostile small arms fire and other threats when operating in combat areas.  A degree of personnel protection is provided by existing armored pilot seats and a ballistic protection system that covers the cockpit and passenger compartment floor areas, as well as the aircraft ramp.  The Navy is interested in solutions that would mitigate the threat of downing an aircraft due to damage to these vital aircraft systems from small arms and similar threats.  
 
DESIRED CAPABILITIES  
The Government desires a protective armor kit that could reduce the ballistic threat to critical systems on the H-53E helicopters.  The Government envisions a mission kit of armor panels or other protective means that could be installed as needed on any aircraft having mounting provisions.  The system would be easily removable at the organizational level for weight reduction when the aircraft is operating in a low-threat/no-threat environment.  There is relevant engineering design experience with a steel plate armor system for the CH-53D helicopter; however, the government has not yet defined a specific set of components to be protected on the H-53E.  The intent of this RFI is to assess the state-of-the art of the technology available in lightweight armor products that could be applied to meet this requirement.
The government is interested in unclassified written submittals of concepts and rough-order-of-magnitude cost estimates for protective systems with the capabilities described above.  Respondents must clarify if their firm can provide a total systems approach for commercial or non-developmental items that could be modified to meet the Navy?s needs.  Respondents should also describe their relevant experience with similar systems and the process they would envision for the development and qualification of a product to meet the stated need.  Please submit all questions to Ronald N. Guy, Jr., Code AIR-2.3.2.1, at email ronald.guy@navy.mil or alternatively at (301) 757-5223.     

TECHNICAL QUALIFICATIONS
The Government envisions a solution for the H-53E Critical Systems Armor (CSA) kits that meets the following operational and program requirements:
1.  Non-Developmental Item.  The H-53E CSA material that provides ballistic protection should be a non-developmental item to the maximum extent possible.
2.  Qualification.  The H-53E CSA material that provides ballistic protection must be qualified and demonstrate compliance to the helicopter?s environment.  This includes, but is not limited to compliance with MIL-STD-810F, Change 3 and/or DO-160E environmental conditions for helicopters.  Proof of qualification / compliance in robust dust / sand, fog / rain, snow / ice, exposure to contaminants, and salt environments should be addressed in the response.
3.  Mission Removable.  The H-53E CSA will consist of an A-Kit and B-Kit.  The goal is to have commonality between CH-53E and MH-53E systems. The A kit, also referred to as installation kit, shall consist of permanent or semi-permanent installations / modifications to the aircraft.  It is desirable to have the H-53E CSA installed with little or no permanent aircraft modifications.  It is recognized that a specific A-Kit may be required for each helicopter type/model/series.   The B-Kit, also referred to as the mission removable kit, shall consist of components / assemblies which may be installed or removed as mission requirements dictate.  It is desirable that the CSA Kit would be easily removable for weight reduction when the aircraft is operating in a low threat / no threat environment.  The time to install / remove the B-Kit items will not impact mission availability for the aircraft.  The H-53E CSA must be practical to be retrofitted at a USMC organizational level facility, or by a field modification team / installed at the organizational level.
4.  Maintenance, Inspection and Repair.  The Government desires a system with minimal maintenance and inspection requirements at the organizational level.  The system should also be easily repairable for deployed units.      
5.  H-53E Performance Impact.  It is desired that installation of the H-53E CSA kit will result in limited degradation to existing range, performance / handling, and/or existing mission capabilities of either H-53E platforms. 
6.  Ballistic Protection Characteristics.  The H-53E CSA kit will provide adequate ballistic protection for its threat environment.  Interested parties should provide a summary of the proposed survivability capabilities within the H-53E CSA Kit proposal.  Threat magnitude capability (MIL-PRF-46103 standard or industry equivalent), repeatability and number of hits per a given area should be included as a minimum.  The contractor should address proven demonstration of this capability (through test and qualification data, etc) in their response. 
7.  Ballistic Protection / Coverage Areas and Weight.  The Government has not yet defined a specific set of components and/or areas to be protected on the H-53E platforms by the H-53E CSA Kit.  It is desired that the contractor define proposed coverage areas for the H-53E CSA kit in their response, and applicable weight for the CSA Kit based on their proposed coverage areas.   A desired CSA armor area density envisioned is 6.5 pounds per square feet or less. 

CAPABILITY STATEMENT PACKAGE

Documentation should be in bullet format and must address, at a minimum, any prior/current corporate experience with the military performing efforts of similar size and scope within the last three years, including contract number, unclassified technical performance capabilities, organization/platform supported, and contract value.

Further, the sole awardee and only the sole awardee shall submit its invoice to the government and receive payment from the government.<BR><BR>(a) The provider of information technology shall certify applications are fully functional and operate correctly as intended on systems using the Federal Desktop Core Configuration (FDCC). This includes Internet Explorer 7 configured to operate on Windows XP and Vista (in Protected Mode on Vista). For the Windows XP settings, see http://csrc.nist.gov/itsec/guidance_WinXP.html and for the Windows Vista settings, see: http://csrc.nist.gov/itsec/guidance_vista.html.

(d) The Department of State currently intends to use Vista in Protected Mode in the future when all devices at all worldwide locations have sufficient capacity to permit an upgrade from the XP operating system.<BR><BR>The office of Acquisition management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS) is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Information Resource Management, E-mail division (IRM/OPS/MSO/EML). This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the purchase of BlueCoat Equipment and Maintenance. The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government's requirements, for the Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. IRM/OPS/MSO/EML has identified the BlueCoat product as a key component of the Department's core firewall infrastructure on OpenNet. The equipment listed above is required to expand existing equipment that has reached the processing capacity. The Caching Servers will continue to aid in the process of filtering out harmful web content and/or malicious code on the Department of State's critical operating environment. The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited as the statutory authority. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as the basis for the justification. Rather, the products identified by brand herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department's requirements as a key component of the Department's core firewall infrastructure. The replacement BlueCoat models are major components of the Department's firewall infrastructure and any deviations form the BlueCoat appliances and support would pose technical anomalies that could potentially interrupt the availability of web browsing to the Department of State employees. The goal of the Department is to form a cohesive network infrastructure where resources are available to end users under normal conditions and in the event of a disaster. Blue Coat equipment and support is critical for continuing production to the internet caching process. This is an urgently needed, highly-specialized, best-fit requirement, based upon prior utilization of BlueCoat products, maintenance, and support.<BR><BR>

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).  The purpose of this Notice is to identify potential sources that may be interested in and capable of performing the work described herein.  The NHTSA welcomes Corporate Capability Statements from all individuals and organizations.  The NHTSA does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or NHTSA's use of such information.  Acknowledgement of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of NHTSA's evaluation of the information received.  As a result of this Notice, the NHTSA may issue a Request for Proposals (RFP).  However, should such a requirement fail to materialize, no basis for claims against the NHTSA shall arise as a result of a response to this Notice.  

More than one million motor vehicle thefts occur annually in the United States (U.S.), causing lost of mobility and economic impact to those affected.  In the U.S., two vehicles are stolen every minute and vehicle theft remains the nation's number one property crime, costing an estimated $7.6 billion each year.  Vehicle theft is also a global epidemic.  It is estimated that the global cost of motor vehicle theft is approximately $20.5 billion. 

The Congress enacted the Motor Vehicle Theft Law Enforcement Act in 1984 (the 1984 Theft Act) as a measure to reduce the growing problem of motor vehicle theft in the 1980's.  It added Title VI to the Motor Vehicle and Information Cost Savings Act (re-codified as Chapter 331 of Title 49, United States Code).  The purpose of the 1984 Theft Act was to help reduce motor vehicle thefts and to provide a tool for law enforcement to trace and recover stolen motor vehicles and vehicle parts while minimizing the cost increase to the consumer.

Under the provision of the 1984 Theft Act, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) published the regulation entitled "Exemption from the Vehicle Theft Prevention Standard", 49 CFR Part 543.  The 1984 Theft Act intended to encourage manufacturers to use anti-theft devices which could act as a further theft deterrent.  49 CFR Part 543 allows a manufacturer to petition the agency for an exemption from the parts-marking requirements of the theft standard of a vehicle line when it plans to install an anti-theft device as standard equipment on the entire line.  The agency may approve the exemption if it determines that the anti-theft device is likely to be as effective as parts-marking in reducing and deterring motor vehicle theft. 

The following is a summary of major events in the theft prevention regulatory history:

On October 24, 1985, NHTSA published the Federal Motor Vehicle Theft Prevention Standard, 49 CFR Part 541.  The purpose of this standard is to reduce motor vehicle theft by assisting law enforcement authorities trace and recover the parts from stolen vehicles.  

This standard became effective beginning with the 1987 model year and required that selected high theft car lines have 12 (two door models) or 14 (four door models) of its major component parts-marked with the V.I.N.  Each vehicle in a high theft line must have its major parts and major replacement parts-marked unless the vehicle line is granted an exemption from the parts marking requirements. 

As a result of an increase in motor vehicle thefts and associated crimes, the Anti Car Theft Act of 1992 (the 1992 Theft Act), was created.  The 1992 Theft Act amended the Theft Prevention Standard by extending the Federal parts-marking requirements to include light-duty trucks and multipurpose passenger vehicles (with a GVWR of 6,000 pounds or less).  On December 13, 1994, the final rule amending the Theft Prevention Standard was published.  This December 1994 rulemaking extended the parts-marking requirements:  (a) to include multipurpose passenger vehicles and light-duty trucks; (b) listed the major component parts and replacement parts to be marked for each of the classes of vehicles such as the engine, transmission, front/rear bumper, right/left front fender, hood, right/left front door, right/left rear door, sliding or cargo door(s), right/left quarter panel (passenger cars), right/left side assembly (MPVs), pickup box, and/or cargo box (light duty trucks), rear doors, decklid or hatchback and tailgate; and (c) established a new median theft rate (3.5826) for all passenger motor vehicles.  This amendment became effective beginning with MY 1997 vehicles.

On April 6, 2004, NHTSA published a Final Rule extending the anti-theft parts-marking requirements of the Federal Motor Vehicle Theft Prevention Standard, CFR Part 541.  This regulation expands NHTSA?s current anti-theft parts marking requirement to include: (1) all below median theft rate passenger cars and multipurpose passenger vehicles (with a gross vehicle weight rating of 6,000 pounds or less), and (2) below median theft rate light-duty trucks with major parts that are interchangeable with passenger motor vehicles subject to parts-marking. This Final Rule was effective beginning September 1, 2006. 

On May 19, 2005, NHTSA published a Final Rule responding to petitions for reconsideration of the new rule extending the anti-theft parts-marking requirements.  This Final  Rule made the following changes and clarifications to the agency?s expanded parts-marking requirements:  (1) manufacturers are no longer required to submit likely theft rate determinations for vehicle lines introduced prior to the September 1, 2006, effective date, if the manufacturers choose to voluntarily mark the new vehicle lines immediately after their introduction; (2) manufacturers are permitted to petition the agency to exempt low-theft vehicle lines equipped with antitheft devices from the parts marking requirements beginning with model year 2006; (3) vehicle lines with annual production of not more than 3,500 vehicles are excluded from the parts-marking requirements; and (4) the agency adopted a phase-in of the new parts-marking requirements over a two-year period.

Based on a recent analysis report by NHTSA's Consumer Standards Division, although improvements have been made in motor vehicle theft prevention, vehicle theft remains a persistent problem in the U.S.  The analysis report concluded that there is still work to be done and more focused research is needed to effectively evaluate the downward trend in vehicle theft rates.  

The main objective of the project is to evaluate the contribution of parts-marking and anti-theft devices to vehicle theft prevention and the downward trend of vehicle theft rates, through research and analysis of each technology.  Research and analysis should be conducted on the available technologies, the effectiveness of each, relationship of auto-theft to public safety, and cost analysis.  The contractor should draw on many sources of information, such as vehicle manufacturers, parts-marking label and anti-theft device manufacturers, law enforcement, National Crime Information Center (NCIC), Department of Justice (DOJ), Highway Loss Data Institute (HLDI), insurance companies, public and any other sources.

Format of Corporate Capabilities Statement:

Any interested organizations should submit the Corporate Capability Statement which demonstrates the firm's ability and interest in no more than 10 pages to perform the key requirements described above.  All proprietary information should be marked as such. 

All respondents are asked to indicate the type and size of their business organization, e.g., Large business, Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, Women-Owned-Business, 8(A), Historically Black College or University/Minority Institution (HBCU/MI), educational institution, profit/non-profit organization, in their response. Interested offerors shall respond to this Sources Sought Notice no later than 15 calendar days from date of posting. E-mail is the preferred method when receiving responses to this Notice.

<DESC>Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail, located in Omaha, Nebraska, is currently in the market research phase of their acquisition process. Overview of Acquisition Objective:  Video Editing-Logging Services Through 4 years of activity, an NPS traveling exhibit commemorating the Expedition of Meriwether Lewis and William Clark and the peoples they met, generated a quantity of approximately 1,600 time-coded video tapes (approx. 1 1/2 to 2 hours per tape).  It is our objective to have a qualified source edit-log the videos in addition to creating a database program (Microsoft Access) which provides us the means to search for specific keywords, phrases, topics, etc., which in turn, would identify the exact tape(s) and precise location (by time-coding) on the tape(s) pertinent to our search. As our staff does not possess the technical expertise and detailed knowledge, nor are we acquainted with the general costs for this type of service, we are asking for sources to provide us with their input and recommendations concerning information, data, market pricing, nomenclature, lead times, and/or other necessary specifics for this service.  By conducting this advance market research we will first determine whether the cost for such a service is a viable expense for the government, and if so, we would then incorporate the information we've gathered and learned into a Statement of Work which would clearly and precisely define our needs in the language, terms, depth and format familiar to the targeted industry for future solicitation. Should any sources have information, brochures, pamphlets, etc.. they wish to provide concerning the aforementioned service, please send by March 21, 2008 via hardcopy or email to:  Kathryn Logsdon, Contracting Officer, Lincoln Home National Historic Site, 413 South Eighth Street, Springfield, IL 62701, e-mail  kathryn_logsdon@nps.gov, Phone: (217) 391-3225.

<DESC>This Sources Sought was previously posted on 12 February 2008 as solicitation number FA4890-08-F-0006. The reason for this new Sources Sought is to change the NAICS code from 811213 to 237130. Further market research determined this change to be in the best interest of the Government.
Air Combat Command Acquisition Management Integration Center (AMIC), Langley AFB VA, is in the process of determining the acquisition strategy to obtain non-personal services for the High Frequency Global Communications System (HFGCS)
Puerto Rico Station (PRS).     The period of performance will cover a one-year base period (Aug 08 to Jul 09) with four, one-year options. The government expects to make an award on or about 29 Aug 08. This acquisition will be issued as a Request For Proposal (RFP) on or about 7 Apr 08. Please note this is an estimated post time and it is the responsibility of interested contractors to monitor Fed Biz Opps for all subsequent postings. Please e-mail Lt Edgar A. Alonso-Bernal to request a copy of the Performance Work Statement (PWS). The predecessor contract for the HFGCS services was awarded as full and open. The Government seeks industry input to determine if this acquisition should be set-aside for a particular socio-economic small business concern under the auspices of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 19 or remain full and open.     The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this requirement is 237130 Power and Communication Line and Related Structures Construction. Interested small businesses who are certified and qualified as a small business concern in NAICS 237130 shall submit a package outlining their capabilities in key areas as determined by the government as relevant to the performance of this requirement.     These companies are encouraged to respond and submit their capability statement(s) to this office NLT COB on 11 March 08. Please address the following five (5) small business criteria:

1:     Do you intend to bid as a prime contractor on this effort, and can your company perform 51 percent of the required estimated labor dollars involved?     

2:     Statement that your company is certified and qualifies as a small business concern in North American Industrial Classification System Code (NAICS) 237130, which has a small business threshold of $31 million. Also, if applicable, specify socio-economic size status (HUBzone, 8a, SDVOSB, etc) 

3:     Degree of experience in providing same or similar services to include past corporate and Government contracts with current references and points of contact.

<DESC>15 CONS is seeking the interest of potential and eligible contractors in an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Design/Build Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) at Hickam AFB, Bellows AFB, and other installations throughout the Hawaiian Islands.   Responses are due no later than 5 January 2008.  

The MACC is a contract for execution of a broad range of maintenance, repair and minor construction and may include design.  Work to be performed under the MACC will be within the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes as follows: Sector 23 ? Construction, Subsection 233 ? Building Development and General Contracting ? size standard $31 Million (except dredging and surface cleanup activities;  Subsector 234 ? Heavy Construction ? size standard $13 Million and Subsector 235 ? Special Trade Contractors ? Size standard $13 Million. Contractors will be expected to accomplish a wide variety of individual construction tasks, including design/build, renovation, additions/upgrades, along with specific work in Heating/Ventilation/Air Conditioning, electrical, mechanical and other major trades. 

Description of the work will be identified in each individual task order.  Anticipated individual task orders may range from $2,500 - $4,000,000.  The program value is still under consideration, but at this point in time, the program is expected Not-to-Exceed $60,000,000 over a five-year period.  Each contract awarded will contain a basic 12-month period and four 12-month option periods.  The number of awards the government will award is still under consideration, however at this point in time the government anticipates awarding 5 contracts. The government will evaluate offers and select the awardees utilizing the best value source selection procedures described in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR Part 15.3) and Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS 5315.3).  In using this best value approach, the government seeks to award to those offerors who give the Air Force the greatest confidence they will best meet our requirements affordably.  While the government source selection evaluation team and the source selection authority will strive for maximum objectivity, the source selection process, by its nature, is subjective.  This may result in an award being made to higher rated, higher priced offerors where the decision is consistent with the evaluation factors in the RFP and the selection authority reasonably determines that the technical superiority, and/or overall business approach, and/or superior past performance, of higher priced offerors outweighs the cost difference. The RFP may identify a seed project, which will be awarded to the highest rated offeror for the first award.  All other successful awardees are guaranteed a minimum of $2,500.  The government will compete future individual requirements among the awardees.  

This acquisition is being considered for Section 8(a) set-aside, partial HUBZone set-aside, unrestricted competition, or a combination of these. 

In responding to this sources sought synopsis, please indicate your (a) interest as a prime contractor, teaming partner, joint venture, primary subcontractor and indicate (b) if your business is 8(a) and/or HUBZone certified, large, or small, (c) provide evidence of recent (within three (3) years), relevant (multiple trade, multiple task order) experience in work similar in type and scope to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, and points of contact with telephone numbers and a statement as to why the project is relevant, and (d) availability of bonding of at least $10,000,000 (maximum anticipated for each performance period) for this project. An actual solicitation is expected to be issued March 2008.  

The closing date and time for submission of offers will be contained in the solicitation package. The entire solicitation, including the specifications and drawings, will be made available only on the Electronic Posting System (EPS) Web Site at http://www.eps.gov at that time.  Potential offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation package and any other pertinent information and for downloading their own copy of the solicitation package. Potential offerors MUST register at www.eps.gov./ in order to receive notification and/or changes to the solicitation. All contractors MUST be registered in the Central Contractor Registration database or their proposal will not be considered. Contractors can obtain further information on the Central Contractor registration (CCR) at web site http://www.ccr.gov. Prospective offerors who would like their company name included on the Bidders Mailing List (planholder's list) may do so on the fedbizopps website under IVL (Interested Vendor?s List). This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or multiple contracts nor does it obligate the Government to pay for any bid/proposal preparation costs.

For other opportunities and information go to the small business administration web site at http://www.sba.gov., or contact our small business specialist James.Watanabe@Hickam.af.mil.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR 15.201 - Exchanges with Industry before Receipt of Proposals, this is a Request for Information (RFI) and not a Request for Quotation (RFQ) or Request for Proposal (RFP).  The purpose of this RFI is to request information from industry relating to a paper-based 360 degree instrument, individual reports and developmental materials for the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Federal Executive Institute (FEI).  FEI intends to use the responses to the RFI as market research to determine if this requirement should be reserved for small business.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(a), "Any exchange of information must be consistent with procurement integrity requirements (FAR 3.104)". The FAR may be viewed at: http://www.arnet.gov/far/.  Your capability statement must be submitted via email to: dorsey.delavigne@opm.gov no later than 3:00pm local time on March 17, 2008.

The FEI is the Federal government?s premier leadership education center.  Since 1968 FEI has operated executive education programs for GS-15s and members of the Senior Executive Service (SES).  At present, these programs include a four-week Leadership for a Democratic Society (LDS) program, offered ten times per year, and a variety of open-enrollment and custom-designed programs through FEI?s Center for Organizational Performance (COP).

FEI uses 360 degree leadership skills assessment instruments in both LDS and COP programs.  In each of the ten LDS programs, approximately 70 participants complete a 360 skills assessment that includes feedback from his/her boss, direct reports, and coworkers, as well as a self-assessment. The assessment results are used in coaching participants and in their selection of courses to take within LDS and/or COP programs.  In COP programs, a 360 instrument is generally used when a client agency wishes to do such an assessment in a custom-designed program.

Small businesses must describe their capability to provide the following services: (1) an off-the-shelf 360 degree leadership skills assessment instrument for use in FEI programs, (2) a report on the assessment for each program participant; (3) collect data across the administrations of the instrument at FEI; and (4) provide access to this group 360 data for analyses either by the contractor or by FEI staff. In addition, the instrument(s) should be researched based, statistically valid and reliable.  The contractor must have at least 15 years of experience in the administration, delivery, conduct and interpretation of 360 degree assessments.  
 
The contractor staff should have extensive educational background and experience in Executive Leadership training and development.  

Specifically, FEI must have an instrument and associated report that meet the following specifications:

1.	Your instrument must measure at least the following leadership competencies (see Appendix A for definitions of competencies) specified as critical for senior executives by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM):

a.	Conflict Management
b.	Continual Learning
c.	Delegation
d.	External Awareness
e.	Flexibility
f.	Influencing/Negotiating
g.	Integrity/Honesty
h.	Interpersonal Skills
i.	Leveraging Diversity
j.	Political Savvy
k.	Strategic Thinking
l.	Team Development
m.	Technical Credibility
n.	Vision

2.	Your instrument must provide for the collection of data and feedback in an assessment report that includes the self, your immediate boss, peers and direct reports.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/National Weather Service (NWS) intends to establish a qualification requirement in the form of a Qualified Products List (QPL) for Fischer and Porter/Belfort Precipitation Gauge Rebuild Kits (FPR kits).  This qualification opportunity is open to all interested parties.  However, potential applicants are advised that the Government expects that at least two small businesses will successfully qualify their FPR kits; should this prove to be the case, the Government anticipates that all acquisitions from this QPL will be small business set-asides.  The FPR kits to be qualified fall under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 334519; hence, the relevant small business size standard is 500 employees.  The specification which the FPR kits must meet is Specification No. NWS-D111-5-SP001.  Interested parties desiring to qualify their FPR kits may obtain a copy of this specification by contacting the NWS Acquisition Division (Attention:  Ed Tennant) at U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA, 1325 East-West Highway, Station 17372, Silver Spring, Maryland  20910 or by monitoring the website at which the present notice is posted.  It is expected that Specification No. NWS-D111-5-SP001 will be uploaded to this website on or about March 6, 2008.  The anticipated date that NOAA will begin awarding contracts subject to the qualification requirement is September 10, 2008.  Notice is hereby provided that the Government will not commence its verification portion of the qualification testing process until the applicant has provided the required number of FPR kits and all of the documentation that Specification No. NWS-D111-5-SP001 requires it to provide during the Qualification Test Phase.  Once the applicant has provided these required FPR kits and documentation, NOAA expects that it will complete the Government Verification portion of qualification testing and notify the applicant whether its product passed or failed within sixty days.  Applicants which desire to compete for the first award from this QPL (which, as noted above, is anticipated to take place on September 10, 2008) are cautioned to deliver their required FPR kits and documentation sufficiently early to allow the Government at least 60 days to complete the Government Verification portion of qualification testing.  The attention of all applicants is directed to the requirement in Section 3.9 of Specification No. NWS-D111-5-SP001 that the FPR kits used and provided to the Government during the Qualification Test Phase shall have been built on the production line.  For the information of potential applicants, the Government intends to upgrade approximately 2,000 to 2,200 Fischer and Porter/Belfort Precipitation Gauges by retrofitting them with qualified FPR kits over the next approximately seven years.  The Government will be responsible for field installations.

<DESC>65-Medical Supplies-Potential Sources Sought<BR>---------------<BR>A.	 General Information<BR><BR>The Pacific Region-TRBO Region 12, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 18 Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps medical treatment fac ilities in Hawaii, Guam, Japan, Okinawa, and Korea announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Safety Needles. <BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across  the region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price. It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the Department of Defense Prime Vendor Program.<BR> <BR>The major facilities in the region include Tripler Army Medical Center, U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa, U.S. Naval Hospital Guam, U.S. Naval Hospital Yokosuka, 121st Combat Support Hospital Seoul, 374th Medical Group, Yokota AB, and 18th Medical Group Kad ena AB.<BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel. In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and P ricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program. This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This  RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program, please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement ( RIA) will be for a base period of two years (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods. Anticipated selection date is November 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. The selection will be determine d utilizing Best value/ trade off criteria. The selection of a single vendor is anticipated. However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, The Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs. In this event , selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability. <BR><BR>Point of Contact<BR>Susan Hwang, TRBO Team Leader<BR>808-433-3686, susan.hwang@amedd.army.mil<BR><BR>Cheryl Janus, RN, TRBO Clinical Analyst<BR>808-433-7985, ch eryl.janus@amedd.army.mil<BR>   <BR>B.	Products & Performance Required<BR><BR>The Pacific Region is seeking product line items in the category of Safety Needles, which at a minimum includes the high volume line items below. Within this region, this product  line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $126,120. This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period. The top high volume usage lines for this project include are listed in the technical/company criteria.<BR ><BR>At the request of the Pacific Region Military Treatment Facilities, vendors will provide educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types, and pac kaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors<BR><BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number,  Fax Number, and E-mail address) to susan.hwang@amedd.army.mil AND cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil. Submissions must be received by 4:00 p.m. Hawaii Standard Time ( HST) on the specified closing date/time of this solicitation. Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will result be disqualified from participating.  <BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to techni cal criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, product literature, education and training materials, and submission of electronic best price quotes. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors ar e strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC stated above that their initial submission, quotes, and literature or other requested information has actually arrived at the Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via email. Each submitting vend or is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  <BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria<BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Pacific Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative. <BR> <BR>The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical an d/or company questions listed in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Pacific Region). Add itionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary. If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number tha t will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>Phase I: Technical/Company Evaluation Process<BR>Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by e-mailing their intent to participate to the above POC by the required response da te. Based on vendor responses, the TRBO POC will request detailed responses to the technical/company criteria from each vendor. Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below. All technical/company criteria ar e weighted equally. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB to determine the acceptability of each vendor. After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participa te in the clinical/performance evaluation.<BR><BR>Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally, responses to all questions in this section demonstrate:  (1) the business concern submitting the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the commun ity, applicable to such products or services; (3) the vendor has or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified); (4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items with Cardinal Health, the Pr ime Vendor for the region (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified); (5) the vendor intends to provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provi de a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and (6) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqua lify the vendor from further consideration.<BR><BR>The following Technical/Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR><BR>1.	Vendor must manufacture and/or distribute a complete product line of Safety Needles. A comp lete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line. Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. Provide certification of all brands of this product line that you manufacturer or distribute with the initial submittal. At a minimum, the following items are required: Safety Needle 18 gauge 1 ? inch, Safety Needle 25 gauge 1 inch, and Safety Needl e 23 gauge 1 inch.<BR>2.	Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Safety Needles product line. Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal. (Note that vendors that fail t o have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified).<BR>3.	Vendors must have a separate agreement with the regional prime vendor Cardinal Health for distribution in this Region and provide certification of this with the initi al submittal. (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified). <BR>4.	Vendors must provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where lower FSS prices are availab le, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as their DAPA price. Therefore, FSS prices do not represent a discount off DAPA. (Note that vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified).<BR>5.	Vendor m ust provide educational tools, product literature, and materials for Safety Needles as well as no cost samples for the evaluation. Describe your available company educational tools and material resources with the initial submittal.<BR>6.	Vendor must provid e customer service (telephonic and e-mail) for regional facilities. Identify company resources and capabilities for such support with the initial submittal.<BR>7.	Vendors product line must be latex free and indicated on the packaging and in the product li terature. <BR>8.	Vendor will provide a product and packaging which clearly displays the size of the device.<BR><BR>Phase II: Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process<BR>The multi-disciplinary TPRB Clinical Team will request samples (no charge) from the prod uct line to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities. Vendors are required to ship their no cost samples directly to the designated MTFs and will be allowed 21 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery. Sam ples must be shipped to arrive at the MTF by COB, 4:00 p.m. local time, on the (21st ) calendar day after the notice to ship. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. <BR><BR >Specific MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert scale, with a one to five rating. One (1) = strongly disagree, Two (2) = disagree, Three (3) = neutral, Four (4) = agree, and Five (5) = strongly agree. All clinical/performance criteria are equally weighted. <BR><BR>To determine acceptability, the TPRB Clinical Team comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below. The TPRB Clinical Team intends to cond uct the clinical evaluation in a clinical and/or non-clinical The Government reserves the right to conduct evaluations in either a non-clinical or clinical setting or both. <BR><BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been establishe d for this standardization initiative:<BR><BR>1.	Safety mechanism is easily activated using only one hand.(The mechanism lever or switch or shield can be pushed  or pulled or pressed easily by one hand  two hands are not necessary to activate the safety mechanism)<BR>2.	The safety mechanism cannot be activated passively.(The mechanism remains inactivated when holding or grasping or using device to perform a venap uncture)<BR>3.	Once the safety mechanism is activated, no part of the needle is accessible. (The cover or shield covers the entire needle)<BR>4.	Once the safety mechanism is activated, the device cannot be reused. (The cover or shield leaves the device wit h no ability to uncover the needle and reuse the needle)<BR>5.	Product is compatible with luer-loc and slip tip syringes, regardless of manufacturer. (The hub of the safety needle will connect with a luer-loc and slip tip syringe).<BR><BR>Phase III: Pricin g Analysis Process<BR><BR>After the clinical/performance evaluation is completed and analyzed, all vendors who participated in the clinical/performance evaluation will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference d ata) based on committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirement. Vendors will be provided seven calendar days to submit their price quotes in a prescribed format via email. Price quotes must be received by 4:00 p.m. Hawaii Standard Time (HST) 7th c alendar day. Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation. The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a  vendor or vendor(s), without discussions as noted above. However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if determined to be necessary. <BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period wit h possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years). The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines , and (4) Consideration of stockage keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor. Due to the potential for Base DAPA prices to be inflated, the Impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than other pricing elements.  <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>

<DESC>65-Medical Supplies-Potential Sources Sought<BR>---------------<BR>A.	 General Information<BR><BR>The Pacific Region-TRBO Region 12, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 18 Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps medical treatment fac ilities in Hawaii, Guam, Japan, Okinawa, and Korea announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Safety Needle and Syringe Combination. <BR><BR>The primary objective of this standardization initiative is  to achieve a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source at the best possible price. It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the Department of Defense Prime Vendor Program.<BR><BR>The major  facilities in the region include Tripler Army Medical Center, U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa, U.S. Naval Hospital Guam, U.S. Naval Hospital Yokosuka, 121st Combat Support Hospital Seoul, 374th Medical Group, Yokota AB, and 18th Medical Group Kadena AB.<BR><B R>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel. In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreem ent (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a  supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<BR><BR>The agreement will be for a base period of two years (24 m onths) from date of award with three 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is November 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The award will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade off criteria.<BR><BR>P oint of Contact:<BR>Susan Hwang, TRBO Team Leader<BR>808-433-3686, susan.hwang@amedd.army.mil<BR><BR>Cheryl Janus, RN, TRBO Clinical Analyst<BR>808-433-7985, Cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil<BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required<BR><BR>The Pacific Region is  seeking product line items in the category of Safety Needle and Syringe Combination. For this product line, the yearly estimated total usage/forecasted requirement for this region is $146,437. This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales for a 12-month period. <BR><BR>At the request of the Pacific Region Military Treatment Facilities, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brand s, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors<BR><BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name an d Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to susan.hwang@amedd.army.mil AND cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil. Submissions must be received prior to the specified closing date/time of this solicitation. Failure to meet the submittal deadline will result in  exclusion.  <BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, product literature, education and training materials, and submission of electronic best price offer s. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC that their initial submission, quote, and literature actually arrived at the Region via email. Each s ubmitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submissi on.  <BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria<BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Pacific Region.  They are the deciding officials for this initiative. <BR><BR>The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requ ested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the Vendor's DAPA pri cing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Pacific Region). Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary. If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>Phase I: <BR>Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteri a. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB to determine acceptability. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be invited to partic ipate in the clinical/performance evaluation.<BR><BR>Phase II: <BR>The TPRB will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the designated  MTFs.  Vendors will be given 15 business days to ship samples. Samples must be shipped to arrive at the MTF by COB, 4PM local time, on the (15th) business day after the notice to ship. Failure to deliver samples by the requested deadline will result in ex clusion from the standardization process.<BR><BR>Specific MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert type scale, using a one to five rating. The scale descriptors are: One (1) = not acceptable, Three (3) = acceptable, and Five (5) = highly acceptable. All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. The Government reserves the right to conduct evaluations in either a non-clinical or clinical setting or both. <BR><BR>Phase III: <BR>After the clinical/performance evaluation are  completed and analyzed, all vendors will be asked to submit their best pricing offer based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Pacific Region.<BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted m ore heavily than price. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years). Failure to offer a discount off the DAPA pr ice will result in exclusion from the standardization process.<BR><BR>1. Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation<BR>The TPRB will review the following technical criteria responses from each vendor and determine acceptability. Acceptability for purposes of ev aluation of technical/company criteria: Generally responses to all questions in this section demonstrate that: 1) the business concern offering the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; 2) ba sed on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services offered meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; 3) the vendor has, or is obtaining a DA PA for the items; 4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items, with Cardinal Health, the Prime Vendor for the region; 5) the vendor inte nds to offer discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to offer a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and 6) the vendors information provided is factually correct (any misrepresentation of inf ormation will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.)<BR><BR>1.	Vendor must manufacture and/or distribute a complete product line of Safety Needle and Syringe Combination Device. A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements f or usage items in the product line. Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. Provide certification of all brands of this product line that you manufacturer or distribute with the initial submittal. At a minimum, the following item are required: 3cc syringe with a 21 gauge, 1 inch needle.<BR>2.	Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Safety  Needle and Syringe Combination Device product line. Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal. (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified).<B R>3.	Vendors must have a separate agreement with the regional prime vendor Cardinal Health for distribution in this Region and provide certification of this with the initial submittal. (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regiona l PV will be disqualified).<BR>4.	Vendors must provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as their DAPA price. Therefore, FSS prices do not represent a discount off DAPA. (Note that vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified).<BR>5.	Vendor must provide educational tools, product literature, and materials for Safety Needle and  Syringe Combination Device as well as no cost samples for the evaluation. Describe your available company educational tools and material resources with the initial submittal.<BR>6.	Vendor must provide customer service (telephonic and e-mail) for regional facilities. Identify company resources and capabilities for such support with the initial submittal.<BR>7.	Vendor will provide a product, which is clearly marked as to the size of the syringe and the length and gauge of the attached needle. Provide specifi c information whether this information is provided on the device, or on the packaging, or on both.<BR><BR>2. Clinical/Performance Criteria:<BR>1.	The product is clearly and easily identified from either the device or the packaging. (The cc/ml volume of syr inge and the length and gauge of the needle are easily identified)	<BR><BR>2.	The millimeter (cc) markings on syringe barrel are clear and distinct.(Incremental marks are either impregnated into the plastic of the barrel and/or color with black ink to prov ide clear and distinct visualization)<BR>3.	Product fits comfortably in either hand. (Product is not bulky, no sharp edges)<BR>4.	Safety mechanism is activated using only one hand. (The trigger, lever or tab which activates safety mechanism is easily pushe d, pulled or pressed using one hand)<BR>5.	Once the safety mechanism is activated, no part of the needle is accessible. (Once activated, the cover, sheath or sleeve covers entire needle and cannot be removed; avoiding  potential for reuse)<BR><BR>

<SUBJECT>70 -- INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE AND BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE AND BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION


In accordance with FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(ii), the Federal Systems Integration and Management Center (FEDSIM) announce its intentions to award a sole source award under the Commercial Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) with Navini Networks, 2240 Campbell Creek Boulevard, Richardson, Texas, 75082-4432.  The statement of work for this effort can be obtained via email to millicent.hawkins@gsa.gov.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION OR A REQUEST FOR OFFERS. This is a Notice of Intent. 

Brand Name Justification-This procurement will also be awarded in accordance with FAR authority FAR 6.302-1.

Reason for citing authority:  

US Agency for International Development (USAID) is working on the Colombia project to improve Internet and voice communication among rural isolated areas in Colombia using WiMax and Voice over IP (VoIP) technologies. USAID is implementing this technology for a total of 17 Departments in the Colombia region, and this procurement is for the final 3. A Navini Networks was chosen by USAID to implement the WiMax and VoIP setup.  For the remaining 3 Departments to communicate effectively within the WiMax setup, the same Management Software Operating system and configured hardware must be used.  If another carrier were to be used, these units would be frozen out of the system.  WiMax technologies cannot be handed off between carriers. Signals, Data Transmissions and phone calls would be dropped as signals would not pass over. By using another carrier, a second Management Software Operating system with specific base stations would need to be implemented within the WiMax configuration.  Navini Networks has been identified as the only one responsible source to satisfy this require.

Interested parties may identify their capability to respond to this requirement. All inquiries must be addressed in writing to Ms. Millicent Hawkins, Contract Specialist, General Services Administration FEDSIM Civilian Acquisition 6354 Walker Lane, Alexandria, VA 22310 or via email at millicent.hawkins@gsa.gov.

Note: The used carpet and cove base will be disposed of by the Contractor. See paragraph 3.7 (Task 7) below.
3.1.4 Carpet Options:  Replacement carpet must meet industry standard of using 30% recycled material, meet specifications for heavy foot and wheelchair traffic, and be visually similar to the existing carpet (Mohawk Conqueror 22oz. Terra Earthen), installed in the adjoining hallways.  The pile/height/texture of the replacement carpet shall create a level surface between the offices and the adjoining hallways so as to prevent injury which could be caused from foot traffic entering/exiting the hallway and adjoining offices. Offerors are required to provide a two foot by three foot sample (or equivalent grade sample) to the government point of contact, Sam Pratton, at the address shown in paragraph 8 below.  All samples must be sent postage prepaid and must arrive on or before the scheduled closing date/time of the solicitation. Replacement cove base must be 4? vinyl, black.  
3.2. (Task 2) Moving or Lifting Furniture/other floor objects from each office.  Lifting of furniture with a furniture lift and/or moving furniture, in office spaces, will not begin until the Government has removed all computer equipment.  The Contractor will remove or lift all furniture, to include all objects occupying floor space, in each office space, in advance of removal of existing carpet/cove base.  If furniture is removed, the furniture must be moved to an area where carpet/cove base is not being installed.  The Government will determine the area that will be used to store the office furniture while the carpet/cove base is removed and new carpet/cove base is installed.  Desks, filing cabinets, storage cabinets and bookcases will not be unloaded since a desk mover, which will be furnished by the Government, will be utilized.  If furniture lifting rather than moving furniture is done, the Contractor will furnish the furniture lift.  Furniture moves will be performed Monday through Friday between 0700 to 1800; Saturday and Sunday between the hours of 0700 to 1800.  
3.3. (Task 3) Existing carpet/cove de-installation.  After all computer equipment has been removed by Government personnel and all furniture/objects that occupy floor space have been removed or lifted, with a furniture lifter, by the Contractor, the Contractor will remove (de-install in advance of scheduled new carpet/cove base installation) old carpet and old base cove from each office space.  The Contractor will take the old carpet and old base cove to a staging area, determined by the Government.
3.4. (Task 4) Carpet/Cove Base Installation Schedule.  The final installation schedule will be arranged at an on-site meeting with the vendor to be held at Bldg. 801, Saufley Field, within 5 days of contract award.  Since workers will be present, the installation schedule will be performed in a phased approach to minimize disruption to the workers.  Installation will be performed Monday through Friday between the hours of 0700 to 1800; Saturday and Sunday between the hours of 0700 to 1800.  
Note: there are no elevators in Bldg. 801.  Carpet/cove base for 2nd deck office spaces will need to be transported via stairway.  
3.5 (Task 5) Carpet/Cove Base installation must be performed under the guidance and supervision of a certified carpet installer.  Seam edges must be cut with appropriate tools based on carpet manufacturer recommendations.  To eliminate possible height variation at the seam, a sufficient amount of the factory edge or selvage must be trimmed.  Cut edges at seams must be sealed with proper seam adhesive applied as recommended by the carpet or adhesive manufacturer.  Rolling of installed carpet must be accomplished according to manufacturer recommendations.  
3.6 (Task 6) Furniture Move Back into Office and/or Lower Furniture on a Furniture Lift.  Furniture and other floor objects will be moved back into the office or lowered with the furniture lift by the Contractor, after carpet/cove base installation has been completed for that office.  However, if the carpet manufacturer has suggested a wait time before returning furniture/objects or lowering furniture/objects onto the newly installed carpet, the move or lowering of furniture/objects will not occur until after this period of time.  The Government will provide oversight regarding the correct placement of all furniture/ objects returning to the office which has replaced and installed carpet/cove base. Replacement of computer equipment will be done by the Government.  Furniture moves will be performed Monday through Friday between 0700 to 1800; Saturday and Sunday between the hours of 0700 to 1800.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011. Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit quotations that will be considered by the agency.  Quotations should be written and submitted in a legible format.  Submitted quotes shall have the contractor?s Tax Information Number, and DUNS Number.

<DESC>1.  Title:  VA Patient Food Safety and Defense Program 2.  Solicitation Reference Number:  VA-101-08-RQ-0126 3.  Description:  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Responses reflecting availability of the service as described are requested in the form of a written technical and price quotation.  This solicitation is being issued as a request for quotation (RFQ) and is a total Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business set-aside.  The NAICS code is 541690 (Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services) with a small business size standard $6.5M. All responsible sources may submit a quotation that, if timely received, shall be considered by the agency. Questions in response to this solicitation are due Wednesday, March 12, 2008 NLT 4:00 PM EST. The due date for quotations is Friday, March 21, 2008 at 4:00 PM EST.  Quotations shall be submitted electronically via email to Shaundra J. Duggans at shaundra.duggans@va.gov. The solicitation title and reference number shall be included in the subject line of ALL correspondence. 4. Statement of Work:  (As a result of character limitations, only an excerpt of the Statement of Work (SOW) has been provided. Interested Offerors shall contact Shaundra J. Duggans via email for copies of the SOW. Telephone requests will NOT be accepted.) Food services within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) are provided by several entities, including Nutrition and Food Services (NFS), Veterans Canteen Service (VCS), and in some cases other government or private contract entities.  Nutrition and Food Services provides food service to patients and their policies apply to foods served to patients.   Veterans Canteen Service provides food service to patients, staff, and visitors.  Increased globalization of food suppliers, global economic pressures and the threat of food-related bioterrorism present challenges to which the VA must respond to ensure the agency is adequately prepared to mitigate or respond to potential threats or to potential large-scale, regional or national patient food-borne illness. To address such concerns, NFS is enlisting Contractor support to conduct a Vulnerability Assessment and Comprehensive GAP Analysis. The primary purpose of the assessment and analysis is to insure that only high-quality safe food is served to patients and that these national level policies appropriately address VA's capability to anticipate any internal or external threat of tampering and/or the possibility of a terrorist attack on its foodservices; and the likelihood of threats from globalization of food suppliers.  The assessment and analysis shall evaluate the VA's preparedness and ability to provide mitigation strategies to either thwart an attack, or at the very least, mitigate the damage; to appropriately care for and monitor effected patients to recover from the economic and psychological impact of an attack; and to respond to potential large-scale, regional or national food-borne illnesses.   The Vulnerability Assessment and Gap Analysis shall result in a report that contains summary findings for management review; highlights of systems already in place; recommendations from other best practices or industry standards; a list of items that may need to be implemented and notes on practices; documentation and other observations to assist the department in closing any gaps identified. The Contractor shall provide the necessary resources to conduct a Vulnerability Assessment and Comprehensive Gap Analysis as follows: (2)	Vulnerability Assessment of the Department's susceptibility of patient food service resources to negative impacts from hazard events; either internal, external or both;     (2)	Comprehensive Gap Analysis of existing VA national Nutrition and Food Services policies including food recall process, national subsistence prime vendor contract and selected VISN 5 facility food safety policy and emergency preparedness policy that address food safety and security of food supply to patientsýýý 5.

PHONE NUMBER:  817 978-2684
PROJECT: New Construction & Repair and Alterations
PROJECT TYPE:   Various
CLIENT AGENCY: Department of Homeland Security
SIZE: BUDGET: Varied
GEOGRAPHIC LIMITATION:  
Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation?s most talented architects, landscape architects, interior designers, and engineers to plan and design new or expanded Federal facilities as well as repair and alterations of facilities to provide outstanding quality, value and operational design.  Projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for Federal employees.
In this context, The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design Services for Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements. As required by law, all facilities will meet Federal Energy Goals and security requirements and the facility will be designed in metric units. All new facility designs will be LEED certified, and shall be designed to meet the Silver standard as defined in the U.S. Green Buildings Council in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System to the extent the budget allows. 

Projects will be varied, including renovations, expansions or new facilities.  Expedited design and delivery approaches will be promoted, including prototype design, prefabricated and modular construction, and use of pre-designed components.  Thought should be given to the most appropriate and cost effective construction materials; and design, construction, and delivery methods suitable to the project.  Various project delivery methods, including traditional design and construction, and bridging-design-build, will be used. 

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This is a solicitation for A/E services for a period of one year with four additional one-year option periods.  Firms are not required to be geographically located in the State where the project is located, and are not required to have an active design production office within the State to be considered for award; however, successful A/E firms will be required to be licensed/registered within the State prior to the award of task order for a specific project and shall conform to all laws, rules, and requirements of that state governing the profession of architecture or engineering.  Multiple awards are expected to be made for each of the primary services areas (zones) as follows:  
Zone 1: California, Arizona, Montana, Idaho, Washington, Alaska
Zone 2:  New Mexico and Texas
Zone 3:  North Dakota, Minnesota, Michigan, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine.
Secondary service areas will include the contiguous United States.
The selected A/E firm shall primarily provide design services, including feasibility studies, bridging documents (35% construction documents), and full design and construction services, and research and reports related to the design of Federal facilities.  The final designs may be operationally complex and technologically sophisticated site and civil-intensive projects with a balance between aesthetic, functional, and security issues, including state-of-the-art data and telecommunications systems, compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and other requirements.  Awardees under this requirement will not be eligible for award (individually or as a team member) on any design build projects resulting from work under any contract awarded under this requirement.

SCOPE OF WORK
The scope of professional services may require: problem analysis, feasibility studies, energy analysis, life cycle costing, building information modeling, surveys, site and existing conditions surveys, design, planning, interior design, traffic and civil engineering, and estimating services for new construction, and repair and alteration projects. At times the contract may also require selected firms to provide civil engineering, boundary and topographical surveying, sustainable design, environmental studies, quality control testing, asbestos sampling/hazard assessment/ abatement design, historic structure reports, building evaluation reports, scope development, construction management, and other architectural, engineering and technical services. New construction may be up to approximately 50% site work and require extensive civil, traffic, environmental, signage and environmental graphics, as well as primarily architectural, landscape architectural, interior design, mechanical, electrical, structural services, and cost estimating, but may also necessitate geotechnical, fire safety, elevator, acoustical, lighting, historic preservation, construction management/inspection, surveyor and other disciplines with specialized experience. The selected A/E firms may be required to provide design services that include alternative energy, prefabrication or modular construction, and/or expedited design and delivery solutions.  The selected A/E firms may be required to participate in peer review processes. A/E?s may be required to develop prototypical designs, and the Government reserves the right to go back to the architects to modify and site adapt for any and all locations throughout the life of the contract.  All facilities will be designed in metric units. There will be no limit on the amount paid on individual delivery orders and no limit on project size; however the total cumulative delivery order amount shall not exceed $12 million in any one contract period, and the minimum guaranteed contract amount is $1000 for the base year and each of the option years, if exercised. Firm-fixed price indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contracts will result from this solicitation, including profit, overhead and hourly rates for anticipated disciplines and for use in negotiating firm-fixed price delivery orders. A supplemental architect-engineer lookup table for pricing delivery orders design services for projects with an estimate construction cost of less than $2 million will be included in the contract.  All design services will be in accordance with GSA requirements, design guides, and standards.  The design of new and renovation projects at ports of entry is an example of the design programs GSA anticipates ordering under this contract.

3.  TASKINGS/REQUIREMENTS
3.1  (Task 1) The contractor will provide new, commercial, replacement carpet and new 4? vinyl cove base for 45 office spaces in Bldg. 801, Saufley Field, Pensacola, FL.  Replacement carpet in each office shall be of identical construction specifications, e.g., type and color method. List of offices spaces attached.  
3.1.1 Estimated room size:  18? X 20?.
      Estimated Sq. Yards of Carpet Required:  2,188
      Estimated Linear Feet of 4? Vinyl Cove Base:  3,872
3.1.2 Traffic: Heavy foot traffic.  Wheelchair traffic.  
3.1.3 Furniture/equipment:  Office furniture will be removed (taken out) by the Contractor in advance of replacement carpet installation.  The Contractor may use a furniture lift to lift office furniture in combination with moving office furniture.  Computer equipment will be removed by the Government before furniture is lifted and/or moved.  The existing carpet and cove base in each room will be removed (taken-out) by the Contractor. Note: The used carpet and cove base will be disposed of by the Contractor. See paragraph 3.7 (Task 7) below.
3.1.4 Carpet Options:  Replacement carpet must meet industry standard of using 30% recycled material, meet specifications for heavy foot and wheelchair traffic, and be visually similar to the existing carpet (Mohawk Conqueror 22oz. Terra Earthen), installed in the adjoining hallways.  The pile/height/texture of the replacement carpet shall create a level surface between the offices and the adjoining hallways so as to prevent injury which could be caused from foot traffic entering/exiting the hallway and adjoining offices. Offerors are required to provide a two foot by three foot sample (or equivalent grade sample) to the government point of contact, Sam Pratton, at the address shown in paragraph 8 below.  All samples must be sent postage prepaid and must arrive on or before the scheduled closing date/time of the solicitation. Replacement cove base must be 4? vinyl, black.  
3.2. (Task 2) Moving or Lifting Furniture/other floor objects from each office.  Lifting of furniture with a furniture lift and/or moving furniture, in office spaces, will not begin until the Government has removed all computer equipment.  The Contractor will remove or lift all furniture, to include all objects occupying floor space, in each office space, in advance of removal of existing carpet/cove base.  If furniture is removed, the furniture must be moved to an area where carpet/cove base is not being installed.  The Government will determine the area that will be used to store the office furniture while the carpet/cove base is removed and new carpet/cove base is installed.  Desks, filing cabinets, storage cabinets and bookcases will not be unloaded since a desk mover, which will be furnished by the Government, will be utilized.  If furniture lifting rather than moving furniture is done, the Contractor will furnish the furniture lift.  Furniture moves will be performed Monday through Friday between 0700 to 1800; Saturday and Sunday between the hours of 0700 to 1800.  
3.3. (Task 3) Existing carpet/cove de-installation.  After all computer equipment has been removed by Government personnel and all furniture/objects that occupy floor space have been removed or lifted, with a furniture lifter, by the Contractor, the Contractor will remove (de-install in advance of scheduled new carpet/cove base installation) old carpet and old base cove from each office space.  The Contractor will take the old carpet and old base cove to a staging area, determined by the Government.
3.4. (Task 4) Carpet/Cove Base Installation Schedule.  The final installation schedule will be arranged at an on-site meeting with the vendor to be held at Bldg. 801, Saufley Field, within 5 days of contract award.  Since workers will be present, the installation schedule will be performed in a phased approach to minimize disruption to the workers.  Installation will be performed Monday through Friday between the hours of 0700 to 1800; Saturday and Sunday between the hours of 0700 to 1800.  
Note: there are no elevators in Bldg. 801.  Carpet/cove base for 2nd deck office spaces will need to be transported via stairway.  
3.5 (Task 5) Carpet/Cove Base installation must be performed under the guidance and supervision of a certified carpet installer.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to post a second set of Questions and Answers pertaining to this requirement.

February 15, 2008
Second set of Questions and Answers to Solicitation number M00146-08-T-N044

Q1. With respect to providing a compact, portable vacuum that can fit well within the 30-inch width constraint outlined in your last response, can the Government accept our standard 23-gallo drawer mounted drum (drum slides out from beneath the vacuum head), rather than limiting the volume to the 16-gallon spec? In either case, the limit of 1# of aluminum dust accumulation will result in drum removal prior to its filling.

Answer: No.  As stated in paragraph 2.ee. of the Essential Characteristics the vacuum dust storage bin capacity shall be no less than 3 gallons and no greater than 16 gallons.

Q2: We offer an optional drum level detection system that can be indicate either drum weight or drum fill level. Does the Government have any interest in an integrated drum level detection system?

Answer: No.

Q3: We offer our units will mutliple ports to support the simultaneous operation of multiple hoses of various lengths. Our standard flow rates are 70% greater than the minimum flow rates specified at the various vacuum levels to support this feature. And our standard filter area is 200% times the minimum 80SF specified. As a consequence, maximum hose lengths exceed those set forth in the manifold descriptors (e.g., Section 2.3 of the specification) by very wide margins (at least 200 ft.). 

Our question is this: Can the government accept deployment of a portable HEPA vacuum system capable of simultaneous supporting up to 6 hoses of various lengths up to 200 ft. as an alternative to the hard-tubed, segmented vacuum manifold and hose combinations described in the specification?

Answer: No.

Questions and Answers to Solicitation number M00146-08-T-N044

Q1: Can you inform me of the specific make and model number (catalogue reference preferred) so that we may perform a closer examination of the capabilities and functionality you seek?

Answer:  The FRC East has four Nilfisk Model CD 3707EXP with modifications, NEMA rated motor starter and NEC Class II Group E motor, as characterized in the purchase description.

Q2: Can you inform us as to why you require a waste drum no bigger than 16 gallons? Our units take an industry standard DOT 55-gallon drum, and we provide the standard option of a 23-gallon drum. We can provide a 16-gallon or smaller drum, but would like to know if it is important (i.e., in the government's best interest) to go down this road.

Answer:  The units must be capable of negotiating tight production areas, therefore, the width must be below 30 inches and the drum must be emptied daily for fire protection, aluminum dust.  No more than one pound of aluminum dust may accumulate in the drums.  See NFPA 484.  

Q3. We offer the option of an automatic reverse cleaning system (as opposed to the manual control specified). 
Shall we propose this option, or is it definitely an option the government does not which to explore?

Answer:  The Government does not desire the option of an automatic reverse cleaning system.

Q4. Can you inform us when you require delivery of the 8 units? 

Answer:  Delivery is required within ten (10) weeks of award or sooner.

Q5. Will the government install the central collection system? or will this be the responsibility of the vendor?

Answer:  These will not be permanently installed central units.  These units will be portable support equipment.
