<DESC>The Program Support Center, on behalf of the Department of Health and Human Services, Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with AHIMA Foundation for the subject requirement.
<p>Section 4104(a) of Title IV of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) requires that the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) conduct a study to determine the extent to which and manner in which payment incentives (such as under Medicare or Medicaid) and other funding for purposes of implementing and using certified EHR technology (as defined through HITECH) should be made available to health care providers who are receiving minimal or no payment incentives or other funding under HITECH, Medicare, or Medicaid for such purposes. The purpose of this contract is to conduct this study.</p>
<p>The period of performance is anticipated to be 40 weeks at which time the final report will be submitted.</p>
<p>Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 the AHIMA Foundation s uniquely qualified to complete the work originally required in the ASPE Contract entitled, "EHR Payment Incentives for Providers Ineligible for Payment Incentives and Other Funding" (REMIS No.: RI-11-001) because of their combined and cumulative experiences and expertise in the following areas:</p>
<p>Recognized leadership in and knowledge of the use of health IT and EHRs by many of health care provider types presently not eligible for incentives and other funding under HITECH (including: skilled nursing facilities, nursing facilities, home health agencies, in-patient rehabilitation facilities, long-term care hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, etc.) and clinical workflow in these settings (including the development, management, and guidance on data and information flow in nursing homes, home health, and variety of other settings).<br /><br />Knowledge of the current HITECH programs that have made available incentives and other funding to certain health care providers.<br /><br />Skills in convening, facilitating, and producing written documents concerning meetings of Subject Matter Experts to discuss and synthesize difficult issues related to health IT and identify solutions on the topics of interest to address these problems.<br /><br />Skills in successfully managing interdisciplinary teams of experts required for complex contracts.<br /><br />Expert knowledge in Health IT standards and products that will be considered as part of this scope.<br /><br />Ability to develop policy relevant, written documents related to health IT/EHRs for many of the provider types who presently do not receive incentives/other funding for their acquisition/use of EHRs; and to produce timely documents that address complex issues in a manner that is accessible to senior decision makers.</p>
<p>This acquisition requires expertise in: Health IT/EHRs available to and used by health care providers ineligible for incentives/other funding (such as skilled nursing facilities, nursing facilities, home health agencies, in-patient rehabilitation facilities, long-term care hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, etc.); the clinical workflow in and data needed by these ineligible health care providers, including the need for health information exchange across healthcare providers; in convening and consulting with subject matter experts and managing complex and time sensitive projects; and producing well written, policy relevant, and accessible written deliverables on time.<br /><br />The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether there may be other sources with the necessary expertise and qualifications to perform the work described above including small businesses. Any source capable of performing the work should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Government's requirement as articulated above. No solicitation document is available at this time. Capability statements should be submitted by the response date for this presolicitation notice to the point of contact listed in this notice via email at clint.druk@psc.hhs.gov and include the solicitation nubmer in the subject of the email.</p>

<p><span style="COLOR: black">The DAI Global Model, developed essentially to address General Fund operations, has been deployed at a number of DoD Agencies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Based on these deployments, and capability needs of Agencies deploying in future, there will be a need to mature the DAI Global Model over and beyond the period of this Task Order.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Through this period, new and additional functionality will also need to be incorporated in the Global Model to support Working Capital Fund operations, Grants Management, enhanced Budget Distribution and Management, etc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Such capabilities are currently planned to be in the scope of Release 2.x, and Release 3.x of the DAI Global Model.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="BACKGROUND: yellow; COLOR: black; mso-highlight: yellow">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black">True to its imperatives, the DAI Global Model will continue to be developed, enhanced, and matured from a standpoint of implementing (i) common business processes across implementing Agencies, (ii) the maximum use of standard Oracle Applications functionality for providing needed capabilities, (iii) use of common or congruent Application configurations across implementing Agencies, and (iv) leverage of developed and deployed technical objects to support same/similar business functions, across implementing Agencies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The services provided through this Statement of Work, will support the above mentioned imperatives. </span></p>
<p><span style="BACKGROUND: yellow; COLOR: black; mso-highlight: yellow">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black">The services provided through this Statement of Work, will also support all aspects of enhancement and maintenance towards ensuring that Agency-specific functional and/or technical requirements do NOT alter the Global Model in any fashion, and thereby compromise the effectiveness and integrity of the DAI Global Model.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The need for maintaining the 'baseline' Global Model, through its multiple Release cycles and iterations, stems from the imperative that the integrity and applicability of the DAI Global Model will be preserved at all times through the life of the DAI Program.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The DAI Global Model will serve as the essence of the DAI solution and must be properly developed and maintained to sustain auditability of the implemented solution.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="BACKGROUND: yellow; COLOR: black; mso-highlight: yellow">&nbsp;</span></p>

Contractor responsible for all field measurements and verifications.<br><br>4. CLEANING OF BOILERS FOR OIL AND GREASE REMOVAL<br><br><br>Prior to putting a new boiler into service or returning a boiler to service after it has been repaired and/or contaminated with oil or grease, it must be boiled out to remove these contaminants.  Otherwise, these contaminants can cause operational problems such as foaming and/or priming, reduction of boiler efficiency and in severe cases, even tube failures.  In many cases, alkaline boil out procedures are described in the boiler manufacturer's operating manual for the particular boiler.  However, where they are not, the general procedure described below will suffice.<br><br>Preparation for Cleaning<br>Prior to any cleaning operation, the boiler should be opened and inspected to determine both the actual internal conditions with respect to deposits and to insure that any rags, tools, etc. inadvertently left by workmen have been removed.  Gauge glasses should be replaced with temporary ones and then all bottom drains should be closed and hand hole or manhole covers installed (except where a top one is to be used for adding the cleaning chemicals and filling the unit).  The steam valve from the unit must be closed and the vent(s) opened.<br><br>Cleaning Procedure<br>Once the unit is prepared, the prescribed cleaning chemicals* should be added and the boiler filled with water to the top of the gauge glass.  Where dry chemicals are used, they must be dissolved in a mixing tank prior to transfer into the boiler. It should then be fired on low fire to obtain mixing and circulation. When steam is flowing freely from the vent(s), these are then closed and the pressure is raised to 50% of the operating pressure (except for boilers operated at 15 psi or lower where the pressure may be raised to operating pressure).  The pressure should then be maintained for 12-36 hours and during this period, the boiler should be blown down from the bottom by 1/2 the gauge glass every 2 hours, refilling to the top of the glass after each blow down.<br><br>After the boil out procedure is completed, the boiler should be carefully cooled.  When sufficiently cool, the vent(s) may then be opened and the unit drained and thoroughly flushed with a high pressure hose.  After flushing, it should then be carefully inspected to insure the cleaning has been complete.  Where severe deposits existed initially, it may be necessary to repeat the boil out to obtain proper results.<br><br>After final cleaning and flushing, the temporary gauge glasses should be removed and all hand hole and manhole gaskets be replaced with new ones.  The boiler should then be closed and put in (or returned to) service or placed in wet or dry layup according to proper procedures when the unit is to be stored for any appreciable period of time.<br><br>Chemicals<br>Typically, proprietary chemical blends are specifically recommended for boil out of boilers, such as FORMULA 2985 formulated with a mixture of surfactants, caustic, a phosphate, chelating agents (for mill scale removal), and an embrittlement inhibitor or FORMULA 2990 formulated with a mixture of surfactants, alkali buffer, silicate and phosphate.  These formulated proprietary blends are preferred when time allows. In emergencies, a mixture of 0.5-1.0 lb. trisodium phosphate, 1-2 lb. caustic soda and 0.5-1.0 lb laundry detergent per 100 gals. can give satisfactory results(<br><br>SOLICITATION W912KC-11-T-0020: TERMS and CONDITIONS<br><br>1.0 	INTRODUCTION<br><br>1.1	SCOPE<br><br>	You are invited to submit a bid in response to our Request for Quote RFQ); W912KC-11-T-0020, entitled: Replace Boiler Tubes Building 301 & 302As a result of this solicitation, the Government intends to award a single Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract resulting from this solicitation.  <br><br> 1.2 	NOTICE OF PRE-BID CONFERENCE AND SITE VISIT<br><br>	1.2.1	A pre-bid conference / site visit will be conducted on Thursday, July 28, 2011 9:00 AM-local time at 300 Tanker Road , Coraopolis , PA 15108 for the purpose of briefing on the bid requirements, answering questions regarding this solicitation and conducting a site visit.

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br><br>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br><br>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br><br><br>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
