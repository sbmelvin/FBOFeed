<DESC><p>The Department of Treasury, Bureau of the Public Debt, on behalf of The Department of Treasury's Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB), intends to issue a competitive 8(a) commercial item solicitation approximately March 23, 2009 for a commercial off the shelf (COTS) software package that has been modified and tailored to specifically meet the needs of TTB to automate the permit application process. At present, permit applications are submitted in hard copy. Permits Online is a critical business need and provides applicants and industry members a web-based e-Government solution to submit original and amended permit applications. Permits Online must provide a secure, front-end, Web-based system that provides the necessary information and options to submit a new or amended permit application seamlessly tailored to the applicant's needs, thus improving customer service through improved speed, accuracy, integrity, and consistency in the processing of applications.
<p>The government requires a secure, robust, and scalable system that will facilitate the online submission, routing, and processing of TTB's Original and Amended Applications in order for TTB to authorize applicants to operate alcohol and tobacco related businesses under the FAA Act and Internal Revenue Code. The intended solution shall be consistent with TTB's Enterprise Architecture, provide seamless integration with TTB's other major application systems, and support the receipt and processing of up to 25,000 Original and Amended submissions annually.</p>
<p>TTB anticipates awarding for a total life-cycle of 84 months. An indefinite-delivery indefinite-quantity contract will be awarded. This contract type is being used due to the need for a COTS product that will require modification to a specified set of criteria, and because the number of hours required for maintenance support, health checks and upgrade support in the option periods are unknown.</p>
<p>Award will be made on basis of the best value to the government.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 541512 and the Small Business Size Standard is $25.0 million.</p>
<p>Interested offerors may register at http://www.fedbizopps.gov to receive notification when the solicitation and any amendments are issued and available for downloading. Please note that the General Services Administration provides the notification service as a convenience and does not guarantee that all persons on the mailing list will receive notifications. Therefore, we recommend that you monitor the FedBizOpps site for all information relevant to desired acquisitions.</p>

This requirement is a total small business set-aside under NAISC: 541940 and Product service Code: R416-Veterinary Services.
Overview:The US Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 7, Alaska, is preparing to issue solicitation for veterinarian related professional services to be physically conducted within the Canadian Province of Northwest Territories along the Beaufort Sea Coast (community of Inuvik).

The solicitation package will outline the specific period of performance dates of this requirement, and the anticipated award will be inclusive of a Base Period of approximately 30 days, with two additional Optional Periods for extension of approximately 30 days each calendar year.

<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">The International Boundary &amp; Water Commission, United States Section (USIBWC), requires the services in accordance with the scope of work (SOW) entitled Geotechnical Analysis and Engineering Evaluation of the Lower Rio Grande Flood Control Project Levee System Within the Lateral A to Donna Pump to Retamal Dam Levee Reach, Hidalgo County.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">The United States Section of the International Boundary and Water Commission (USIBWC) has recently conducted hydraulic, aerial, geophysical, and exploratory geotechnical studies of the Lower Rio Grande Flood Control Project (LRGFCP) to assess the ability of the associated levees to safely contain flood flows in the Rio Grande.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>From these studies, the USIBWC has determined that certain reaches of the levees require rehabilitation improvements in order to meet FEMA requirements for the safe containment of 100-year flood flows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">The LRGFCP extends from the town of Pe&ntilde;itas, Texas at its upstream end, to 28 miles above the Gulf of Mexico, a distance of about 158 river miles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The LRGFCP has two diversion dams, Anzalduas Dam and Retamal Dam, approximately 17 and 57 river miles below Pe&ntilde;itas, which divert portions of the flood flows into the Main Floodway and the Mexico Floodway, respectively.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The LRGFCP was constructed to provide flood protection to urban, suburban, and irrigated lands in the Rio Grande delta in both the United States and Mexico.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">For planning purposes, the LRGFCP has been divided into several reaches.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The work under this Scope of Work is for Lateral A to Donna Pump to Retamal Dam Levee reach within Hidalgo County.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Lateral A to Donna Pump to Retamal Dam levee reach is approximately 14 miles in length from Carlson Settling Basin to the Retamal Diversion Dam.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This levee reach begins 5500 feet west of South Jackson Road near the McAllen-Pharr City limits to US 281 south of Donna near the Las Palomas State Wildlife Park. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">Due to FEMA certification requirements, the USIBWC now requires that a full geotechnical evaluation of this levee reach be conducted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The geotechnical investigations shall evaluate foundation stability for the added loading, slope stability, as well as potential for seepage or piping through and/or below the levee in critical and questionable areas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The USIBWC requires that a determination be made if additional work is needed based on the evaluation results in order to assure the levee is structurally sound and meet the FEMA levee certification criteria.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The USIBWC goal is to ensure that this levee reach will provide adequate safety and protection against a 100 year flood event and the loadings that an event of that magnitude would impose on the existing levee, to include any levee raising that is needed to meet the 3 foot required freeboard.</span></p>

<DESC>Title:  MAG-PLAN Gulf of Mexico Economic Impact Model Upgrade Study
Notice of Pre-Solicitation Conference-------------------------
The U. S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS) intends to competitively award a contract to upgrade an economic model developed for in-house MMS use:  MAG-PLAN Gulf of Mexico Economic Impact Model.  The anticipated period of performance will be 18-24 months from the effective date of the contract.  The applicable NAICS Code is 541690:  Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services.
The MMS is responsible for managing Federal offshore energy resources.  The MMS uses MAG-PLAN to estimate the economic impacts of natural gas and oil extraction activities on the Federal Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) in the Gulf of Mexico.  
PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  MMS has developed MAG-PLAN, a Microsoft Access-based 2-stage input-output model using IMPLAN multipliers, to estimate employment, personal income, and similar economic impacts from OCS activities.  MMS develops Exploration & Development (E&D) Scenarios containing estimates of the level of exploration, development, and production anticipated from a proposed OCS lease sale or set of lease sales, and these scenarios are the essential input for MAG-PLAN.
The objective of the MAG-PLAN Modification study is to strengthen and refine the Bureaus procedures for estimating the onshore economic effects from OCS-related activities by improving the current MAG-PLAN model.  MMS seeks professionals with expertise in applied regional economic impact analysis and oil and gas engineering and/or project cost modeling and analysis, to (1) update and refine existing industry expenditure data; (2) refine the methodology used to distribute industry expenditures to onshore locations and sectors; (3) incorporate recent advances and changes to industry practices, especially FPSOs and subsea tiebacks; (4) refine and test MAG-PLAN software to resolve issues and increase user-functionality; and (5) improve the model documentation.  
A pre-solicitation conference for this contract will be held on March 26, 2009, in Herndon, VA, from 10:00 a.m. to11:30 a.m. EDT.  Upon arriving at the site, attendees will be able to sign up for 15-minute one-on-one sessions with MMS staff to discuss the effort, from 3:45 p.m. until 6:00 p.m.  Pre-solicitation conferences for two other efforts to upgrade MMS economic models will be held later on the same day (see below).

<DESC>Title:  MAG-PLAN Alaska Economic Impact Model Upgrade Study
Notice of Pre-solicitation Conference------------------------The U. S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS), intends to competitively award a contract to upgrade a regional economic impact model developed for in-house MMS use:  MAG-PLAN Alaska.  The anticipated period of performance will be 18 months from the effective date of the contract.  The applicable NAICS Code is 541690:  Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services.
The MMS is responsible for managing Federal offshore energy resources.  The MMS uses MAG-PLAN to estimate the economic impacts of natural gas and oil exploration, development, and production activities on the Federal Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) off Alaska.  
PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  The MMS has developed MAG-PLAN, a Microsoft Access-based, 2-stage input-output model using IMPLAN multipliers, to estimate employment, personal income, and similar regional economic impacts from OCS activities.  MMS-developed Exploration & Development (E&D) Scenarios containing estimates of the level of exploration, development, and production anticipated from a proposed OCS lease sale or set of lease sales comprise the inputs for MAG-PLAN.
The objective of the MAG-PLAN Alaska Upgrade Study is to strengthen and refine the Bureaus procedures for estimating the onshore economic effects from OCS-related activities by improving the current version of MAG-PLAN.  MMS seeks professionals with expertise in applied regional economic impact analysis and oil and gas engineering and/or project cost modeling and analysis, to (1) update and refine existing industry expenditure data; (2) refine the methodology used to distribute industry expenditures to onshore locations and sectors; (3) incorporate recent advances and changes to industry practices; (4) refine and test MAG-PLAN software to resolve issues and increase user-functionality; and (5) improve the model documentation.  
A pre-solicitation conference for this contract will be held on Thursday, March 26, 2009, in Herndon, VA, from 12:30-2:00 p.m. EDT.  Upon arriving at the site, attendees will be able to sign up for 15-minute one-on-one sessions to discuss the effort.  MMS employees will be available for these sessions from 3:45 until 6:00 p.m.  Pre-solicitation conferences for two other efforts to upgrade MMS economic models will be held later on the same day (M09PS00038 OECM and MktSim, and M09PS00036 MAG-PLAN Gulf of Mexico Region).  
PRE-SOLICITATION CONFERENCE  MMS anticipates issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the model upgrade.  In anticipation of releasing the RFP, MMS has scheduled a pre-solicitation conference to discuss the project and the anticipated work.   The conference is scheduled for 12:30-2:00 ET, March 26, 2009, at the MMS offices in Herndon, VA.  The meeting is expected to take 90 minutes and will be followed by optional one-on-one sessions with MMS personnel to discuss the draft RFP and/or other issues related to the contract.  To the extent feasible, MMS will attempt to accommodate the schedules of non-local parties attending the conference in person.  Should your company be interested in attending the pre-solicitation conference, please contact MMS as instructed below.  If you expect to schedule a one-on-one session, please indicate that as well.  Pre-scheduled one-on-one meetings take precedence over those that are scheduled during the pre-solicitation conference.  If you are interested in attending the pre-solicitation conference, please e-mail Caroline Laikin at caroline.laikin@mms.gov indicating your interest in attending the conference and one-on-one meetings MMS will post advance materials at http://www.mms.gov/ld/2009PreSolicitationConferences/2009_Info_Alaska.htm (currently inactive).  MMS anticipates activating this website by March 9, 2009, and posting all materials (other than presentations), by Close of Business one week from the date of this announcement.
There are two options for participating from remote locations.  Companies or individuals wishing to participate via WebEx and audio link at the MMS office in Anchorage, AK, should inform Jerry Brian at jerry.brian@mms.gov no later than March 18, 2009.

The NIST Materials Science and Engineering Laboratory  requires a Stereomicroscope and Eppendorf Micromanipulator to provide a platform for locating and moving broken test structures from stress and strength measurement for subsequent fractography.

The required instrument has several unique capabilities that are essential to the success of the project:
1.	Integrated coarse and fine manipulation with proportional control via central joystick.  The work range (20 mm) and resolution (40 nm) provide a large range of motion (to locate and move fragments) with exceptional control (to pick up fragments).
2.	Oil-based and air-based pipette system provides a wide range of pressures for both micromanipulation (vacuum) and microinjection (dispensing of aqueous solutions).  The pipettes range in size from 4 um to 15 um, with both flat ends wand tapered ends, allowing the user to manipulate samples of all shapes and sizes.
3.	Ability to retain field of view and parfocal correction during manipulation via unique rotating objective turret that changes the body from the stereo light path (1x achromat stereo lens) to the macro light path (3.5x macro lens). 

Carl Zeiss Microimaging, Inc. is the only contractor who can provide a Stereomicroscope and Eppendorf Micromanipulator that meets NIST’s requirements.  Therefore, Carl Zeiss Microimaging, Inc. is uniquely qualified to provide the required Stereomicroscope and Eppendorf Micromanipulator.

Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractor’s commercial schedule.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 333314, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  The Government will consider responses received by 3:00 p.m. (EST) on March 21, 2009.  Inquiries will only be accepted via email to paula.wilkison@nist.gov.  No telephone requests will be honored.   

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.

An AN/LAE-47 CH-53 Dual Dispenser Pod Shipset consists of a left pod, a right pod, left attaching hardware, right attaching hardware, four D-67/ALE-47 Dispenser Housings, four MX12023/ALE-47 Countermeasure Magazines, and two SA-2669/ALE-47(V) Sequencers.  
The AN/ALE-47 Dual Dispenser Pods were developed in a previous sole source prototype effort as a proof of concept to meet the new DoN requirement baseline quantity of 120 countermeasure expendables with forward firing capability.  The Dual Dispenser Pod increases the number of expendables from 60 to 120 and also directs the countermeasures forward/downward in order to provide a more effective dispense pattern.  This procurement is a 'follow-on' buy of the prototype design and includes final validation and support as well as delivery of the engineering drawings developed during the prototype phase.  DoN intent is to satisfy an immediate operational requirement with Military qualified production hardware required for installations to begin eight months after contract award.

Note 22 applies, this synopsis is for informational purposes only as the Government intends to award this effort on a sole source basis.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center. Carderock Division (NSWCCD) intends to conduct a non-competitive procurement with Aircraft Appliances and Equipment (AAE), Ontario Canada for the purchase of one (1) AAE/CINC Model 741387 Combined Oil Water Separator (OWS) unit in support of the Naval Sea Systems Command's (NAVSEA) OPA Technology Identification and Assessment Program (TTAP). A firm-fixed price award is anticipated following procurement procedures of FAR 13.5 - Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.The NSWCCD Code 633, Wastewater Management Branch manages the Naval Sea Systems Command's (NAVSEA) OPA Technology Identification and Assessment Program (TTAP). The OPA TIAP is used to identify, assess, and verify the performance of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) oily water separators (OWS) for possible use by the Navy. The identification phase of TIAP consists of a survey of manufactures and distributors of COTS OWS systems. The assessment phase defines how the systems operate and notes any potential ship impacts. The AAE/CINC Combined system has successfully progressed through the identification and assessment phases and is now at the final verification phase. A key part of TIAP verification phase is the test and evaluation (T&E) of OWSs in order to verify performance and application to existing or new ship designs. T&E is a critical step in developing the performance data needed by the NAVSEA Central Technical Authority (CTA) to assess various competing technologies. AAE ! has developed an oil pollution abatement (OPA) device that utilizes drum type centrifugal separation and ultra filtration (UF) to treat bilge water. This process is unique because the system uses a specific drum type centrifugal separator and ceramic membrane UF polishing unit. Based on the initial TIAP analysis, the system was recommended continued evaluation and progression to the verification phase. Additionally, the DDG-l000 program office has specified the AAE/C1NC Combined system for installation on DDG-l000). Based on the results of the OPA TIAP analysis and the DDG-l000 Program Offices decision to specify the unit for installation, NAVSEA and the Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP), a joint DoD funding organization, has funded NSWCCD to test and evaluate the AAE/C1NC Combined OWS system.The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authorit! y of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Reference RFQ number N00167-09-T-0077 with any correspondence.

This program supports the Director, Acquisition Career Management's (DACM) effort to foster cooperation and information sharing by providing opportunities to understand and experience first-hand the issues and challenges facing leaders across the acquisition workforce (AWF) and the broader Navy arena.  This program course of instruction is designed for those who are, or have the capability of leading high performing organizations and programs today, and have the potential and motivation to take on even more responsible senior leadership positions across the AWF within the ne! xt few years.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.

<p>1. CONTRACT INFORMATION: This announcement is 100% set-aside for Small Businesses only. The Savannah District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers requires the services of Architect-Engineer (A-E) firms for a maximum of two, Indefinite Delivery Contracts (IDC) for Construction Management Services. These contracts are being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act, as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6. See numbered note 24 for general information on the A-E selection process. Firms will be selected for negotiations based on demonstrated competence for the required work. Offerors are cautioned to read this announcement in its entirety. The contracts awarded as a result of this announcement will be administered by the Savannah District for use on federal projects under its jurisdiction and, if requested, for other Corps of Engineers District s within the SERO of IMA. Contracts may be issued up to one year after selection approval. Typically, the contracts will consist of three ordering schedules, each schedule not to exceed one year, for a total of up to three years maximum. The total amount of each contract over the three year ordering period may not exceed $4,500,000. Task Orders will be primarily for Construction Management Services. These task orders are firm fixed price. Projects to be assigned are not yet determined and funds are not presently available. Assignment of individual task orders to the contracts with identical scopes of work will be based on the following factors: (1) Performance and quality of deliverables under the current IDC, (2) Current capacity of the firm to accomplish the task order in the required time, and (3) Equitable distribution of work among identical contracts. The NAICS is 541310; size standard $4.5 million. The firm must be capable of responding to and working on multiple task orders concurrently. Notice Organizational Conflict of Interest. The work to be performed may create an actual or potential organizational conflict of interest on future acquisitions. Offerors should refer to FAR subpart 9.5 - ORGANIZATIONATIONAL AND CONSULTANT CONLICTS OF INTEREST. An organizational conflict of interest can arise when a contractor possesses an economic incentive that renders it unable, or potentially unable, to provide impartial assistance or advice; or an unfair competitive advantage in obtaining a contract as the result of access to nonpublic information about a competitor or procurement. When an organizational conflict of interest arises it can have serious implications for the contractor that can range from disclosure obligations to disqualification from an award. Accordingly, some restrictions on the future activities of the contractor and its subcontractors may be required. And, these restrictions may include prohibiting the contractor or its subcontractors from participating in a contract or a task order. A contractor which participates in preparing design drawings or documents for future construction contracts may be prohibited from providing CMS for that contract. However, in future procurements, the contractor or its subcontractors may request a determination of its ability to participate in a particular procurement from the Contracting Officer. Proposals submitted for procurements or services for which the contractor or its subcontractor is later determined to have an organizational conflict of interest shall be submitted at the risk of the contractor or its subcontractors.</p>
<p>To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in the DOD Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Register via the CCR Internet site at http://www.ccr.gov or by contacting the DOD Electronic Commerce Information Center at 1-800-334-3414.</p>

It is anticipated that the Army will collapse the 19 AD forests into to 2 AD forests.  Currently, the Army AD forests uses several different types of AD and exchange management tools.  In addition to obtaining one standard enterprise solution, the Army is also seeking to gain efficiencies by establishing a repository for unused licenses that can be shared throughout the forests. <BR><BR>ACQUISITION OBJECTIVES: The Army is seeking to provide a standard Enterprise AD and Exchange tools set to a nomadic, geographically-dispersed user base and across a unique collection of computing environments, networks, and security postures.

A enterprise tool allow identified installation personnel to mailbox-enable users within their OU, yet mailboxes need to be distributed evenly between the mail stores of each RIA tier. Non-Enterprise administrators are not to be able to circumvent the designed solution through the use of other tools. <BR>      <BR>As such, the primary objectives of this  acquisition are to: <BR><BR>1. Minimize up-front tools investments (i.e., pay by license)<BR>2. Support near-term, high priority activities such as collapsing AD forests <BR>3.

The automated phase of the provisioning of Exchange mailboxes at the Area Processing Center is to be based on the following guidance:<BR><BR>A. RIA Tier 1 users- GO/SES, 06, CSM, and HQDA/MACOM/Corps/Divisions Principal Staff. Of the current mailbox database stores dedicated for these RIA tier 1 users, the mailbox provisioning tool is to check the number of RIA tier 1 users per each of these stores before provisioning a mailbox and presenting the mailbox database store with the lowest amount of RIA tier 1 users to the System Administrator as the proposed mailbox database store for the new RIA tier 1 user to be provisioned from. This solution will provide a rotation-based load balancing model.<BR><BR>B. RIA Tier 2 users- Target Community: 05/06, GS14/15, Bn/Bde Principal Staff, select staff action offices. Of the current mailbox database stores dedicated for these RIA tier 2 users, the mailbox provisioning tool is to check the number of RIA tier 2 users per each of these stores before provisioning a mailbox and presenting the mailbox database store with the lowest amount of RIA tier 2 users to the System Administrator as the proposed mailbox database store for the new RIA tier 2 user to be provisioned from. This solution will provide a rotation-based load balancing model.<BR><BR>C. RIA Tier 3 users- Target Community: The average Army community. Of the current mailbox database stores dedicated for these RIA tier 3 users, the mailbox provisioning tool is to check the number of RIA tier 3 users per each of these stores before provisioning a mailbox and presenting the mailbox database store with the lowest amount of RIA tier 3 users to the System Administrator as the proposed mailbox database store for the new RIA tier 3 user to be provisioned from. This solution will provide a rotation-based load balancing model.<BR><BR>D. RIA Tier 4 users- users who do not require a computer to do their job. Of the current mailbox database stores dedicated for these RIA tier 4 users, the mailbox provisioning tool is to check the number of RIA tier 4 users per each of these stores before provisioning a mailbox and presenting the mailbox database store with the lowest amount of RIA tier 4 users to the System Administrator as the proposed mailbox database store for the new RIA tier 4 user to be provisioned from. This solution will provide a rotation-based load balancing model.<BR><BR>ARCHITECTURAL DEVELOPMENT: The successful offeror will play a significant role in presenting the most efficient Directory Services enterprise tools to the designated Army users. The Government will only consider enterprise tools that are compatible with future and existing AD and Exchange Army system designs in both software and underlying hardware platforms to provide a continuous high quality service to designated Army users. A successful vendor must be able to provide enterprise licenses as soon as possible after contract award.<BR><BR>SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT: The AKO Enterprise Services contractor will have significant responsibility for the continued development of the AD and Exchange Directory Service tools functionality. The Government seeks help in identifying user needs, back-end business application needs, and overall functional enhancements. The Government also seeks the establishment of strong processes to formalize the development and facilitate the prioritization of AD and Exchange improvements using enterprise tool. <BR><BR>PERFORMANCE-BASED: Proposals will be solicited using performance-based service contracting principles including use of a Statement of Objectives approach for defining the requirements. <BR><BR>QUESTIONS: The Government is interested in obtaining the following information from industry to consider in determining its acquisition strategy and development of the RFP. <BR>1. Common enterprise services (collaboration, e-mail, global user directory, voice, and video/web conferencing).<BR>2. Data center services (application, data, and web hosting; on-site technical support; Tier 1 thru Tier 4 help desk).<BR>3. Security services (remote user access; cross-domain or multi-level security; user/device authentication and access control)<BR>4. Server virtualization management.<BR>5. Back office services (asset management, network operations, capacity planning, and change management)<BR>6. Application, data, and user migration strategies.<BR><BR>SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS: Responses to this RFI will be in the form of a White Paper, not to exceed fifteen (15) pages, and supported by a Microsoft Power Point briefing, including notes, not to exceed ten (10) slides. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this RFI or any follow-up information requests.

The BOR requirement is for the assessment of impacts of spawning gravel additions on geomorphology and spawning habitat in Clear Creek.  Sole source justification has been prepared in support of this acquisition.
Firms believing they can provide this service above must provide written notification to the Contracting Officer via email to bmahoney@mp.usbr.gov with supporting evidence to that effect in sufficient detail to demonstrate the respondent's ability to meet the stated requirements. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. All responses received within 5 calendar days of the date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Responses should be emailed to the Government point of contact for this acquisition.  Responses should include the firm's Dun and Bradstreet number (DUNS) and Tax Identification Number (TIN). Firms should identify business size (i.e. small business, other than small business, etc.) in accordance with the size standard for NAICS Code 541690 which is $18 Million. This notice may represent the only official notice of such a solicitation.  
The requirement consists of the following items:   Task 1 - Project Management - The contractor shall a) send one or two representatives, as requested and needed, to monthly Clear Creek Team meetings to serve as technical experts in geomorphic matters related to project design and monitoring.  Meetings usually held in either Anderson or Redding, California.  b) prepare monthly progress reports describing status of each task contained in this contract.    c) meet with the contracting officer's technical representative up to 6 times per year to discuss status and progress of work.  Task 2 - Aerial Photographs - The contractor shall conduct an aerial flight of Clear Creek from Whiskeytown Dam to the Sacramento River confluence.  The portion from the Sacramento River to Clear Creek Road Bridge will be ortho-photos, while the reach from Clear Creek Road Bridge to Whiskeytown Dam will not be ortho-photos but will be rubbersheeted to fit the LiDAR and existing topography.  Exact specifications shall be determined by Reclamation and the contractor after review of potential costs.  Photographs shall include the entire project footprint for the Channel Restoration Project including Phases 1, 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, 3c, Reading Bar, and all borrow areas.  Task 3 - Conduct a Longitudinal Profile - The contractor shall conduct a longitudinal profile from Whiskeytown Dam to the confluence with the Sacramento River.  Data collected shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, streambed elevation, water surface elevation.  Profile shall be constructed with shots taken approximately every 30 feet between the dam and the confluence.  Profile shall also include locations of all past, active, and known future spawning gravel injection sites.  Task 4 - Monitor Topography Below Injection Sites - Contractor shall conduct two (2) in-stream topographic surveys at, and downstream, of each of the following gravel injection locations: Whiskeytown Dam, Below Dog Gulch, Above Peltier Valley Bridge, Paige Bar, Above NEED Camp, Below NEED Camp, Placer Road Bridge, Clear Creek Road Bridge, Reading Bar, Below Saeltzer Dam (City of Redding), Phase 3A and Phase 2A.  Surveys shall be conducted during the summer, following the rainy season, only if flows of sufficient magnitude occurred to move gravel at injection locations. Topographic surveys shall document downstream movement of spawning gravel.  Surveys should extend downstream to capture gravel's leading edge.  For in-stream and lateral berm injection sites contractor shall survey, if feasible, topography of the gravel injection prior to its movement by high flows.  Task 5 - Map Redd Location Versus Potential Spawning Habitat - Obtain GIS database(s) of Chinook salmon and steelhead redd locations and potential spawning habitat maps/data from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Red Bluff.  Using a GIS database and the aerial images produced in task 2, produce three sets of maps showing redd locations, potential spawning habitat, and maps combining redd locations and potential spawning habitat for the reach between Whiskeytown Dam and the confluence with the Sacramento River.  Task 6 - Potential Spawning Habitat Change Over Time - Assess and quantify, to the greatest extent possible, changes in the amount of potential spawning habitat located between Whiskeytown Dam and the confluence with the Sacramento River.  Analysis will use all available historic information, including reports/memos from 1954, 1970, 2001 and the 2009 dataset produced in task 5.  Task 7 - Gravel Transport Calculations and Analysis - Calculate sediment transport rates at the bottom of reach 1 (near NEED Camp) and reach 2 (near Clear Creek Road Bridge).  Data collected shall be used to refine gravel augmentation strategy as presented in the 2006 Update to the Clear Creek Gravel Management Plan.  Contractor shall secure access to sampling sites such that data can be collected at their own discretion, volition and frequency.  Task 8 - Compare Talus, Lateral Berm, Channel Relocation Restoration, and Instream Methods of Spawning Gravel Injection Methods.  Review available information relating to Central Valley Projects, focusing on Clear Creek if possible, regarding:  spawning gravel injection projects, spawning gravel movement, potential habitat created, and use of potential spawning habitat by spawning anadromous fish.  Where data is available, compare the types of spawning gravel injection methods to determine the following: 1) rate of gravel entrainment, 2) amount of potential spawning habitat created by projects, 3) cost per ton of gravel placed, 4) cost per unit (e.g., square foot) of potential spawning habitat created.  Analysis should focus on determining cost/benefit relationship between various injection methods and locations.

<DESC>Notice of Pre-solicitation Conference------------------
The U. S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS) intends to competitively award one contract to upgrade two economic models developed for in-house MMS use:  the Offshore Environmental Cost Model (OECM) and the Market Simulation Model (MktSim). The anticipated period of performance will be 18 months from the effective date of the contract.  The applicable NAICS Code is 541690, and the work is multi-disciplinary. 
The MMS is responsible for managing Federal offshore energy resources.  The MMS uses the OECM to estimate the environmental and social costs of natural gas and oil extraction activities on the Federal Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) and MktSim to determine the substitution effects of energy alternatives to OCS oil and natural gas production, as well as to estimate the consumer surplus value of OCS oil and gas extraction activities.    
PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  The Department of the Interior is required to keep in place at all times a 5-year schedule (5-year program) of proposed OCS oil and gas lease auctions specifying, as accurately as possible, the size, timing, and location of each lease sale.  As part of the 2-3 year iterative process of public comment, analysis, and decision, MMS conducts a cost-benefit (net benefits) analysis of each proposed 5-year schedule for the Secretarys consideration.  A part of this analysis is estimation of Net Environmental and Social Costs (ESC) imposed on society by the exploration, development, production, and transportation activities necessary to get to market those oil and gas resources anticipated to be discovered and produced under each proposal.  Using MMS-developed exploration & development scenarios and production profiles, MktSim estimates the volume of each other energy source (increased imports, coal, alternative energy, reduced consumption etc.) the economy would require in the absence of the new lease sales in the 5-year proposal (essentially, the No Action Alternative in the programmatic Environmental Impact Statement).  The OECM estimates the ESC anticipated from OCS oil and gas activities resulting from the 5-year proposal as well as the ESC of the energy alternatives/substitutions likely to result from not approving a new 5-year program.  Subtracting the latter from the former produces the Net Environmental and Social Costs.  MktSim also estimates the consumer surplus benefits of the activities anticipated under the 5-year proposal.  The purpose of the contract would be to completely revise both models and all associated data.

A pre-solicitation conference regarding this effort will be held on Thursday, March 26, 2009, in Herndon, VA, from 2:15-3:45 p.m. ET. .  Upon arriving at the site, attendees will be able to sign up for 15-minute one-on-one sessions with MMS personnel to discuss the effort.  These sessions will begin at 3:45 p.m. and end no later than 6:00 p.m. ET.  Pre-solicitation conferences for two other efforts to update MMS economic models will be held earlier on the same day (see below).
PRE-SOLICITATION CONFERENCE MMS anticipates issuing one Request for Proposal (RFP) for the upgrade of both the OECM and MktSim.  In anticipation of releasing the RFP, MMS has scheduled a pre-solicitation conference to discuss the project and the anticipated work.  The conference is scheduled to take place on Thursday, March 26, 2009, from 2:15 to 3:45 p.m. ET, in Herndon, VA.  The meeting is expected to take 90 minutes and will be followed by optional one-on-one sessions with MMS personnel to discuss the draft RFP and/or other issues related to the project.  Should your company be interested in attending the pre-solicitation conference, please contact MMS as instructed below.  If you expect to schedule a one-on-one session, please indicate that as well.  Pre-scheduled one-on-one meetings take precedence over those that are scheduled during the pre-solicitation conference.  If you are interested in attending the pre-solicitation conference, please e-mail Debra Bridge at debra.bridge@mms.gov indicating your interest in attending the conference and one-on-one meetings.  MMS will post advance materials at  http://www.mms.gov/ld/2009PreSolicitationConferences/2009_Model_Market_contract.htm (currently inactive).  MMS anticipates activating this website by March 9, 2009, and posting all materials (other than presentations)  by Close of Business one week from the date of this announcement.  
There are two options for participating from remote locations.  Companies or individuals wishing to participate via WebEx and audio link at the MMS office in Anchorage, AK, should inform Jerry Brian via email at jerry.brian@mms.gov no later than March 18, 2009.  Those wishing to call into the conference from their locations must inform Debra Bridge (via email at debra.bridge@mms.gov), Contracting Officer, no later than Monday, March 23, 2009.  
Individuals or companies attending this conference may also wish to attend one or both of two other pre-solicitation conferences to be held at 10:00 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. ET, the same day, March 26, 2009. The purpose of the other two conferences will be to discuss anticipated contracts to update internal MMS models known as MAG-PLAN Gulf of Mexico (Pre-Solicitation M09PS00036); and MAG-PLAN Alaska (Pre-Solicitation No. M09PS00037).  See separate announcements for these conferences.  
RESPONSE DATE AND SUBMISSION:  Please indicate your interest in attending the pre-solicitation conference and, if applicable, your interest in scheduling a one-on-one session with MMS staff to:  Minerals Management Service, 381 Elden Street, MS-2101, Herndon, VA  20170-4817, Attn: Debra Bridge, no later than Monday, March 23, 2009.  Any questions regarding this procurement should be emailed to debra.bridge@mms.gov.  Please include with your question(s) your full name, Solicitation No. M09PS00038, & Title OECM/MktSim Upgrade, your organization name, complete address, point of contact, and phone and fax numbers.  TELEPHONIC QUESTIONS OR REQUESTS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.

<RESPDATE>032309
<CONTACT>Lloyd S. Blackwell, Small Business Specialist, Phone 202-366-9564, Email lloyd.blackwell@nhtsa.dot.gov
<DESC>I.  Background 

Research and data show that Latinos in the United States are at particular risk of death and injury from alcohol-impaired driving crashes.  In 2006, 42,708 people were killed in motor vehicle traffic crashes.  Of those fatalities, 32 percent occurred in alcohol-impaired-driving crashes.  During that same year, 5,405 Latinos were fatally injured in motor vehicle traffic crashes in the U.S.  Of these fatalities, 36 percent were in alcohol-impaired driving crashes.  Motor vehicle traffic crashes are the leading cause of death for Latinos ages 1-44 (as compared with ages 4-34 for the general population).  Although the number of fatalities among Latinos in the U.S. in alcohol impaired driving crashes have decreased somewhat, impaired driving crashes, death and injury in Latino communities remain a serious problem.

According to the U.S. Census, the Hispanic population has grown almost 60 percent since the 1990 census and is predicted to reach 59 million by 2030, making Hispanics the single largest minority group in the U.S.  The Hispanic population is growing much faster than the U.S. population as a whole.  A higher proportion of Hispanics are killed in alcohol-impaired driving crashes than other racial and ethnic groups.   

In efforts to address alcohol-impaired driving in the general population in the U.S., NHTSA has focused on a variety of effective countermeasures including enforcement, support to the criminal justice system (prosecution and adjudication), screening and brief intervention and the use of emerging technologies, such as ignition interlocks.  Specifically, NHTSA is focusing its efforts on high visibility enforcement programs, Traffic Safety Resource Prosecutors, DWI/Drug Courts, establishing screening and brief intervention as a routine medical practice to identify individuals with alcohol misuse problems, and ignition interlocks for impaired driving offenders.  

In the area of high visibility enforcement, NHTSA continues to support the National Impaired Driving Law Enforcement Crackdown, “Drunk Driving. Over the Limit, Under Arrest,” as well as sustained enforcement throughout the year.  NHTSA media campaign “Drunk Driving, “Over the Limit., Under Arrest” seeks to reduce impaired driving, especially among 21-34 year old males, who are at high risk in alcohol-impaired driving crashes, by increasing the level of high visibility enforcement during high risk times of the year, and publicizing the enforcement campaign using paid and earned media.  Enforcement-oriented messages are used to support the campaign in both English and Spanish.  

NHTSA has worked in conjunction with a number of organizations at the Federal, State and local levels to develop and demonstrate program strategies and activities specifically designed to reduce alcohol-impaired driving crashes and related fatalities and injuries in Latino populations.  

With NHTSA support, in 2004, the Latino Council on Alcohol and Tobacco Prevention (LCAT) developed and demonstrated the use of program strategies to reduce alcohol-related fatalities and injuries in three communities with sizable Latino populations:  Albuquerque, NM; Durham, NC; and San Antonio, TX.  These communities focused especially on law enforcement Crackdown events and public education to members of their communities.  

In 2005, the Arizona Governor’s Office of Highway Safety and El Pueblo, NC were selected to demonstrate sustained enforcement efforts, combined with targeted paid and earned media, in communities with large Latino populations, in an effort to reduce impaired driving fatalities and injuries.     

In 2007, NHTSA worked with LCAT to host a one-day summit in Washington, D.C., to discuss the latest research and data concerning strategies to reduce impaired driving in the Latino populations.  Participants at the summit included a broad cross-section of representatives of National, State and local organizations; Federal and State government agencies; and academia.  NHTSA is publishing a report documenting the key recommendations from this meeting. The report will include data on the extent of the problem, summary of research, descriptions of successful programs and links to resources outside NHTSA.  
NHTSA is also developing a report on the “State of Knowledge” regarding Alcohol-Impaired Driving Among Diverse Populations.  
We know that some programs and strategies addressing alcohol-impaired driving in Hispanic communities have been developed and implemented through other agencies at the Federal, State and local levels.  One example is the California Highway Patrol’s “El Protector” Program.  The program is directed at the Hispanic community with the goal of reducing disproportionate number of Hispanic surnamed drivers and victims involved in traffic related collisions and places special emphasis on educating through dialogue with the community, instead of focusing on enforcement measures.

<SUBJECT>Human Odor as a Biometric for Deception
<SOLNBR>Labs09-01
<RESPDATE>031109
<ARCHDATE>09302009
<CONTACT>Michele Midgett, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-254-6836, Email michele.midgett@dhs.gov
<DESC>SYNOPSIS: 

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Science and Technology (S&T) Directorate is seeking sources for a potential requirement to expand its set of biometric screening tools for deceptive individuals by investigating the possibility of using the human odor signature as an indicator for deception.


1.0 BACKGROUND 

The DHS S&T Directorate is tasked with researching and organizing the scientific, engineering, and technological resources of the United States and leveraging these existing resources into technological tools to help protect the homeland.  An important aspect of homeland protection is identification, at airports and ports of entry, of individuals who may have intent to inflict harm on the United States.  Various biometric data can be used to conduct initial screenings, so that individuals whose biometric signatures indicate that they might be engaging in deception can be examined further.  DHS S&T seeks to investigate whether or not the addition of human odor to biometric signature data would provide additional evidence of deception, thus improving the ability to identify individuals who may intend harm to the nation. 


2.0 STATEMENT OF NEED

The DHS S&T Directorate is requesting approval for a contracted, outsourced, proof-of-principle study to determine if human odor signatures can serve as an indicator of deception.  In a separate task, DHS S&T already is conducting experiments in deceptive behavior and collecting human odor samples; these activities will not be part of this proof-of-principle study.  This research will consist primarily of the analysis and study of the human odor samples collected to determine if a deception indicator can be found.  As a secondary goal, this study will examine the human odor samples for evidence to support the theory that an individual can be identified by that individual’s odor signature.  
This research has the potential for enhancing our ability to detect individuals with harmful intent.   A positive result from this proof-of-principle study would provide evidence that human odor is a useful indicator for certain human behaviors and, in addition, that it may be used as a biometric identifier.   	 

Contractor Requirements/Technical Specifications:
•	Must be able to collaborate and coordinate with the experimental team that will collect the human odor samples 
•	Must be able to receive and use the odor samples collected by the experimental team to perform this proof-of-principle study 
•	Must be knowledgeable in the human odor spectrum and its chemical components 
•	Must have demonstrated experience in working with volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) in a laboratory environment 
•	Must have demonstrated experience with a gas chromatograph (GC) and mass spectrometer (MS), particularly in the identification and analysis of VOCs

<a href="mailto:tina.m.krawczyk@usace.army.mil">US Army Engineer District, New England</a>
<DESC><BR>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is issuing a Sources Sought Announcement for an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Architect-Engineer contract for Bridge Inspection and Incidental Remedial Design to determine the interest, availability, and capability of HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned and Small Business concerns.  The NAICS code for the work described below is 541330 with a size standard of $4,500,000.  Work will begin in May 2009 and extend over a 3 year period.  The total work effort is estimated at $3,000,000.  The location of services to be performed under this contract shall be primarily the six New England States (ME, NH, VT, MA, CT, and RI) but will also include all other states and districts currently covered by the U.S, Army Corps North Atlantic Divisions (NADs) mission areas (NY, PA, NJ, DE, MD, VA, WV and the District of Columbia).  <BR><BR>This work involves bridge inspection and remedial design.  The contractor will be required to perform inspections to determine the physical condition of selected bridges. The primary bridges to be inspected are the Bourne and Sagamore Highway Bridges spanning the Cape Cod Canal at Bourne, MA, and the Vertical Lift Railroad Bridge spanning the Cape Cod Canal at Buzzards Bay, MA.  The Bourne and Sagamore Bridges are seven-span and three-span, respectively, continuous truss bridges, both with a considerable portion of the 616-foot center span over 100 feet above deck level and with a 135-foot vertical clearance over the canal. Use of aerial lifts, technical rope access techniques, rigging, or combination thereof, will be required to access most areas of the structures involved. Inspection of the above-deck arch portions of both the Bourne and Sagamore Bridges will require a method of access that does not require any traffic control, specifically technical rope access techniques. In most instances, a 'Routine Inspection,' as described in the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Official's (AASHTO) Manual for Condition Evaluation of Bridges, will be the level of inspection required for vehicular bridges.  However, on certain structures 'Initial' or 'In-Depth' inspections may be required. The Vertical Lift Railroad Bridge has a 544-foot lift span flanked by tower spans at each end. With the lift span in the raised position, there is a 135-foot vertical clearance over the canal.  Use of aerial lifts, free climbing, rigging, or a combination thereof, will be required to access the structure. Inspection of the mechanical and electrical components of the Vertical Lift Railroad Bridges operating system will also be required.  In general, a 'Periodic Inspection' as described in the American Railway Engineering and Maintenance-of-Way (AREMA) Manual for Railway Engineering will be the level of inspection required. Underwater inspections may also be required. Draft inspection reports generally will be required within 60 days after completion of physical inspection; final inspection reports generally will be required within 21 days from receipt of draft report comments. Other bridges in the inventory are located at various Corps projects, and range from larger (greater than 100 feet) built-up steel girder bridges over spillways and connecting dam crests to control towers, to smaller concrete or steel bridges within project reservoir areas.  There is also a requirement for a Registered Professional Structural Engineer.  <BR>Personnel must meet the required qualifications set forth in the 'National Bridge Inspection Standards' as published in the Code of Federal Regulations (23 CFR Part 650), the required qualifications as set forth in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Regulation, ER 1110-2-111, 'USACE Bridge Safety Program' and have completed a comprehensive training course based on the 'Bridge Inspectors Reference Manual' from the Federal Highway Administration.  <BR><BR>Interested firms should submit a capabilities package to include the following:  business classification (i.e. HUBZone, etc.), staff size, primary area of contractors expertise, resume of key personnel, and provide examples of projects illustrating the requirements stated above.  Responses are required no later than March 27, 2009.  Responses should be addressed to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District, 696 Virginia Road, Concord, MA  01742-2751, ATTN:  Tina Krawczyk.  Responses shall be limited to twenty pages.  Firms interested shall provide the above documentation in one original form and one copy.  The Government will not pay for any material provided in response to this market survey nor return the data provided.  This notice is for information purposes only and is not a request to be placed on a solicitation mailing list nor is it a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a solicitation.  The results of this survey will be considered to be in effect for a period of one year from the date of this notice.  <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>

<a href="mailto:nadine.vasquez@amedd.army.mil">Center for Health Care Contracting</a>
<DESC>The US Army Medical Command, Center for Health Care Contracting (CHCC), on behalf of San Antonio Military Medical Center (SAMMC) and Medical Education and Training Campus (METC), has developed this Request for Information (RFI) to support two efforts to analyze the anticipated initial outfitting and transition contracts that will assist a medical teaching facility and an operational medical facility to relocate/stand-up as directed by the Defense Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) law. The anticipated contracts would encompass a significant range of performance-based services needed to open a new world class medical teaching facility and healthcare facility. These efforts include, but are not limited to, hospital transition, planning, provisioning/installing materials, provisioning/installing furniture, provisioning/installing medical equipment, and moving medical equipment to support a new teaching facility, a renovated and a new military medical facility in the San Antonio area.   Fort Sam Houston and Camp Bullis are the focal points for the teaching requirements.  Fort Sam Houston and Lackland Air Force Base are the focal points for the medical operational facilities. This RFI is intended to solicit information from industry to assist the Government with analysis of this project and provide commercial insight on holistic performance-based solutions, best practices, possible contractual arrangements and potential issues.<BR><BR>BRAC law requires the two facilities to be operational by 15 September 2011. Historically, providing the resources required to accomplish the significant range of services was accomplished by assigning additional personnel to a specific project site (Health Facility Project Officers), through interim manpower allocations (internal reassignments of in-house staff), or by hiring temporary employees for specific support (logistics managers). While these methods were successful in a low volume environment, they will not support the requirements of SAMMC and METC. Therefore, a new holistic approach is being considered to include a variety of tasks under two contractual vehicles. <BR><BR>The Government desires that respondents offer their experience and recommendations on the following questions and issues related to the initial outfitting and transition of military medical and training facilities. When addressing these items respondents should consider the size and scope of the requirements, which will include the outfitting of two large military installation facilities with fluid construction completion dates that may include the provisioning of approximately  40,000 (notional) items of medical and non-medical furniture/equipment/supplies/materials per contract. <BR><BR>(1) Have other similar (size, scope) initial outfitting and transition projects implemented a holistic approach that includes project management, provision of specified medical, non-medical, IT, and furniture/furnishings, relocation of existing equipment, warehousing of new and existing equipment, installation and technical inspection of equipment, training and turnover of equipment? <BR>(2) Is there a template or format that would best identify outfitting requirements? <BR>(3) Given a list of approximately 80,000 (notional) furniture/equipment/supplies/materials along with standard project management, moving, installation, and training labor costs, what pricing arrangement(s) and method(s) would be best suited for the project? <BR>(4) How would provisioning and installation best be accomplished? Would the company provision and warehouse the items or follow a just-in-time approach to install furniture and equipment with minimal storage time?<BR>(5) What best practices have been implemented for delivery and installation of equipment prior to technical testing and turnover to the customer (i.e., Government)? Does the contractor maintain control of the equipment? How do contractors ensure the security of delivered equipment prior to customer acceptance? Would this security expectation change if the delivery location is a Government installation? <BR>(6) Would a contractor in the initial outfitting and transition competitive space typically provide and install IT equipment to include desktop/laptop computers, printers, scanners, et al, but also provision and install routers, switches, servers? <BR>(7) What tools/methods/capabilities can be implemented to provide web-based tracking access for customers? Is the use of web-based tracking and RFID standard in the industry? If not, would implementing these capabilities be cost prohibitive or otherwise unattainable?<BR>(8) Are there any specialized hazardous material and hazardous transportation issues that need to be addressed for this project considering the provisioning or transportation of medical equipment? Are there any specific insurance or indemnification issues that need to be addressed for this project?<BR>(9) If long-lead-time items are procured under a separate contractual vehicle, would you envision that this contractor (the holistic solution provider) will coordinate and handle the installation and transition of these items? How would this best be accomplished?<BR>(10) What type of acquisition strategy would you recommend for this type of solution? Please include contract type, CLIN structure, pricing and incentive strategies in your response. <BR>(11) If your company has provided clinical transition services to support the outfitting of facilities, what was the extent of those services? <BR>(12) In your past experience with the transitioning of official government records/files, to include patient records and other sensitive protected information, what security measures were implemented to ensure the safeguarding of the files and how was the service executed?<BR>(13) In general, what lessons learned would you offer to the Government as they consider planning for the initial outfitting and transition of these large military medical training/operational facilities? <BR>(14) What issues and stumbling blocks has your company encountered in the past with operational medical/training facility outfitting projects that should be addressed?<BR>(15) Does your company have a current GSA schedule for executing all contemplated services delineated in questions 1 thru 15? <BR><BR>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. It is not a Request for Proposal, a Request for Quotation, an Invitation for Bids, a solicitation, or an indication the Center for Health Care Contracting will contract for the items contained in the RFI. The Government will not pay respondents for information provided in response to this RFI. This RFI is part of a Government market research effort to determine the scope of industry capabilities and interest. <BR>Respondents to this RFI should describe their interest and ability to perform the requirements summarized within this notice. Responses should contain Company Name, Address, Point of Contact, Cage Code, Phone Number, FAX Number, Size of Business pursuant to NAICS code 541614 (size standard $7,000,000) and GSA contract number if any.  Responses should address the companys experience in providing similar initial outfitting and transition support to medical facilities including commercial, military, or other federal government hospitals and treatment facilities. When describing this past experience, a brief description of the size, scope, and complexity of the requirement and the contracting vehicle should be provided. To be of greatest value, responses should address the aforementioned questions and issues. Responses should be formatted as either MS Word (.doc, .docx) or Adobe Portable Document Format (.pdf) and should be limited to a maximum of ten (10) pages. Reponses shall be hand delivered or by courier to the Point of Contact identified in the below section. Proprietary/Competition Sensitive information (appropriately marked) will be protected from disclosure to the greatest extent practical, however it is preferred that respondents do not provide proprietary or otherwise restricted responses. Responses should be submitted no later than 3:00 PM CDST, March 20, 2009. <BR><BR>It is anticipated that any resultant contracts that might result from this survey would have a period of performance from date of award through 15 September 2011.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541614; and the small business size standard is $7.0 MIL.  <BR><BR>Point of Contact: Nadine Vasquez, (210) 295-4346<BR>Email your questions to Center for Health Care Contracting at:<BR>nadine.vasquez@us.army.mil<BR><BR>Contracting Office Address: <BR>Center for Health Care Contracting <BR>ATTN: MCAA-C-PA, Bldg 4197<BR>2107 17th Street, Suite 68<BR>Fort Sam Houston, TX 78234-5068<BR><BR><BR>

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Coast Guard, Maintenance and Logistics Command Atlantic, Norfolk, VA and the United States Coast Guard Academy, Leadership Development  Center (LDC), in  New London, Connecticut are seeking interested sources to provide all labor, supervision, transportation, training aids and training materials, except for facilities furnished by the government, for (1) an innovative Instructor Qualification Course (IQC) in leadership and (2) leadership course training materials for IQC trained instructors to use in subsequent LDC courses.  During the first year of this contract, the courses will be taught at the Leadership Development Center (LDC).  In subsequent years, the government may utilize additional locations.  The audience for the IQC will be Coast Guard officers, enlisted, Auxiliary, and civilian personnel currently assigned to the LDC, New London, CT.  Instructors certified through attendance at the IQC will subsequently teach LDC leadership courses and use the training materials purchased under the resultant contract.  The contracted instructors should have as a minimum, an earned master’s degree, however, an earned doctorate is preferred, and a minimum of three years experience in a leadership position.  BACKGROUND:  The LDC is located at the Coast Guard Academy in New London, CT.  The LDC’s Leadership and Quality Institute (LQI) is responsible for teaching and facilitating courses equivalent to civilian adult continuing professional education.  Over 4,000 students are taught each year in the LQI’s Leadership and Management School; one of six major schools within the LDC.  Many of the officer, enlisted, civilian, and Auxiliary members of the Coast Guard will attend training provided by the LDC’s LQI.  Omnipresent issues related to national security require that the Coast Guard’s leadership training be at the highest possible level appropriate to student experience and responsibilities.  It is necessary to approach Coast Guard leadership training in the same way that civilian corporations advance their employees’ leadership skills.  Rarely do successful civilian corporations have the manpower or materials to identify, design, and deliver their own state-of-the-art leadership curricula.  Civilian corporations contract out for sophisticated leadership training.  The Coast Guard cannot afford to purchase leadership training for all its personnel.  The next best option is to obtain a commercially prepared IQC to meet both the instructor-training requirement and the urgent need for quality in leadership training.  The Coast Guard is currently in the process of developing specific requirements for this course.  It is anticipated that this will be a fixed price contract for the majority of the requirements with travel being performed on a cost reimbursement basis.  The Coast Guard envisions the future contractor having an intricate network of resources to provide all aspects of the leadership training course and materials as described.  No solicitation exists for this requirement, therefore DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on FEDBIZOPS.  It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor this site for release of any future solicitation or synopsis.  CONTRACTOR INFORMATION FOR SUBMISSION:  Interested contractors shall describe how they possess the experience and capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the requirements of providing the following:  1. Instructor Qualification Course in Leadership: a. Innovative Methods, b. Hands on Learning, c. Out of Seat Training, d. Problem Solving Methods, e. Student Centered Learning, f. Exercised Focused Training g. Interactive Scenarios and Role Playing.  2.  Instructors: Demonstrate that instructors possess at a minimum an earned master’s degree, however, an earned doctorate is preferred, and a minimum of three years experience in a leadership position is required.  3.  LDC Instructors at the completion of the IQC will be certified to teach the training materials purchased under the resultant contract in LDC leadership classes.  4.  Leadership Course Training Materials: a. describe your course syllabus, course outline or course curriculum to be utilized.  b. Describe how you have prepared reusable instructor visual aids that reinforce the learning objectives in your course curriculum. c. Describe innovative student-training aids that will be effective in helping LDC students remember and implement learning objectives at their job sites. d. Describe student textbooks/workbooks that can be used by students who will be attending the LDC classes taught by the IQC trained instructors.  5.  Provide a project plan timeline or methodology outlining the necessary steps or milestones needed to implement an innovative and effective IQC.  DEMONSTRATION OF THE FOLLOWING IS RECOMMENDED, BUT NOT REQUIRED.  6.  Past experience in providing an instructor qualification course in leadership training for other Government Agencies.  7.  Past experience in providing an instructor qualification course in leadership training for other Universities or Colleges.  8. Past experience in providing an instructor qualification course in leadership training for other Coast Guard Commands.  9.  Past experience in providing an instructor qualification course in leadership training for other organizations.  The above information can be forwarded to the Contract Specialist via e-mail at wendy.j.culbreth@uscg.mil.  Responses should also include the following information:  company name, address, point of contact, phone number; DUNS number, business size to include status ( 8(a), SDB, HUBZONE, SDVOSB, etc), corporate affiliations, potential joint venture partners, teaming partners, or major subcontractors, GSA Contract information if applicable.  All relevant input is encouraged.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited; no basis for claim against the Government shall arise as a result from a response to this Sources Sought or Government use of any information provided.  The Government reserves the right to consider a small business, 8(a) or any other set aside arrangement as deemed appropriate for this procurement.

<DESC>The government currently intends to reserve this contract action for Small Business. The government is seeking sources for the delivery and installation of three (3) Mobile Platform Power Generators, heavy duty version and three (3) Vehicle/Vessel Integrated Primary Electrical Resource (VIPER) units.   These devices are similar to the alternator on a motor vehicle except that they produce AC and DC power using the vehicle's engine that can operate standard power tools on the ranges.  The location and isolation of BT-11 amplifies the difficulties involved in transporting supplies and equipment used to maintain the targets located throughout the island. Access to the target areas is difficult and maintenance personnel must get from the marsh to the catwalks approximately five feet above water level. Maintenance personnel for reasons of safety and to meet environmental requirements must report fuel and gasoline spills in the marsh. Having power generating equipment perman! ently installed on the amphibious heavy equipment removes the risk of injury from fire and gasoline exposure created with portable generators and eliminates spills into the marsh.
The generator shall produce at least 5 KW continuous power and produce high quality AC or DC power, selectable.  It shall be completely integrated into the vehicle, under the hood for transparent operation.  It shall require no special handling or preparation and no scheduled maintenance.  It shall provide on-demand power, continuously as needed over the complete range of vehicle operation whether parked, mobile and engine idle to red-line RPMs.  It shall create no noise above the normal engine operation.   It shall be about 12 inches in diameter, 5 inches in width and weigh about 60 pounds.  It shall operate in all normal temperatures from -40 - 125 degrees F.
The award will be approximately $30,000 with an anticipated delivery date of 90 days after contract award.  This is not a request for quotations or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation.  It should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the US Government to issue a solicitation.  Any information provided to the Government in response to this RFI will become USMC property and will not be returned.  All proprietary or classified information will be treated appropriately.  Written response is requested within 15 days after publication of this notice. 
NO PHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED

<DESC>The government currently intends to reserve this contract action for Small Business.  The government is seeking sources for the fabrication and delivery of an ammunition disposal trailer for delivery to MCB Camp Butler, Okinawa, Japan.  The MCBJ EOD team supports Okinawa ranges operations with UXO removal due to our specific location and non-availability of commercial UXO removal teams.  The EOD team detonates a significant amount of small arms ammunition (grade III) yearly from UXO removal.  Okinawa's fire conditions ratings often require the removal/delinking of tracers from belt ammunition.  The tracer ammunition (code H) is then stored until a significant amount is stockpiled, before being shipped stateside for destruction.  Ammunition destruction is an ITS standard for Ammunition Technicians (MOS 2311).
The ammunition disposal trailer shall be capable of disposing ammunition up to 50 caliber in amounts of 50-70 pounds at a time.  It shall be about six feet high, six feet wide and 14 feet long and shall not exceed 4000 pounds gross vehicle weight.  It shall be roadworthy and comply with all department of transportation lighting and safety standards.  It shall be fueled by LP gas and provide for safe, contained disposal by having heavy, solid and durable construction.  It shall be painted with rust inhibitive primer and high heat paint.  It shall have tandem axels and be capable of being towed by a HWMVV using a military pintle hitch.  It shall have a mounted spare tire and a mounted tool box stocked with the tools necessary for routine maintenance of the trailer and its components.  The trailer will be used to burn grade III and code H ammunition and will not be used to burn high explosives.
The award will be approximately $15,000 with an anticipated delivery date of 90 days after contract award.  This is not a request for quotations or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation.  It should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the US Government to issue a solicitation.  Any information provided to the Government in response to this RFI will become USMC property and will not be returned.  All proprietary or classified information will be treated appropriately.  Written response is requested within 15 days after publication of this notice.

<DESC>Reynard Proposers’ Day Conference

The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) will host a Proposers’ Day Conference for the Reynard Program on April 3, 2009 in anticipation of the release of a new solicitation in support of the program. The Conference will be held from 8:00am to 4:00pm in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. The purpose of the conference will be to provide information on the Reynard Program, to address questions from potential proposers, and to provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.

SYNOPSIS
This announcement serves as a pre-solicitation notice and is issued solely for information and planning purposes. The Proposers’ Day Conference does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals or proposal abstracts. Conference attendance is voluntary and is not required to propose to future solicitations (if any) associated with this program. The Reynard Proposers’ Day is open to all researchers interested in submitting to the anticipated Reynard Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). Note that the Proposers’ Day is intended for participants from industry and academia; it is not intended for parties who are not interested in bidding or participating on a bidding team, e.g. the public or members of the press. Government attendees will be invited separately.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND GOALS
Events in today’s world move at an accelerating pace, and are often shaped by information (whether correct or incorrect) that is communicated by diverse and increasingly novel means. A nuanced picture of events and attitudes is required to inform policy developers and other decision-makers in this complex and fast-paced environment. IARPA sponsors leading-edge research to help the Intelligence Community keep abreast of the many sources of information needed to inform our nation’s leadership. A new channel for information exchange and social interaction is emerging with the growing popularity of Virtual Worlds (VWs) and Massive Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs). Industry experts predict the number of VW users will exceed a half billion by the end of 2009. As participation in these VWs broadens and deepens, the need for understanding the nature of interactions in these worlds arises.
Starting from the premise that Real World (RW) characteristics are reflected in VW behavior, the IARPA Reynard program seeks to identify behavioral indicators in VWs and MMOGs that are related to the RW characteristics of the users. Performers in the Reynard program will be expected to produce one or more VW behavioral indicators that serve to identify RW attributes of individuals or groups. Attributes of interest include the following: gender, approximate age, economic status, educational level, occupation, ideology or “world view”, degree of influence, “digital native” vs “digital immigrant,” approximate physical geographic location, native language, and culture. Other RW characteristics might also be empirically deduced through behavioral indicators. VW behavioral indicators may be examined in the areas of Avatars and Representation, Communication, Things That Avatars Do, Group Formation and Dynamics, Money and Economics, and Cultural Differences.

Collaborative efforts/teaming among potential performers will be strongly encouraged. It is anticipated that teams will be multidisciplinary with social scientists, computer scientists, statisticians, gaming and virtual world experts, and multi-cultural experts, as appropriate. IARPA anticipates that universities and companies from around the world will participate in this fascinating area of research. Researchers will be able to publish their findings in publicly-available, academic journals.

REGISTRATION INFORMATION
If you would like to attend, please submit your request to the Proposers’ Day Website: http://conference.brtrc.com/reynard. Attendees must register no later than 5:00pm EST March 30, 2009. Directions to the conference facility and other materials are available on the website.
Due to space limitations, attendance will be limited to the first 200 registrants and to no more than 2 representatives per organization. All attendees will be required to present a government-issued photo identification to enter the conference.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Attendees who wish to present organization capabilities for potential teaming opportunities may request to do so by sending an e-mail to dni-iarpa-baa-09-05@ugov.gov. Presentations will be limited to 5 minutes with a maximum of 5 slides that must follow a template that will be provided (MS PowerPoint or PDF format). Only one presentation per organization will be allowed. Deadline for requests is close of business (5:00pm EST) March 27, 2009. It is the presenter’s responsibility to ensure that all materials briefed are appropriately marked and approved for presentation by their organization.

<DESC>NASA intends to extend Contract NNA05BE29C with L-3 Communications VertexAerospace, LLC. on a sole-source basis pursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), Only OneResponsible Source.  The objective is to extend the period of performance period for fourmonths. The current Contractor provides aircraft services for aircraft operations, maintenanceand research at NASA Ames Research Center, as well as operation of the Moffett FederalAirfield.  These services will support research, technical investigations, scientificstudies, airworthiness activities, flight operations and safe and efficient operation ofthe Federal Airfield.  The services required involve the following technical areas: mechanical systems, electrical/electronics systems, instrumentation, software and datasystems to support NASA Ames Research Center.  This extension will allow for acontinuation of services to ensure program continuity and critical mission support andavoid significant technical impacts while a competitive follow-on acquisition iscompleted. The extension will extend the period of performance of the current contract, NNA05BE29C,for a period of four months, June 1,2009 through September 30, 2009, and increase thecontract value for the period of the extension.  The current contractor, L-3, isconsidered the only contractor that can meet ARC's needs given the short periodperformance for the extension.	Awarding a four month contract to another source, at thesame time evaluations in support of the recompetition of the follow-on contract is inprocess, would not allow for a sufficient phase-in period, thereby affecting the seamlesscontinuity of services and causing unacceptable delays in fulfilling ARC's requirements.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact no later 4:00 PM PST on March 23,2009.  Such capabilities and qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purposes ofdetermining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

EVALUATION—COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)

The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

Price

Technical and delivery, when combined, are ____N/A______when compared to price.

A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

PROMPT PAYMENT TERMS

INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS

A. Systems Submission of Invoices. 

 Invoice submission is a two step process:

The Vendor shall develop an Acceptance Information document in IT Solutions Shop (ITSS) and attach a copy of invoice with all required back-up documentation.

     Current ITSS web site https://it-solutions.gsa.gov

The Vendor shall also complete the invoice form on the Finance web site and attach soft copy of invoice.  This is the official system of record; the invoice will not be processed for payment unless this process is completed.  

     Current General Services Administration (GSA) Finance web site is www.finance.gsa.gov.  Go to
    http://finance.gsa.gov/password/ to obtain Password/Sign-Up for Email Notification.

B. Invoice Submission Process.

•	Submit each invoice only once.  Submitting multiple copies confuses and delays processing.

•	If editing is required, update the first submission; don’t create a second invoice submission.

•	Make sure the invoice amount and the acceptance document amount are the same.

•	Use the invoice number for both the Finance and ITSS submission.  Don’t use voucher numbers.  Always enter the invoice number on the Acceptance document in ITSS.  The invoice number must be identical in both sites.

•	Do not use special characters in the invoice number, only alpha and/or numeric.  No spaces in invoice number.

•	If an invoice is rejected, a corrected invoice will be submitted using the original invoice number with some type of unique identifier attached; i.e. “R” to denote resubmission which will make the invoice number unique.  Each invoice submission must have an invoice number that is unique.

•	In addition, the contractor is responsible for ensuring client acceptance of invoice. This can be accomplished in ITSS or contractor may have client sign a hard copy of invoice prior to attaching to the Acceptance Information document in ITSS.

•	Invoice must be submitted in ITSS on Acceptance Information document and include copy of invoice and required back-up attached.

C. Timing of invoices.

Invoices shall be submitted for payment of deliverables that have been completed and accepted by the Contracting Officer Representative (COR).

For Firm Fixed Price (FFP), this will be a completed and accepted deliverable.  Evidence that the COR accepted the deliverable must be present before the GSA Project Manager (PM) can proceed.  Ensure the invoice is submitted in accordance with the established payment schedule.  

For Time and Material (T&M), this will be a month’s worth of services.  The COR will certify that the contractor has performed in accordance with the statement of work and the government has received the hours and/or materials billed by the contractor.  Ensure the requirements of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.232-7, Payments under Time-and-Materials and Labor-Hour Contracts, are fully complied with.  GSA PM will certify the invoice for payment.

D. Payment of Invoices.

Payment of invoices shall be based on the quality of the invoiced deliverable.  If the invoiced deliverable does not meet the established contractual standards, the invoice will not be paid until the deliverable has been determined to meet the established standards, as applicable.

	The contractor is reminded that invoices will be submitted In accordance with (IAW) FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions – Commercial Items, paragraph g, which states the following:  
52.212-4(g) Invoice.

(x) Electronic funds transfer (EFT) banking information.
(A) The Contractor shall include EFT banking information on the invoice only if required elsewhere in this contract.

(ix)  The provision at FAR 52.212-2, titled, "Evaluation of Commercial Items" (JAN 1999), is applicable to this acquisition.  

The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes and are listed in descending order of importance:

TECHNICAL UNDERSTANDING:
To determine technical merit, each quotation will be evaluated against the requirements listed in this solicitation. All vendors offering an "Equal To" product must provide supporting documentation that their product can meet the requirements listed in this solicitation.  1)  The proposals will be graded subjectively with final scores of, “Acceptable”, or “Unacceptable”.  A score of “Acceptable” would mean that the proposed product fully met the requirements.  An “Unacceptable” score means that the offer will not be considered for award.

PRICE:

The Government will evaluate proposed prices for a base period plus two options.  Price is of less importance than technical capabilities and past performance combined.  Award will not be automatically made on the basis of the highest technical merit. However price may become an important factor as the degree of equality between technical proposals becomes closer.  FAR Provision 52.217-5, Evaluation of Options (Jul 1990) applies to this procurement.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

PAST PERFORMANCE: 
Vendors should provide two references of similar efforts performed during the last three years. This will include a description of the project, project title, contract number, contract amount, client identification including agency or company name, contracting and technical reviewing official name(s), address and telephone number. The government is seeking to determine whether an offeror has consistently demonstrated a strong commitment to customer satisfaction and high performance of services.  This is a matter of judgment.  The government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror.  Performance risks are those associated with an offeror’s likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offeror’s past performance record.  Rating of positive, neutral, and poor will be given.  A positive past performance will take precedence over neutral or poor past performance.  Neutral past performance takes precedence over poor past performance.  A contractor with no past performance will be given a score of neutral, which will neither be used to the advantage nor disadvantage of the offeror. The Government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror.  Performance risks are those associated with an offeror’s likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offeror’s record of past performance. 

(x) Vendors shall complete FAR 52.212-3, Offerors Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (FEB 2009).   This can be done electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov.  The contracting officer will review the vendor’s online certifications at http://orca.bpn.gov to ensure that they are accurate and complete.  If the vendor does not have active representations and certifications registered online they will be disqualified from being considered for award.

(xi) The clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items (OCT 2008), applies to this acquisition. 

(xii) The clause FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items (FEB 2009), applies to this acquisition as well as the following clauses cited therein:

<DESC>This BAA is being issued to allow continuous submission of abstracts and proposals to IARPA that do not address topics currently covered by open IARPA solicitations. Submission of abstracts is STRONGLY encouraged in advance of full proposals in order for IARPA to provide potential offerors with an indication of the relevance and acceptability of their technical ideas under this BAA.

This announcement seeks research ideas for topics not addressed by ongoing IARPA programs or other published IARPA solicitations. Potential offerors are highly encouraged to review the current IARPA solicitation list at http://www.iarpa.gov/solicitations.html to avoid proposing efforts that are responsive to other IARPA solicitations. This BAA is primarily, but not solely, intended for early stage research that may lead to larger, focused programs in the future. (IARPA commonly refers to these early stage research efforts as “seedlings”.)

<p>FERC's NATURAL GAS ENVIRONMENTAL TRAINING SEMINARS STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>Purpose:</p>
<p>To provide contracted services for: (1) the preparation and presentation of training seminars relating to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) or Commission natural gas environmental program.</p>
<p>Objective:<br />The Commission is an independent regulatory agency charged with regulating various aspects of the nation's interstate natural gas infrastructure, including regulating the interstate transportation of natural gas and approving the construction of interstate natural gas pipelines, liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals and underground storage.</p>
<p>If an applicant proposes to abandon, construct or operate interstate natural gas facilities, it must secure approval from FERC, in the form of a certificate of public convenience and necessity (certificate) pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act (NGA) for pipeline or storage facilities or an authorization to construct and site a new LNG import terminal pursuant to Section 3 of the NGA.</p>
<p>In order to gain FERC's approval to construct any interstate natural gas related facilities, companies must file and application. FERC will then complete an environmental analysis of that application in which the Commission will use staff's findings to assist their determination on whether to approve or deny a certificate or authorization for the project. If the Commission approves the project the certificate or authorization may include certain conditions, in which the applicant must comply with in order for FERC to authorize construction of the project.</p>
<p>Once the project is authorized, the applicant must adhere to certain construction related conditions during construction of its pipeline project and land restoration processes of the affected environment. FERC has the responsibility of monitoring the project to ensure that the pipeline/facilities are constructed as authorized and that the environment is appropriately restored. FERC completes on-site inspections both during construction to monitor compliance with construction conditions and after construction to monitor restoration of the right-of-way.</p>

(Only applies if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) Are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) or have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) or are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) or have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.

(End of provision)
NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 

Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC><p><br />W912DY-08-R-0021<br />INDEFINITE DELIVERY CONTRACT FOR MEDICAL FACILITIES A-E SERVICES - UNRESTRICTED COMPETITION<br />________________________________________</p>
<p>Description<br />CONTRACT INFORMATION: This contract is being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR 36.6. Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. Architectural Engineering services are required to support the Department of Defense Medical (DoDM) program Medical Facilities A-E Services (MFAES) requirements. Huntsville Center is the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Medical Facilities Mandatory Center of Expertise and Standardization (MX), and partners with the Corps' project delivery teams, regional business centers/divisions, stakeholders and geographical districts to provide medical expertise and the highest quality medical and medical research facility life cycle support to the Department of Defense (DoD), other federal agencies and foreign governments. The DoDM program funds Army, Air Force and Navy medical treatment, housing, and research facilities. Since originally directed by Congress and established in 1978, the MX has the responsibility to develop medical design and construction policies, technical guidance, procedures, criteria, specifications, and standards that integrate medical unique design, construction and operational requirements. In order to accomplish this objective, the Huntsville Center proposes to award a Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC). Each award will be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract, with a base year and four option years, under which firm-fixed price (FFP) task orders will be negotiated. Contracts are anticipated to be awarded with FY09's, 4th quarter funds. The North American Industrial Classification System code is 541330 and the size standard is $4,500,000.00. The total requirements expected to be awarded under the MFAES Unrestricted A-E contracts are anticipated to equal approximately $234,000,000.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 36.209, the A-E Contractor and its subcontractors, suppliers, and consultants selected for award will not be considered eligible for a DoDM construction (with design-build capabilities) contract. The Government will provide each awardee a fair opportunity to be considered for each task order exceeding $3,000 issued under the multiple ID/IQ A-E contracts, unless an exemption provided in FAR 16.505(b)(2) applies. The Government may not contact each of the multiple awardees under the contract before selecting an order awardee. Large businesses must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on that part of the work it intends to subcontract. The extent of participation of such firms in terms of the value of the total acquisition will be evaluated. The plan should detail the proposed participation percentages, or lack thereof. CEHNC has established small business goals as an assistance to assure small business receives a fair portion of awards. The goals for the unrestricted portion of this procurement are as follows: Small Business: 7% of total contract value; Small Disadvantaged Business: 6.2% of the total contract value; Woman-Owned Small Business: 7% of the total contract value; Historically Underutilized Business Zone Small Business: 9.8% of the total contract value; Veteran Owned Small Business: 3% of the total contract value; Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business: 0.9% of the total contact value. The plan is not required with this submittal, but will be required with the proposal of the firm selected for negotiations.</p>
<p>PROJECT INFORMATION: The Medical Facility A-E Services contracts will set forth the general requirements for the performance of various services in support of the DoDM Program to include planning, survey, energy conservation and analyses studies, and other investigations/studies; comprehensive interior designs; development of Request For Proposal (RFP); and design services related to new construction, upgrade, maintenance, and repair of various medical facilities, including related infrastructure systems, medical equipment planning and components worldwide. The design of complex healthcare related facilities and laboratories is an integral part of this requirement. The CEHNC Design Manual (CEHNC 1110-1-1) and Unified Facilities Criteria for Medical Military Facilities (UFC 4-510-01) detail the specific design standards and processes associated with this acquisition for planning, design, construction, sustainment, restoration, and modernization criteria. In addition, the UFC Antiterrorism Force Protection Standards must be followed. The A-E must be able to provide design considerations for facilities related to healthcare planning. Work may include preparation of design tools, design criteria documents, studies, cost estimates (parametric and quantity take off), interim life safety plans, commissioning plans, facility demolition plans that include hazardous waste identification and removal procedures, concept designs, final designs, construction phase services, and technical review of designs prepared by others.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR Part 16.505(a)(8)(ii) and DFARS clause 252.236-7009, Option for Supervision and Inspection Services, the Government may direct the Contractor to perform any part or all of the supervision and inspection services for the construction contract.</p>
<p>Criteria and design tools may include such work as updates to the military medical equipment planning system and medical criteria; update or preparation of specifications; and, preparation of Design-Build Requests for Proposals (RFPs). Studies may include such work as: surveying existing medical facilities for architectural, structural, utility system, life safety and fire safety code deficiencies; site analysis will comprise topographic surveys and subsurface investigations; preparation of planning and programming documents and economic analyses for additions, alterations, and replacement facility projects; preparation of Statement of Condition surveys for Joint Commission Accreditation Review; permits; and, architectural renderings. Design efforts may include new facilities, additions, alterations, interior design, renovations and upgrades to existing facilities. Construction phase services may include post construction award services, commissioning, and shop drawing review. Studies and designs will be prepared in the English and/or metric system of measurement. Cost estimates will be prepared on IBM-compatible personal computers using Corps of Engineers' Computer Aided Cost Estimating System: software provided by the Government, PACES Cost Estimating System, or similar software. Design drawings will be produced in a format fully compatible with the latest versions of Microstation and Autocad at time of contract award. Building Information Modeling (BIM) capability is a requirement.

In addition there has been a change to the listing of personnel in the Selection Criteria section, paragraph b. The safety engineer discipline has been removed.<br />Description<br />CONTRACT INFORMATION: This contract is being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR 36.6. Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. Architectural Engineering services are required to support the Department of Defense Medical (DoDM) program Medical Facilities A-E Services (MFAES) requirements. Huntsville Center is the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Medical Facilities Mandatory Center of Expertise and Standardization (MX), and partners with the Corps' project delivery teams, regional business centers/divisions, stakeholders and geographical districts to provide medical expertise and the highest quality medical and medical research facility life cycle support to the Department of Defense (DoD), other federal agencies and foreign governments. The DoDM program funds Army, Air Force and Navy medical treatment, housing, and research facilities. Since originally directed by Congress and established in 1978, the MX has the responsibility to develop medical design and construction policies, technical guidance, procedures, criteria, specifications, and standards that integrate medical unique design, construction and operational requirements. In order to accomplish this objective, the Huntsville Center proposes to award a Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC). Each award will be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract, with a base year and four option years, under which firm-fixed price (FFP) task orders will be negotiated. Contracts are anticipated to be awarded with FY09's, 4th quarter funds. The North American Industrial Classification System code is 541330 and the size standard is $4,500,000.00. The total requirements expected to be awarded under these Restricted MFAES A-E contracts are anticipated to equal approximately $15,000,000.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 36.209, the A-E Contractor and its subcontractors, suppliers, and consultants selected for award will not be considered eligible for a DoDM construction (with design-build capabilities) contract. The Government will provide each awardee a fair opportunity to be considered for each task order exceeding $3,000 issued under the multiple ID/IQ A-E contracts, unless an exemption provided in FAR 16.505(b)(2) applies. The Government may not contact each of the multiple awardees under the contract before selecting an order awardee.</p>

Design efforts may include new facilities, additions, alterations, interior design, renovations, and upgrades to existing facilities. Construction phase services may include post construction award services, commissioning, and shop drawing review. Studies and designs will be prepared in the English and/or metric system of measurement. Cost estimates will be prepared on IBM-compatible personal computers using Corps of Engineers' Computer Aided Cost Estimating System: software provided by the Government, PACES Cost Estimating System, or similar approved software. Design drawings will be produced in a format fully compatible with the latest versions of Microstation and Autocad at time of contract award. Building Information Modeling (BIM) capability is a requirement. Knowledge and experience with Evidenced Based Design, Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), and other sustainable design &amp; energy conservation legislation is required.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command is seeking proposals from business entities interested in participating in an unrestricted acquisition for a Firm Fixed Price contract under FAR Part 13.5. The United States Navy intends to procure a conveyor system for optical fabrication for the Naval Ophthalmic Support and Traing Activity, 160 Main Road, St., Bldg 1794 Ste 360, Yorktown VA 23691.

Solicitation N62645-09-R-0016 is expected to be issued March 6, 2009 with an estimated closing date of April 13, 2009. The acquisition will be solicited as a Request for Proposal. Delivery is CONUS, source inspection is required. Delivery schedule is estimated to be 1 May, 2009. The solicitation will be evaluated with Technical and Past Performance of equal importance and more important than price.  

All proposals will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis of the minimum requirement of the salient characteristics. Salient characteristics will be evaluated individually on a pass/fair basis.  If an offeror’s proposal is judged to have failed any one for the salient characteristics the firm’s offer will receive no further consideration for award. If  only one proposal is judged to have passed all salient characteristics then the offeror  proposal will subsequently be evaluated on past performance and price. Should more then one proposal pass all salient characteristics the Government then intends to award a contract to the responsible offeror whose offer is the Best Value to the government. The technical and past performance factors are of equal importance and when combined are more important than price.   Price may become a critical factor in the event that two or more offerors are determined to be essentially equal following the evaluation of technical and past performance factors.  Evaluation of price will be based on the offeror’s total price for all line items as delivered to Yorktown, VA.

DEMONSTRATION OBJECTIVES
1)	Develop and integrate an Airworthy ASDRS into the existing ARS system on the F/A-18E/F platform that will support both manned and unmanned refueling demonstrations.  
2)	Demonstrate reduction of drogue motion bandwidth (frequency and amplitude) as compared to a standard drogue at representative F/A-18 E/F aerial refueling altitudes and airspeeds under normal atmospheric conditions. Under these conditions, the ASDRS shall support repeated, successful plugs by surrogate and X-47B receiver aircraft.  Moderate turbulence conditions, if not demonstrated in flight, shall be demonstrated via analysis.
3)	Demonstrate accuracy, integrity, continuity and availability of the drogue position sensing function relative to the tanker (integrity, continuity and availability are demonstrated by analysis with verification of assumptions via flight test).
4)	Demonstrate ability of the drogue stabilization function to hold the drogue relative to a predetermined point (nominally the natural trail point of the drogue), including compensating for biases such as those caused by receiver forebody effects and other disturbances such as turbulence, tanker-induced motion, etc.
5)	Support safe and effective demonstration with multiple probe and drogue refueling systems/ operations (manned and unmanned), to include the transfer of fuel with: 
•	Probe-equipped Navy aircraft (piloted refueling)
•	Probe-equipped UAS Surrogate such as an F/A-18 C/D (automatic control refueling)
•	X-47B (autonomous refueling)
6)	Optional Objectives
•	Ability to integrate the ASDRS into other drogue-equipped tanker systems (such as commercial Omega tankers) to support demonstration
•	Consideration of stabilization modes for the ASDRS (e.g., inertial vs tanker body stabilization, considerations of wing-mounted systems, compensation for tanker motion)

DESIGN/ TECHNICAL OBJECTIVES
1)	Integration Objectives

b.	The controlling mechanism and sensor package (actuators, sensor apertures, etc) shall minimize susceptibility to strike/impact damage
c.	The ASDRS shall be designed to minimize Foreign Object Debris/Damage (FOD) probability.  
d.	Integrity to detect when the system should not be used with the control system enabled
e.	Integrity to detect when the drogue positioning information is invalid (Performance estimation and Fault detection functions) 
f.	Capability to be safely used in a system off state for both manned and unmanned receivers.
g.	Capability to be used with the position sensing function only (active stabilization disabled)
h.	Safe failure/ degraded modes of control system operation

NOTE: (1) The I-9 must be provided before a badge will be issued for unclassified contract work, for acc! ess to the shipyard. (2) If the contract requires access to classified material, a visit request identifying the employee's clearance status may suffice depending on the employee's status within the JPAS database. (3) In the case of contractor truck drivers, knowing some are owner operators, if they are carrying proof of citizenship they can be issued a badge for access to drop off/pick up material. (4) If the truck driver does not have sufficient documentation and the sponsor is willing to escort the driver to/from the desired location, a by-escort badge may be issued.

The additional documentation can be a birth certificate, passport or other official military documentation of United States citizenship. Once presented, it will be entered in the database and be ava! ilable for future use so this step will not be required to be repeated. If the person for whom the vendor/contractor is requesting a badge is a naturalized United States citizen, that person SHALL BRING THEIR ORIGINAL NATURALIZATION papers with them to the pass office in addition to the aforementioned company letter. Once presented, it will be entered in the database and be available for future use so this step will not be required to be repeated. ******* End of Combined Synopsis/Solicitation ********

<CONTACT>JOHN S. POWELL, Contract Specialist, Phone: 919-541-3651, E-Mail: powell.john@epa.gov
<DESC>This announcement is for market research and does NOT constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Request for Information (RFI), or to otherwise pay for the information solicited. This RFI is issued for the purpose of gaining knowledge regarding the various types of environmentally friendly shuttle bus services available.
One shuttle bus would be required with seating capacity of approximately 20 passengers plus 2 wheelchairs. Buses must be accessible to individuals with disabilities. A back-up bus must also be available in case the main bus cannot be used.
The current contract for Shuttle Buses on the Environmental Protection Agency campus at Research Triangle Park utilizes buses run on only on gasoline. In keeping with the EPAs mission, it is desired that the new contract utilize environmentally friendly vehicles. Furthermore, the current contract leases and maintains the vehicles while a separate contract provides drivers of the vehicles. It is the agencys desire to combine these into one turn-key contract. 
The agency is interested in receiving information regarding companies that can provide environmentally friendly shuttle bus vehicles along with the required maintenance and drivers for the vehicles.
The primary function of the new contract would be to run a continuous loop on the Environmental Protection Agency campus at Research Triangle Park.  The route is approximately 3 miles and would be run from 5 AM to 6 PM each business day.  
Although a hybrid vehicle (i.e. gas-electric) is the agencys preference, the term environmentally friendly can include various factors including the use of alternative fuels or anything else that can be shown to have less of a carbon footprint than typical gas operated vehicles of the same size. 
A demonstration of bus capabilities on our campus at Research Triangle Park would be welcomed. If a company wishes to set up such a demonstration please contact the contract specialist listed below.
The EPA requests that information on companies providing the above services be provided no later than March 13, 2009. Please include description of vehicles, driving services and maintenance information along with information regarding vendors business status (e.g. large, small, small disadvantage, minority-owned, 8(a), SDVOB, etc.).

All proposed solution must be able to accept the legacy data streams from the mainframe. Capability to export output to PDF formats preferred.<br />Question - what are the output formats of the legacy data streams coming from the mainframe? <br />RESPONSE: The output formats of the legacy data streams are line print data -132 standard landscape reports from an IBM mainframe.</p>
<p>3. Statement: The line print data streams are processed through an interface software package, PME, and placed in the JES output queue ready for microfiche processing.<br />Question: Can you provide additional information on capabilities of PME?<br />RESPONSE: The PME software determines the formatting of the job on the microfiche - start/stop/ carriage controls.</p>
<p>4. Statement: Microfiche and microfilm is sent to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) in St. Louis, Missouri for long-term storage<br />Questions: What percentage is sent to NARA? Will the data be allowed to transit a data network?<br />RESPONSE: About 60% of the current microfiche is shipped to NARA. We would consider any proposals to transfer the data electronically.</p>
<p>5. Question: Is there a preference for media type with the new system?<br />RESPONSE: No, we are looking for all recommendations.</p>
<p>6. Statement: Output data must be organized and indexed for easy retrieval<br />Question: Are there preferred databases?<br />RESPONSE: We are more interested in a product that will best fit our overall functionality.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE TO DOWNLOAD.  ALL INFORMATION REQUIRED TO SUBMIT SF330 DOCUMENTS IS CONTAINED HEREIN.  This is an announcement for a contracting opportunity under the Brooks Act for architect-engineering services.  This procurement will be evaluated using Brooks Act (PL-92-582) procedures.  THIS IS AN UNRESTRICTED ACQUISITION OPEN TO ALL BUSINESSES CONCERNS.  Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 36.6 selection rules apply.  The purpose of this contract is to provide Architect-Engineer (A-E) design services for Air Force Projects east of the Cascades within the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Seattle District boundaries.  However, work may also be performed anywhere within any of the four states listed including west of the Cascades as applicable.  Services will be required for architectural, landscaping, civil, mechanical, electrical and structural engineering design related to the USACE Seattle District mission in support of the Air Force and other agencies.  Incidental asbestos and lead paint survey work may be required relating to the design services.  The A-E will be required to prepare, using current Air Force, Corps of Engineers and other agency standards, plans, specifications, design analyses, and cost estimates, as required for a variety of major Air Force military construction and other projects, as well as for maintenance, repair, and alteration projects.  Some task orders will involve preparation of request for proposals (RFPs) for design build contracts.  Services shall be accomplished in the contractors office with the exception of such field investigations and field surveys as are required at the project site. The Government will not provide any direct supervision of the Architect/Engineer (A/E) employees.  SELECTION CRITERIA:  The selection criteria for this project are listed below in descending order of importance.  Criteria (1) through (5) are PRIMARY criteria and will be evaluated for all firms.  Criteria (6) through (8) are SECONDARY criteria and shall only be used as tie-breakers should the application of criteria numbers (1) through (5) result in firms being rated as technically equal.  PRIMARY Criteria: (1) SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE and TECHNICAL COMPETENCE of the proposed firm(s).  Provide representative examples of completed projects in the areas of military design and construction for projects such as fitness centers, community activity centers, recreational facilities, military family housing,  dormitories, administrative and training buildings, hangars and maintenance shops and airfields and airfield lighting.  Projects completed on a military installation and those requiring anti-terrorism/force protection (AT/FP) criteria knowledge may be evaluated more favorably for this criteria.  Projects that include experience and demonstrated technical competence in one or more of the following are considered similar projects and may be evaluated more favorably for this criterion: fitness centers, community activity centers, recreational facilities, military projects, housing developments, dormitories, maintenance and fuel cell repair hangars, maintenance shops, and office buildings.  (2) PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS of key personnel to be assigned to this contract, which are necessary for satisfactory performance of the type of work requirements listed in Criterion (1), as demonstrated by education and professional registration and/or certification, specific to architectural and engineering disciplines, including: civil, structural, electrical, mechanical, environmental, architectural and interior design, sustainable design and cost engineering.

Key personnel are defined as lead designers for key disciplines, Project Manager and Quality Control Manager to be assigned to this contract.  Key personnel proposed are required to be licensed or certified professionals, as applicable.  The evaluation is to consider education, training, registration, overall and relevant experience and longevity with firm.  Provide an organization chart identifying each member of the project team.  As a minimum, key personnel must be included.  Indicate the branch office location of each team member.  (3) PAST PERFORMANCE of the project team on similar projects by the proposed key personnel (as described in Criterion (2) above) in terms of quality of work, cost control, and compliance with performance schedules.  Referenced projects that were performed by key personnel under the proposed team structure may receive a higher evaluation under this criterion.  Provide representative examples of completed projects in the areas of military design and construction for projects such as fitness centers, community activity centers, recreational facilities, military family housing, dormitories, administrative and training buildings, hangars and maintenance shops and airfields and airfield lighting. Past performance ratings for projects completed on a military installation and those requiring anti-terrorism/force protection (AT/FP) criteria knowledge may be rated more favorably for this criteria.  Include the clients name, phone number and address for each submitted project example.  Past performance of the prime contractor will be evaluated using the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) databases. Government databases will be checked and previous customers may be contacted as references. All performance ratings in PPIRS for the past three (3) years shall be considered. Offerors are encouraged to review their PPIRS records by visiting http://www.ppirs.gov/.  This website has information on obtaining access to a firms record, if they currently do not have access. (4) CAPACITY of the proposed team to accomplish approximately the work of the required type and the dollar amount stated in a one-year period. The evaluation will consider the availability of an adequate number of personnel in key disciplines of the team for effective functioning as a Project Delivery Team (PDT).

(5) KNOWLEDGE OF THE LOCALITY of the contract as it relates to engineering design, particularly east of the Cascades in Idaho, Oregon, Montana and Washington.   Information provided must demonstrate expertise in geological features, climatic conditions, and/or local construction methods.  SECONDARY Criteria:  (6) EXTENT OF SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION (including Women-Owned Small Businesses (WOSB), Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB), historically black colleges and universities, and minority institutions) in the proposed contract team, measured as a percentage of the total estimated effort.  (7) GEOGRAPHICAL PROXIMITY to the USACE Seattle District office and its engineering and construction personnel located in the four covered states (Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington).  (8) EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF THE WORK.  List the total amount (dollar value) of Department of Defense (DoD) contract awards as the prime contractor within the past twelve (12) months.  GENERAL INFORMATION: This announcement will result in the award of one fixed-price indefinite quantity contract. The effective period of the contract shall be a two year base period, a total aggregate task order value of $10,000,000.00 (ten million dollars), whichever occurs first. Work will be issued by negotiated firm fixed-priced task orders not to exceed $500K. The individual task order limit refers to the maximum amount that the contractor is obligated to perform if issued a task order under the contract. Task orders above this amount may be issued provided they are within the overall $5,000,000.00 ceiling of the contract. However, performance of these task orders is not obligatory under the terms of the contract.  The contract is anticipated to be awarded in May 2009.

<DESC>The responses to the above sources sought have been reviewed by the United States Coast Guard and it has been determined that this solicitation will be issued as a small business set aside on or about 16 March 2009. A Pre-Soliciation Notice will be issued prior to the Request for Quote and will be issued under the number HSCG84-09-Q-AAS155. 


The Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Coast Guard, Maintenance and Logistics Command Atlantic, Norfolk, VA and the United States Coast Guard Academy, Leadership Development  Center (LDC), in  New London, Connecticut are seeking interested sources to provide all labor, supervision, transportation, training aids and training materials, except for facilities furnished by the government, for (1) an innovative Instructor Qualification Course (IQC) in leadership and (2) leadership course training materials for IQC trained instructors to use in subsequent LDC courses.  During the first year of this contract, the courses will be taught at the Leadership Development Center (LDC).  In subsequent years, the government may utilize additional locations.  The audience for the IQC will be Coast Guard officers, enlisted, Auxiliary, and civilian personnel currently assigned to the LDC, New London, CT.  Instructors certified through attendance at the IQC will subsequently teach LDC leadership courses and use the training materials purchased under the resultant contract.  The contracted instructors should have as a minimum, an earned master’s degree, however, an earned doctorate is preferred, and a minimum of three years experience in a leadership position.  BACKGROUND:  The LDC is located at the Coast Guard Academy in New London, CT.  The LDC’s Leadership and Quality Institute (LQI) is responsible for teaching and facilitating courses equivalent to civilian adult continuing professional education.  Over 4,000 students are taught each year in the LQI’s Leadership and Management School; one of six major schools within the LDC.  Many of the officer, enlisted, civilian, and Auxiliary members of the Coast Guard will attend training provided by the LDC’s LQI.  Omnipresent issues related to national security require that the Coast Guard’s leadership training be at the highest possible level appropriate to student experience and responsibilities.  It is necessary to approach Coast Guard leadership training in the same way that civilian corporations advance their employees’ leadership skills.  Rarely do successful civilian corporations have the manpower or materials to identify, design, and deliver their own state-of-the-art leadership curricula.  Civilian corporations contract out for sophisticated leadership training.  The Coast Guard cannot afford to purchase leadership training for all its personnel.  The next best option is to obtain a commercially prepared IQC to meet both the instructor-training requirement and the urgent need for quality in leadership training.  The Coast Guard is currently in the process of developing specific requirements for this course.  It is anticipated that this will be a fixed price contract for the majority of the requirements with travel being performed on a cost reimbursement basis.  The Coast Guard envisions the future contractor having an intricate network of resources to provide all aspects of the leadership training course and materials as described.  No solicitation exists for this requirement, therefore DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on FEDBIZOPS.  It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor this site for release of any future solicitation or synopsis.  CONTRACTOR INFORMATION FOR SUBMISSION:  Interested contractors shall describe how they possess the experience and capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the requirements of providing the following:  1. Instructor Qualification Course in Leadership: a. Innovative Methods, b. Hands on Learning, c. Out of Seat Training, d. Problem Solving Methods, e. Student Centered Learning, f. Exercised Focused Training g. Interactive Scenarios and Role Playing.  2.  Instructors: Demonstrate that instructors possess at a minimum an earned master’s degree, however, an earned doctorate is preferred, and a minimum of three years experience in a leadership position is required.  3.  LDC Instructors at the completion of the IQC will be certified to teach the training materials purchased under the resultant contract in LDC leadership classes.  4.  Leadership Course Training Materials: a. describe your course syllabus, course outline or course curriculum to be utilized.  b. Describe how you have prepared reusable instructor visual aids that reinforce the learning objectives in your course curriculum. c. Describe innovative student-training aids that will be effective in helping LDC students remember and implement learning objectives at their job sites. d. Describe student textbooks/workbooks that can be used by students who will be attending the LDC classes taught by the IQC trained instructors.  5.  Provide a project plan timeline or methodology outlining the necessary steps or milestones needed to implement an innovative and effective IQC.  DEMONSTRATION OF THE FOLLOWING IS RECOMMENDED, BUT NOT REQUIRED.  6.  Past experience in providing an instructor qualification course in leadership training for other Government Agencies.  7.  Past experience in providing an instructor qualification course in leadership training for other Universities or Colleges.  8. Past experience in providing an instructor qualification course in leadership training for other Coast Guard Commands.  9.  Past experience in providing an instructor qualification course in leadership training for other organizations.  The above information can be forwarded to the Contract Specialist via e-mail at wendy.j.culbreth@uscg.mil.  Responses should also include the following information:  company name, address, point of contact, phone number; DUNS number, business size to include status ( 8(a), SDB, HUBZONE, SDVOSB, etc), corporate affiliations, potential joint venture partners, teaming partners, or major subcontractors, GSA Contract information if applicable.  All relevant input is encouraged.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited; no basis for claim against the Government shall arise as a result from a response to this Sources Sought or Government use of any information provided.  The Government reserves the right to consider a small business, 8(a) or any other set aside arrangement as deemed appropriate for this procurement.

<AWARDEE>Fitness association of BLS , 2 Massachusetts Ave NE RM G455, washington, DC 20212 US
<DESC>The purpose of this synopsis is to notify industry that a Sole Source Fixed Price Purchase Order will be awarded to the Fitness association of BLS for the base period of March 9, 2009 through March 8, 2010, and 4 one-year option periods, under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(I) and FAR 6.302-1. The Base Year Value is $8,990.00 for 31 total memberships.

The Fitness association of BLS is the only source available within walking distance from the CNN building that will accommodate 30+ persons for a gym membership.  Two other sources with walking distance were reviewed, Care First, whom stated that the onsite gym is only for use by company employees.  The second, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, would not allow for outside attendance from 11am - 1pm daily, a time period that most attendance is at a peak,  Other sources such as Gold’s, Results, and WSC, were all researched and none of those are currently within walking distance. 

For additional information or responses, please contact Shaun Saad, Contract Specialist, at shaun.saad@dhs.gov or 202-344-1971.
