52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items; (PARAGRAPH (D) “DISPUTES”, REPLACE WITH THE FOLLOWING: 52.233-1 Disputes (October 2003) (DEVIATION)

       (a) This contract is not subject to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C.601-613).
       (b) All disputes arising under or relating to this contract shall be resolved under this clause.
       (c) “Claim” as used in this clause, means a written demand or written assertion by one of the contracting parties seeking, as a matter of right, the payment of money in a sum certain, the adjustment or interpretation of contract terms, or other relief arising under or relating to this contract.  However, a written demand or written assertion by the Contractor seeking the payment of money exceeding $100,000 is not a claim until certified.  A voucher, invoice, or other routine request for payment that is not in dispute when submitted is not a claim.  The submission may be converted to a claim by complying with the submission and certification requirements of this clause, if it is disputed either as a liability or amount or is not acted upon in a reasonable time.
       (d)(1) A claim by the Contractor shall be made in writing and, unless otherwise stated in this contract, submitted within 6 years after accrual of the claim to the Contracting Officer for a written decision.  A claim by the Government against the Contractor shall be subject to a written decision by the Contracting Officer.
(2)(i) The Contractor shall provide the certification specified in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this clause when submitting any claim exceeding $100,000.
     (ii) The certification requirement does not apply to issues in controversy that have not been submitted as all or part of a claim.
     (iii) The certification shall state as follows: “I certify that the claim is made in good faith; that the supporting data are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief; that the amount requested accurately reflects the contract adjustment for which the Contractor believes the Government is liable; and that I am duly authorized to certify the claim on behalf of the Contractor”.
(3) The certification may be executed by any person duly authorized to bind the Contractor with respect to the claim.
       (e) For the Contractor claims of $100,000 or less, the Contracting Officer must, if requested in writing by the contractor, render a decision within 60 days of the request.  For contractor-certified claims over $100,000, the Contracting Officer must, within 60 days, decide the claim or notify the Contractor of the date by which the decision will be made.
       (f) The Contracting Officer’s decision shall be final unless the Contractor appeals to the Chief, Procurement Branch, UNICOR, Federal Prison Industries within 90 days of the date of the Contractor’s receipt of the adverse decision.  The decision of the Chief, Procurement Branch on a Contractor’s appeal will be final.
       (g) Within 10 days of the Contractor’s receipt of an adverse Contracting Officer’s decision on a claim, the Contractor may request, and Federal Prison Industries will participate in, non-binding alternative dispute resolution (ADR) by means mutually acceptable to the parties.  Any ADR shall be completed within 60 days of the Contractor’s request, unless the parties agree to a longer period.  A Contractor’s request for, and participation in, ADR will not toll the 90 day time limit within which to appeal an adverse Contracting Officer’s decision to the Chief, Procurement Branch.  
       (h) The Government shall pay interest on the amount found due and unpaid from (1) the date that the Contracting Officer receives the claim (certified, if required); or (2) the date that payment otherwise would be due, if that date is later, until the date of payment. With regard to claims having a defective certification, as defined in FAR 33.201, interest shall be paid from the date that the Contracting Officer initially receives the claim.  Simple interest on claims shall be paid at the rate, fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury, which is applicable to the period during which the Contracting Officer receives the claim and then at the rate applicable for each 6-month period as fixed by the Treasury Secretary during the pendency of the claim.

(a) Upon receipt of a notice of protest (as defined in FAR 33.101) or a determination that a protest is likely (see FAR 33.102(d)), the Contracting Officer may, by written order to the Contractor, direct the Contractor to stop performance of the work called for by this contract. The order shall be specifically identified as a stop-work order issued under this clause.

Upon receipt of the final decision in the protest, the Contracting Officer shall either- (1) Cancel the stop-work order; or (2) Terminate the work covered by the order as provided in the Default, or the Termination for Convenience of the Government, clause of this contract. (b) If a stop-work order issued under this clause is canceled either before or after a final decision in the protest, the Contractor shall resume work. The Contracting Officer shall make an equitable adjustment in the delivery schedule or contract price, or both, and the contract shall be modified, in writing, accordingly, if- (1) The stop-work order results in an increase in the time required for, or in the Contractor's cost properly allocable to, the performance of any part of this contract; and (2) The Contractor asserts its right to an adjustment within 30 days after the end of the period of work stoppage; provided, that if the Contracting Officer decides the facts justify the action, the Contracting Officer may receive and act upon a proposal at any time before final payment under this contract. (c) If a stop-work order is not canceled and the work covered by the order is terminated for the convenience of the Government, the Contracting Officer shall allow reasonable costs resulting from the stop-work order in arriving at the termination settlement. (d) If a stop-work order is not canceled and the work covered by the order is terminated for default, the Contracting Officer shall allow, by equitable adjustment or otherwise, reasonable costs resulting from the stop-work order. (e) The Government's rights to terminate this contract at any time are not affected by action taken under this clause. (f) If, as the result of the Contractor's intentional or negligent misstatement, misrepresentation, or miscertification, a protest related to this contract is sustained, and the Government pays costs, as provided in FAR 33.102(b)(2)  the Government may require the Contractor to reimburse the Government the amount of such costs. In addition to any other remedy available, and pursuant to the requirements of Subpart 32.6, the Government may collect this debt by offsetting the amount against any payment due the Contractor under any contract between the Contractor and the Government.

<SUBJECT>16 -- Install a Doppler Radar System in Gulfstream IV Aircraft
<SOLNBR>EA133M-05-RP-1109
<RESPDATE>050205
<ARCHDATE>05172005
<CONTACT>Linda Stein, Contract Specialist, Phone 757-441-6573, Fax 757-441-3786, Email Linda.C.Stein@noaa.gov - Margaret Rankin, Contracting Officer, Phone 757-441-6562, Fax 757-441-3786, Email margaret.a.rankin@noaa.gov
<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) at MacDill Air Force Base (AFB), FL, has a requirement for a tail-mounted scanning dual-beam X-band research radar system to be used on the NOAA Gulfstream G-IVSP aircraft. NOAA presently anticipates award of a fixed price contract no later than September 2005.  The contract will have a design phase with Preliminary and Critical Design Reviews, followed by a construction and installation phase.  The contract may also require the contractor to use earned value measurement and cost performance monitoring (EVM/CPM).

The Doppler radar system will be used to obtain detailed wind field information for initialization of the National Weather Service (NWS) Hurricane Weather and Research Forecast (HWRF) model.  The Doppler weather radar system shall have the following characteristics:  (1) reflectivity accuracy of ~1dBZ; (2) a radial velocity accuracy of ~1m/s; (3) a vertical resolution of 1 km; (4) a maximum horizontal unambiguous range of at least 50 km; (5) a maximum  rotational rate of at least 10 rpm (60 degrees/sec) to provide target horizontal (along-track) data spacing resolution of no more than 1.5km; (6) a maximum sampled gate length of 150 m; and (7) a total space displacement that permits it to fit within a new tail radome approximately 39 inches in diameter.  The Doppler radar system will interface with a data path and quality control system currently under development by NOAA.  In addition, a Government-provided stepped frequency microwave radiometer (SFMR) must be incorporated into the new tail radome enclosure.  The aircraft is FAA certified and maintains a valid airworthiness certificate.  The installation of the tail radar unit will involve physical modification of the aircraft that will affect its flight characteristics and weight balance.  Such modifications must be accomplished in conformance with the original equipment manufacture’s flight envelope specifications and must comply with FAA certification requirements for the specific aircraft type and mode of operation.  The modified G-IV aircraft is required to comply with Federal Aviation Administration regulations in the Code Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 14, Part 25, 14 CFR Part 36 and 14 CFR Part 91.  The original equipment manufacturer has retained most rights in data for the aircraft.  Performance of this work must be accomplished so as to have as little impact as possible on availability of the G-IV aircraft to perform mandated hurricane, winter storm and other meteorological reconnaissance and research.  Windows of availability of the aircraft for modification and testing exist for 2-3 months in the late Spring and 1-2 months in late Fall of each year.  Delivery of the complete tail radar installation is required not later than July 2007.  This requirement will provide for data collection and characterization by NOAA during the 2007 hurricane season, with full system certification and operational use in the 2008 hurricane season.  NOAA anticipates establishment of a ground mockup system at AOC in order to facilitate Doppler radar system testing and integration with the SFMR and data collection systems.  

In order to ensure that small businesses have a fair opportunity to participate in this acquisition, NOAA will use the Small Business Cascading Evaluation Preference Process.  This cascading set-aside preference provision is included in this Request for Proposals to notify large businesses that, if a sufficient number of eligible small businesses submit highly qualified offers; large businesses may not be considered for award.  The Government reserves the right to make either a full set-aside award or a partial set-aside award depending on the number and acceptability of responses received from small businesses in the evaluation.  The Department of Commerce (DOC) requires that all contractors doing business with Government be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).  Award cannot be made to a company not registered in CCR.  For additional information and to register in CCR, please access the following web site:  www.ccr.gov.  In order to register, all offerors must have a Dun and Bradstreet (D&B) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) identifier.  A DUNS number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun & Bradstreet on-line at www.dnb.com/product/eupdate, or by phone at (800) 333-0505.  The solicitation, notice and all amendments will be posted and available for viewing and downloading on the Government Electronic Posting System (FedBizOpps) site at www.fedbizzzopps.gov. No paper copies will be issued.  No telephone, facsimile or written requests will be accepted.  When the solicitation is posted, it is incumbent upon the interested parties to review this site frequently for any updates/amendments to any and all documents.  The solicitation will be issued on or about April 1, 2004.    Interested businesses are asked to notify the contracting officer that they have downloaded the solicitation via e-mail.

<DESC>The United States Air Force Academy intends to solicit and negotiate a follow-on, competitive indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract for the Department of Defense Medical Examination Review Board (DODMERB) professional medical services.  This contract will be a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract.  The contract provides for professional medical services to accomplish complete medical, audiometric, and optometric “screening” examinations for the United States Service Academies (Air Force, Army, Navy, and Coast Guard, and Merchant Marine), Reserve Officer Training Corps.  (ROTC), and the Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences (USUHS).  Required services shall be performed throughout the United States and its territories.  Therefore the contractor is required to establish/provide multiple examination centers at various locations throughout the country and territories as specified.  The contract is expected to begin 1 Oct 2005 with a 30-day phase-in period (01– 30 September 2005).  The basic period of performance is anticipated to be one year (01 October 2005 – 30 September 2006), with 5 one-year options.  The desired schedule is as follows: solicitation release – 29 MAR 05, proposals due – 06 MAY 05, negotiations complete – 28 JUL 05, award – AUG 05.  Contracted services include, but are not limited to, providing for the professional examinations as listed above, along with personnel management, information technology capable of receiving and sending data electronically to a web based, hypertext protocol secure (https) client server, and the ability to maintain a database of scheduled applicants, and be able to prepare and provide management reports.  The approximate number of examinations required annually for this effort is 20,000 (1,667 per month), and may require as many as 36,000 (3,000 per month).  However, these numbers are only approximate based on historical data, and anticipated future needs, and are not to be considered exact or binding.  

Multiple awards are not being considered.  A source selection will be conducted in accordance with AFFARS 5315.3 at The United States Air Force Academy, CO.

NOTE: Contractors are required to submit standard Representations and Certifications on-line.  A new Federal Integrated Acquisition Environment (IAE) initiative called the ‘Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA)’ is being implemented.  ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the representations and certifications required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations found in solicitations.  However, agency specific provisions and solicitation specific provisions not included in ORCA will still have to be included in solicitations.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 026 (28 FEB 05) - PRV LIBRARY DOCUMENTS  See below documents for Integrated Risk Management Plan (AFMCP 63-101 dated 9  July 1997; and Risk Management Guide, dated June 2003).    PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 025 (28 FEB 05) - Request for Information (RFI) 1.	The Personnel Recovery Vehicle (PRV) is currently required to be  fielded in FY10 with IOC in FY 11.  This schedule includes a 2 year Government flight test program.  For Block 0, the current PRV acquisition strategy has changed to allow a two-year development program.  In order to meet various AFSOC requirements, a Link-16 capability will be required in Block 0. 2.	Provide the following information: a.	Identify if you will be able to develop a Link-16 capability in the  shortened development timespan. b.	Identify what Link-16 hardware would be integrated. c.	Identify if you would be re-using software developed on another  program.  If so, please identify program source. d.	Identify what Link-16 messages you believe is required for PRV and  which messages you would be able to provide in Block 0. e.	Identify Block 10 migration plan to transition your proposed Link-16  implementation to a MIDS-JTRS implementation. f.	What is your assessment of the risk of this effort and your proposed  mitigation plan? g.	Would you be integrating Common Link Integration Processing (CLIP) in  Block 0 for GIG and/or Airborne Network communication?  Explain why or why not. 3.	Provide your response not later than 4:00 PM, EST, 7 Mar 05. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 024 (11 FEB 05) - UPDATED PRV LIBRARY DOCUMENTS The below attached file as of 11 February 2005 is updated to include:  AFI 63- XXX, June 2003, Reformed Supply Support; Mil-HDBK-514, 28 March 2003, DoD HDBK, Operational Safety, Suitability, + Effectiveness for the Aeronautical Enterprise; Mil-HDBK-516A, 5 February 2004, DoD HDBK, Airworthiness Certification Criteria.  PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 023 (11 JAN 05) - SRD RFI extension and  Q+A on SRD RFI SRD RFI as shown in Amendment 20 has extended the deadline for response from 11 Jan 05 to 26 Jan 2005. Clarification on SRD RFI: Question:  Requirements of sections 3.3.7.8, 3.3.9.3.4, 3.3.9.3.5, and 3.3.9.4.1.4 appear to exceed the CDD. We just wanted to confirm the intent, understanding that this is certainly your prerogative. Response:  With respect to 3.3.7.8., the SRD does not necessarily exceed the CDD but rather reflects the use of this capability for night missions and reducing crew workload.  (Ref CDD:  "Night missions and crew workload require the use of artificial aids to enable night operations.  Night operations include the use of Night Vision Imaging System (NVIS) goggles, infrared detection set (IDS), and helmet mounted displays (HMD) or other technologies.")  However, at this point in time we do not know the full extent to which HMDs will be used. Question:  "The PRV attributes needed to support Initial Operational Capability (Block 0) are addressed by Section 3 statements without symbol markings and those that are followed by "T", unless specifically marked as Block 10 (defined as full capability). ..."  This essentially says that anything with no markings or a "T" is a Block 0 requirement, which means nearly everything is a Block 0 requirement.  Is this correct? Response:  Yes, items with no markings or a "T" are Block 0 requirements as stated by the User. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 022 (07 JAN 05) - Request for Information  See below attached file for RFI (MS word document) and CDD-RFI (MS Excel  document). Responses are due NLT 1600 EST, 13 Jan 05.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 021 (14 DEC 04)- Risk/schedule reduction  efforts  The Air Force intends to issue four contracts in support of risk/schedule  reduction efforts in support of the planned competition for the Personnel  Recovery Vehicle (PRV).  These contracts will be issued to the contractors who  have currently expressed interest in proposing for the PRV program.  The goal  of the contracts will be to enable the acceleration of the performance of the  PRV program after award.  The four contracts are planned to be issued to  Northrop Grumman, Bell-Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Sikorsy at an estimated  value of $1.25M each.

Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1)  The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) Warrants; (ii) Options; (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; (iv) Convertible debt instruments; (v) Others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the sam relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the sam relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>Description
Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is seeking sources to provide security screening services to ensure safe, courteous, and efficient passenger and baggage screening at United States airports.  Offerors shall review www.tsa.gov to learn about the background and the acquisition approach associated with this requirement.  To access the SPP information, go to the bottom right heading entitled “Spotlight” and click on the hyperlink directly under “Spotlight” entitled “Screening Partnership Program.”  This page contains links to the acquisition approach, program guidance, Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ’s), and press releases.   The draft Statement of Work is provided on the website for information purposes only. At this time, TSA will be conducting the acquisition process by pre-qualifying offerors to proceed to the next acquisition phase by establishing a Qualified Offeror List (QOL). The following provides a summary of the background and acquisition approach for the SPP:
BACKGROUND
The Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) P.L. 107-71 required the TSA to assume responsibility for passenger and baggage security screening operations at the nation’s airports by November 19, 2002. 49 U.S.C. § 44920 (ATSA §108) provides, in part, that TSA shall allow an airport operator to submit an application to have screening carried out by the screening personnel of a qualified private screening company: 

APPROACH Due to the potential number of airports and private contractors that may be interested in participating in the SPP, and the sensitive nature of the scope of work to be completed, TSA will follow a down-select acquisition approach which is as follows:

1)Develop Qualified Offeror Lists (QOL)(Phase I)
2)Select Offerors determined qualified for Qualified Vendor List (QVL)(Phase II)
3)Issue BOAs to QVL by Region (Phase II)
4)Issue Airport Task Orders Based on Best Value (Phase III)

The first phase is to establish two Qualified Offeror Lists (QOL’s).  One QOL for small businesses and one QOL for large businesses. The QOL’s will pre-qualify offerors seeking to compete for SPP contracts through mandatory GO/NO GO technical and financial requirements.  Offerors must pass statutory ATSA requirements and TSA requirements to be a qualified private screening company. The establishment of the QOL will streamline the acquisition process and allow for TSA to maintain greater control of the contract competition.

After establishing the QOL’s, TSA plans to implement the second phase of the procurement by issuing a Request for Proposals (RFP) to those companies on the QOL.  The result of the RFP will be to award a Basic Ordering Agreements (BOA) to those offerors evaluated to present the required technical and cost capabilities. A BOA is an agreement among parties (not a contract) with no minimum or maximum guarantee. The RFP will include the objectives of the SPP, key selection steps and dates, and information on the criteria and evaluation of the RFP responses. The QVL will establish the qualified offerors by geographical region who can compete for airport specific task orders.  The geographical region will be divided based upon the same regional lines as the TSA Area Directors.  However, Offerors and airport applicants will determine which or all of the geographical areas they would like to be considered for in the QOL/QVL process.  TSA plans to issue task orders for screening services at a particular airport based upon the area in which the airport exists.  Therefore, those offerors and airports on the area QVL for the area in which the airport exists and received a BOA may receive the task order RFP for that airport.   TSA plans to evaluate the small business QOL separately from the large business QOL utilizing the same evaluation criteria. 

The third phase includes those Offerors on the QVL who have been awarded BOAs. These qualified vendors may compete for airport specific task orders on a best value basis.  A BOA is an agreement among parties (not a contract) with no minimum or maximum guarantee.  As such, TSA will issue airport specific Task Orders (TOs) containing specific contract requirements, terms and conditions, tailored to meet the needs of specific airports.

Offerors responding to this combined solicitation/synopsis must submit capability and certification statements.  The capability and certification statements will address the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) mandatory requirements and TSA requirements which are provided in detail on www.tsa.gov.  

The ATSA and TSA requirements will be evaluated on a Go/NoGo basis.  Offerors who DO NOT meet the ATSA requirements identified as Go/No Go criteria WILL NOT be evaluated further on TSA requirements criteria. Only those qualified screening companies that meet the ATSA and TSA requirements will be placed on the QOL and will be determined to have a reasonable chance to be awarded a BOA and be competitively awarded a task order.

The detailed requirements of this synopsis are published on the SPP TSA website at  www.tsa.gov. Offerors shall access and review the SPP website prior to responding.
Proposals are due by 3:00 p.m. Eastern Standard time on November 29, 2004 to the above address to the Attention of Sheila Roche. 

Any questions shall be emailed to OPT-OUT@tsa.gov. Offerors shall state ‘SOLICITATION QUESTION” in subject line of email or else the question may not be answered. The cutoff date for questions is 15 November.

<ARCHDATE>03082006
<CONTACT>Dale Wilkerson Contracting Officer 6626804009     dale_wilkerson@nps.gov;
<DESC>The National Park Service is seeking contractors to remove vegetative fuel accumulations in support of the national Wildland Urban Interface hazardous fuels reduction program on the Natchez Trace Parkway.  The Natchez Trace Parkway is 450-miles long, and runs from Natchez, Mississippi to Nashville, Tennessee.  Over the past several years there has been an accumulation of downed limbs, trees, brush, etc. in many locations along the Parkway.  This material has become "vegetative fuel," capable of feeding wildfires.  Since the Parkway runs adjacent to non-federal lands, both developed and undeveloped, the threat of private property loss should a fire erupt is potentially very great.  Therefore, the purpose of this contract is to mitigate the vegetative fuel accumulation in the identified project areas to lessen the risk of losses due to wildfire, and to remove concentrations of damaged and dead vegetative fuels as a preventative measure.  The contractor(s) will be required to remove all dead and downed woody material and either haul away to an approved disposal site or chip smaller debris.  No standing trees will be cut and stump removal is not a part of this project.  There are four project areas included in this contract and contractors may bid on any or all of the four areas.  Note that multiple awards may result from this solicitation.  Project Area #1 is located near Tupelo Mississippi in Lee county, with approx. 110 acres requiring treatment at an estimated magnitude between $100,000 to $150,000.  Project Area #2 is located near Natchez Mississippi in Adams county, with approx. 36 acres requiring treatment at an estimated magnitude between $50,000 to $100,000.  Project Area #3 is located near Ridgeland Mississippi in Madison county, with approx. 20 acres requiring treatment at an estimated magnitude of $25,000 to $50,000.  Project Area #4 is located near Kosciusko Mississippi in Attala county, with approx. 50 acres requiring treatment at an estimated magnitude between $25,000 to $50,000.  This procurement is a total small business set-aside being conducted as an Invitation for Bids.  The applicable NAICS code is 113310 with an associated size standard of 500 employees. Solicitation package will be available on or about March 23, 2005.  This IFB will be issued electronically on the Department of Interior's National Business Center (NBC) web site, at http://ideasec.nbc.gov.  Paper copies of the solicitation will not be made available.  Bidders desiring to conduct business with DOI are requested to register at the National Business Center.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture intends to award a Sole Source Contract to John Markham for User Training and System Modifications for the NASS Publications Tools Software for Phase II & III.		

1.	OVERVIEW

The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is interested in providing additional user training in their Publications Tools Software, and converting the word processing interface of the Publications Tools Software to use Microsoft Word 2000.  The Publications Tools software is a NASS developed application written in FoxPro, that allows users to extract data from various FoxPro databases created by NASS Estimation System programs.  These data are formatted into tables, and the user can add narrative text and graphics to produce reports for publication as hard copy, as well as electronically on the Internet.  

2.	INTRODUCTION & GOALS

The goals of this project are focused on: providing training to State Office and Headquarters users of the Publications Tools; and conversion of the NASS Publications Tools software to interface with Microsoft Word.

This procurement is the second phase of what NASS anticipates will be a three phase project.  Phase Two is focused on delivery of the training according to the training plan developed and approved in Phase One, as well as programming and testing the software modifications according to the specifications and system design also developed and approved in Phase One. NASS anticipates that Phase Three will provide limited user support for the software modifications made as part of this phase.  

The contractor shall accomplish these goals on schedule within the framework of the NASS Enterprise Architecture, policies, standards and guidelines for processing, systems, and security.  Many of the standards of the NASS Enterprise Architecture are currently being developed.  Detailed requirements for systems specifications and documentation will be discussed with the contractor at the time of the Task One orientation meeting.  

3. 	TASKS

The desired outcomes and performance measures of the first item of this second phase of the project are as follows:

Task #1: Orientation Meeting

Within one week after the contract award, the Contractor shall meet via conference call with the Contracting Officer Representative COR for an orientation meeting, along with other NASS staff and others NASS may invite.  This conference call shall serve to introduce the Contractor to key NASS staff, discuss roles and responsibilities, and review task objectives, reporting, and delivery schedules.

Standard for Task #1: The Orientation Meeting shall be held via conference call within one week of contract award.  The contractor shall prepare an agenda, listing items for discussion, and submit it to the NASS COR via email or fax at least one working day prior to the agreed-upon meeting.  In the meeting, the contractor shall discuss objectives of this phase of the contract and NASS expectations and delivery requirements for the subsequent tasks.


Task #2: Develop On-line Training System for NASS Publications Tools.

The contractor shall prepare multi-media on-line training presentations (for example, using Windows Media Player) which will:
1.	Provide an overview of the Publication Tools System.
2.	Explain the concepts used to determine how the Publication Tools operate.
3.	Demonstrate the functionality of the Publication Tools in detail, to include debugging methods.

The purpose of the on-line training presentation product is to:
1.	Provide assistance to current users of the Publication Tools.
2.	Provide a level of training for those who wish to start using the Publication Tools.
3.	Provide a level of familiarity with the concept and capabilities of the Publication Tools to supervisors and managers.

Standard for Task #2: 
1.	Each presentation should be short-and-simple, covering only one task or item.
2.	Each presentation should be named such that the material covered is obvious.
3.	The presentations should be designed such that they:
	a.	Are easy to prepare.
	b.	Can be updated easily as Publication Tools features are added or changed, or the training for a particular segment needs to be enhanced.
	c.	Make it easy for users to receive training by allowing users to receive Publication Tools training in segments - so that they can end a training segment and pick up where they left-off at a later time.
	d.	Make it easy for users to select a specific training subject - particularly helpful when a user is seeking refresher training for a particular task at hand.
	e.	Can be referenced by the NASS Publication Tools for context-sensitive “show-me-how” help.
4.	NASS users will be able to access the presentations through NASSNet - the NASS intranet home page.

1. 	TASKS

The desired outcomes and performance measures of the second item in this second phase of the project are as follows:

Task #1: Orientation Meeting

Within one week after the contract award, the Contractor shall meet via conference call with the Contracting Officer Representative COR for an orientation meeting, along with other NASS staff and others NASS may invite.  This conference call shall serve to introduce the Contractor to key NASS staff, discuss roles and responsibilities, and review task objectives, reporting, and delivery schedules.

Standard for Task #1: The Orientation Meeting shall be held via conference call within one week of contract award.  The contractor shall prepare an agenda, listing items for discussion, and submit it to the NASS COR via email or fax at least one working day prior to the agreed-upon meeting.  In the meeting, the contractor shall discuss objectives of this phase of the contract and NASS expectations and delivery requirements for the subsequent tasks.


Task #2: Code Programming Modifications to NASS Publications Tools.
The Publication Tools is an application written in FoxPro which relies on WordPerfect to perform the word processing functionality of the tools. Since NASS is adopting Microsoft Word as its Standard-Processing-Technology (SPT) word processor, the code must be modified where it interfaces with the word processor.

Standard for Task #2: 
1.	The following system design and software specifications, approved by NASS, shall be followed to make the required modifications to the Publication Tools System:
	a.	NASS Publication Tools - Conversion of Word Processor System Design
	b.	NASS Publication Tools - Conversion of Word Processor System Specifications

2.	The Publication Tools are currently written in version 6.0 of Microsoft Visual FoxPro. Since this conversion requires modification of the FoxPro code where it interfaces with the word processor, the contractor will upgrade the code to the latest version of Visual FoxPro accepted by NASS.
				
Task #3: Test the converted NASS Publications Tools to ensure that it is functioning according to approved specifications.
The contractor will use a test arena that is isolated from development, maintenance, and production operations.  This test arena will contain reports with tables, documents, and scripts that the contractor will use to test the required functionality for the Publication Tools.  The contractor will maintain all data, documents, and scripts in the test arena.

Standard for Task #3: 
Testing of the converted Publication Tools application will be conducted in three phases (two alpha- and one beta-test phase):
1.	The contractor will test each feature as the code changes are made, using the test case(s) designed for that feature, using the test cases in Appendix A, USDA NASS Publication Tools - Conversion of Word Processor System Design document.
2.	When all code modifications are final, the contractor will execute all test cases and record the results.  This step will be repeated until all tests are passed, or documented as to why the test was not passed (e.g. because of a macro limitation in Word).
3.	Two State Office installations and one in the NASS Headquarters will be used for beta testing the converted application.
4.	After the conversion, the test arena shall be maintained as the benchmark to assure that future modifications are totally backward compatible, and to contain additional cases as needed to provide the benchmark for other operations of the Publication Tools. The documented results from the Word conversion will become the standard for future test comparison.

Task #4: Implement the converted NASS Publications Tools.
After beta testing has shown the converted application to be ready for implementation, a LAN Update will be issued via normal NASS channels to update the Publication Tools in each NASS State Office.

Standard for Task #4: 
1.	The LAN update shall archive the existing application. The Publication Tools Group in Headquarters will update the production environment on the HQ LAN when it is deemed feasible.
2.	There will be a grace period during which the Publication Tools will use either WordPerfect or Microsoft Word.  This will provide the overlap necessary for users to make the transition. 
	a.	During the grace period, the choice to use the WordPerfect version or Word version of the Publication Tools must be available on an individual report basis.
	b.	The decision on when to terminate usage of the WordPerfect version of the Publication Tools will be made by NASS managers.
3.	As specified in the NASS Publication Tools - Conversion of Word Processor System Design, Disaster Recovery section: To mitigate the risk of a major problem with the converted system, options for rolling back to the previous version of the Publication Tools must be in place.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division awarded Contract N00178-98-D-1045 on 14 August 1998 which provides cell phone equipment and related services for a 7-year period of performance beginning 01 October 1998 and ending 30 June 2005.  Further expansion of usage of the contract has resulted in expenditure of contractual ceiling at a greater rate than anticipated.  Therefore, NSWCDD intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, a modification to the existing contract with Cingular Wireless LLC, 7855 Walker Drive, Suite 100, Greenbelt, Maryland 20770-3293 to provide for continued support through the term of the contract, which will end 30 September 2005. At that time, support will be provided through a competitive contract action.  As the incumbent contractor, Cingular Wireless is the sole contractor capable of providing continuity of services through the period leading to a competitive award without major disruption, loss of functionality and/or features, deg! radation of services and significant overall cost impact to the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division.  Vendors who are interested in this procurement must indicate their interest by 14 March 2005.  All responses from responsible sources will be considered.  In addition to cell phone equipment and service plan costs, the evaluation shall consider the impact to switch services, including cost impact coupled with disruption to NSWCDD customers.  Any questions regarding this correspondence should be directed to Code XSD113 at (540) 653-7478 or via email xds11@nswc.navy.mil.  DoD will not longer award contracts to contractors not registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.  Registration may be done by accessing the CCR Web site at http://www.ccr2000.com.  A paper registration form may also be obtained from the DoD Electronic Commerce Information Center at (800) 334-3414.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for the purchase of 300 RTSX-SU series, RTSX32SUCQ208B Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), programmable logic devices, for NASA independent testing.  NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items from Actel Corporation, for the following reasons:  (a) There have been a number of reported and confirmed failures in these devices in both NASA and Department of Defense applications. Actel has developed a new programming algorithm which is believed to mitigate and perhaps eliminate the presence of sensitive outlier devices.  (b) Actel is uniquely qualified for this acquisition, since they are the sole manufacturer of this part, and there are no compatible substitute components available. The Actel components are designed and installed in a large number of NASA spacecraft, and representative samples of Actel devices are required for component level testing.  (c) These components are manufactured by a single vendor, which is Actel, and no qualified alternatives exist. Market research was not conducted, since substitute components are not suitable for an evaluation of NASA flight hardware, which uses Actel parts.  (d) Representative Actel samples must be used for the NASA independent test effort. No other vendor is currently making form, fit, function, and performance compatible substitutes for the SX-S series devices that would yield test results that have significance to NASA missions that have designed in the SX-S series FPGAs.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12 and the Simplified Acquisition Procedures set forth in FAR Part 13-5. The Authority is 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on March 23, 2005. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.  An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for a 9-axis automated ultrasonic immersion test system with Amdata IntraSpect software, installation and training.  The system includes: 1)Windows OS Desktop computer with 2.7GHz or better, DVD RW, 19" display, 256MB RAM or better, 10/100 Network Interface, 56K Modem, Full IntraSpect data acquisition and data analysis software licenses, configured to be compatible one-on-one with existing MSFC 4-axis catamaran scanner manufactured by Wesdyne Amdata; 2) Data Acquisition System (DAS) including one 2-channel UT board, 10/100 network interface, 9-axis motion control, main control enclosure with motor amplifiers; 3) 9-axis 48"x40"x36" immersion tank system, stainless steel tank, water filtration system, 9-axis gantry scanner, associated cabling, configured to be driven by Wesdyne AmData software and compatible with the existing 4-axis scanner.  The acquisition includes installation to working order and training of 3 NASA employees on the use of the system. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase this system from Wesdyne Amdata, 20 International Drive, Windsor, CT 06095.  This recommendation is made pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, which implements the authority for 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) for acquisition of supplies or services from only one source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Competition is impractical for the following reasons: 1.  The automated ultrasonic immersion system being acquired includes equipment and software manufactured by Amdata to perform ultrasonic scanning of material allowables panels, including metals and composites.  It is imperative that this system, which is to be used in the laboratory, be compatible with an existing MSFC 4-axis catamaran scanner manufactured by Wesdyne Amdata, Inc., currently being used in the field to perform phased array scanning of metallic and composite cryotanks and feedlines.  The allowables panels, typically flat panels which are easy to build and test, will be scanned utilizing the system being acquired to determine problems or areas of concern in the panels.	The results of this laboratory scanning identify bad characteristics, such as excess resin, voids, and/or areas which are not uniform.  These findings are then used to infer that characteristics of the process and parameters, etc., which were good in the laboratory setting, utilizing allowables panels, will also be good to scale up the process, if these same conditions and parameters (such as speed and heat) are used again to make the larger component.  These "good" materials are then used in structures such as a cryotank used to hold cryogenic fuel for rockets.  These allowable testing characteristics are then used for comparison with the inspection results in the field, for example of a cryotank made from the same material to determine whether the field item will be passed or rejected and eventually repaired.  Utilizing this comparison and based on their findings, Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) engineers can more accurately assess problems and make recommendations to correct them and/or determine how to avoid these problems in the future.  Without this comparison of data, MSFC NDE engineers can only determine problems in the field but will not have the comparison data to identify the exact problem. 2.  To facilitate this, it is imperative that the software used to inspect the smaller, flat allowables panels be one-to-one compatible with the software used in the field inspection system.  An automated ultrasonic immersion tank acquired from a different vendor could not provide this compatibility because the software from another vendor would not be readable with the field unit due to proprietary formats in the software.  Statistical and feature extractions made on the field unit data results would not be compatible with another vendor's software due to proprietary routines and knowledge of scanning routines.  Considerable engineering design and software development would be required of another company and it is unlikely they would be able to reproduce all of the tank characteristics and software characteristics that have to work together since this would require knowledge of Amdata proprietary data formats, data processing module design, and exact ultrasonic system features.  The results would not be compatible with the data from the field unit and as a result, the fidelity of the field inspection of cryotanks would be severely crippled.  The field inspection would still be able to determine the existence of gross flaws, but the ability to determine the consequence of various levels of damage would not be possible because of the lack of compatibility between the field system and the laboratory system. 3.  Wesdyne Amdata is the manufacturer and they do not sell through distributors. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on March 15, 2005.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), United States Coast Guard (USCG), Telecommunication and Information System Command (TISCOM), Coast Guard Computer Incident Response Team (CGCIRT) has a requirement for custom onsite Intrushield training.  The CGCIRT is responsible for monitoring the Coast Guard’s networks for intrusion detection and security analysis.  Because of these responsibilities CGCIRT requires an Advanced IntruVert Training Course (AIVTC) to ensure all operators of the IntruVert Intrusion Detection & Prevention System (IV-IDPS) are properly trained and proficient with the network monitoring devices used by the Coast Guard.  DHS/USCG has concluded their requirements will best be met through a custom developed course with increased focus on threat analysis and detailed event interpretation. The training course shall be developed and taught in such a way that it will give individuals with a general knowledge of computer network operations a detailed lesson on how to use the IV-IDPS to detect, identify, and investigate network anomalies in an efficient and effective manner.  The IV-IDPS is manufactured and supported by McAfee Inc.  DHS/USCG intends to negotiate with McAfee, Inc. on a sole source basis.  McAfee, Inc creates best-of-breed computer security solutions that prevent intrusions on networks and protect computer systems from the next generation of blended attacks and threats.  Any contractor contemplating this requirement shall be certified by McAfee as qualified to teach the course and the class must be taught with the IV-IDPS specifically in mind.  By developing a comprehensive class on Intrusion Detection and the IV-IDPS, a more efficient pathway to bring CGCIRT personnel to the proper level to become watch qualified on the system is realized.  The class must contain instruction in 1) TCP/IP Communications Model, 2) ICMP Theory, 3) Routing, 4) Microsoft Networking and Security, 5) Intelligence Gathering Tools, 6) Advanced Ethereal.  It is contemplated that award shall be made utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  No telephone inquiries will be honored.

<DESC>TMA E-Commerce Document Capture:  The TRICARE Management Activity (TMA) E-Commerce project is seeking information on all available commercial, off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware/software systems to replace an existing document capture sub-system that is deployed in a centralized environment.  Currently, 2 high speed scanners are processing 50,000 pages per month.  The current document capture sub-system allows users to load paper, native electronic documents, and Exchange server email messages.  The current capture sub-system at TMA is based on a desktop class scanning package.  TMA desires to improve the existing document capture subsystem by:
•	Reducing the resource effort and user interaction required to process, scan, OCR, and load paper documents into Documentum.
•	Improving the OCR accuracy of the scanned images over the current desktop class package currently in use.
•	Improving the system for Quality Control (QC) review of OCR accuracy and correction of errors.
•	Reducing or eliminating the need for manual intervention and work-arounds. (e.g : gray bar reports, documents that are > 1000 pages in length, highlighted text, printed forms, etc).
•	Improving the processing performance without need for additional desktop or server computers.
•	Improving the integration of the document capture subsystem with Documentum EDMS Server.
•	Improving capturing of form text in documents to automatically populate the Documentum document attributes (data fields).
Determination as to the feasibility of solutions submitted by interested vendors will be made by TMA based on the objectives of this request.  The purpose of this announcement is to begin evaluations from an end user perspective into the capabilities and limitations of various products.  Based on the evaluation a performance based Statement of Work (SOW) will be generated and submitted as an unclassified formal Request for Proposal (RFP).  All information received will be treated as public knowledge; therefore vendors should not submit proprietary information in response to this Request For Information (RFI).
Interested parties shall submit an email request for the complete Preliminary Statement of Objectives (PSO) dated 3/4/05 to: dan.poturalski@tma.osd.mil.  This request should be received by TMA not later than 3 pm Mountain Standard Time (MST), March 14, 2005.  An email of the PSO will be forwarded to all interested parties.  All questions regarding the RFI shall be made by email and received by TMA no later than 3 pm MST, March 25, 2005.  Responses shall identify the following RFI number: H94002-05-RFI-0001 and should be received by 3 pm MST, April 01, 2005.  Submissions should include data as identified in the PSO, including contact person, phone number, fax number and email address.  This announcement is for information gathering and planning purposes only and should not be construed as an RFP or solicitation of an offer.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited.

<DESC>The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (Agency) requires a contractor to establish a call center and to provide responses to written correspondence and limited fulfillment functions in an area of the country that would be at least 250 miles from the existing call center located in Cumberland, MD.  This new call center would provide coverage of all calls in the event of a disaster that affects the Cumberland call center operations.  Otherwise, the new call center will handle 50% of daily phone traffic and 100% of the written correspondence.  A key element of the Agency's operating plan is for each of these centers to provide 100% disaster recovery and service interruption relief for the other site.

The Agency intends for this contract to provide a government-owned, contractor operated (GOCO) operation.  That is, the Agency will directly provide for the facility and utilities, computer workstations, custom software applications, required servers, required telephone and data lines, etc.  The contractor will provide the labor required to operate and manage the call center and written correspondence/fulfillment services.  The location of the facility is up to the Offeror, as long as it is at least 250 miles from Cumberland, MD and space is available to be leased by the Agency.  An Offeror may propose space currently operated by the Offeror as a call center if the additional space required for the Agency's operations can be leased separately.  

The Agency is soliciting proposals from qualified firms possessing the background and expertise necessary to provide external call center support and written correspondence handling services.  The Agency requires a supplier that will provide phone coverage (at least 10 hours a day, 5 days a week) while maintaining a superior service level, strong customer service, and accurate, timely reporting.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Offeror s should note that Small Business reserve awards will be selected after the full and open awards have been made with no regard to business size. Therefore, total awards to Small Business Offerors under this acquisition may not be limited to the reserve awa rds. The Government will also include an 18 percent goal of total program dollars for Small Business prime contractors in the award of task orders. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code of 541330, Engineering Services, applies to  this acquisition.

The Technical Data Package (TDP) is restricted to Statement D - authorized for the Department of Defense (DOD) and DOD contractors only, who mus t be registered in the Contractor Central Register (CCR).  When requesting TDP, please provide your Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code and your certification number.  Description of the FMU-143 B/B Fuze System:  The FMU-143 B/B Fuze System is an electromechanical fuze system that provides impact delay detonation for penetrating warheads.  The fuze contains an explosive train, which is mechanically and electrically out-of-line until specific weapon launch cycle events have occurred.  Once a valid l aunch has occurred, the fuze will arm in the selected arm time.  The B/B configuration has a selectable arm time of 5.5 and 12 seconds.  It has a fixed detonation delay after impact of 60 milliseconds.  The fuze is powered by an air-driven turbine generato r power supply called the FZU-32 fuze initiator.  The initiator is non-explosive and has no specific safety requirements.  The FMU-143 Fuze System is comprised of the following elements:  (1) basic fuze with arming and safety pins attached, (2) a fuze aft mounting retainer, (3) a retractile cable assembly, (4) a swivel and clip assembly, and (5) a FZU-32 initiator.  Two each of these five elements are included in each shipping container.  The fuze is housed in an aluminum cylinder (with chem film finish), 8  in. long and 3 in. in diameter.  The fuze is equipped with a safety release assembly (housing and safety release shaft), and a connector to accept operating power.  The fuze has a screwdriver adjustable selector feature to select arming delay times.  The fuze is threaded into the fuze well located at the aft end of the penetrator warhead.  The retractile cable electrically connects the fuze, via an internal warhead conduit, to the FZU-32 initiator installed in the charging well approximately in the middle of the warhead.  The initiator is secured by the aft fuze mounting retainer.  Prior to operational use, the fuze may be stored, transported worldwide, installed in a weapon, loaded on an aircraft, and flown during captive carriage without release.

The website to register for the B-52  Stand-off Jammer Pre-Solicitation Conference to be held at Wright-Patterson  AFB on 16 – 17 Feb 2005 is located at the following address: www.usasymposium.com/b52h B-52H Standoff Jammer The B-52 Systems Squadron, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is preparing to issue a  Request for Proposal (RFP)for a Lead System Integrator for the pre-Systems  Design and Development (pre-SDD) phase of the B-52 Standoff Jammer (SOJ) Program.  This announcement is being posted to provide information about the  program to prospective bidders.  Questions may be submitted to the points of  contact listed at the bottom of this announcement.  We will update this  announcement by posting the questions and our responses in a Bidders Library  that will be placed at the end of this announcement.  This acquisition involves data that are subject to export control laws and  regulations.  It has been determined that foreign companies will not be  permitted to participate in this acquisition at the prime contract level.   Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics  Services Center (DLSC) +http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/+ and have a legitimate  business purpose may participate in this solicitation. Contact the Defense  Logistics Services Center, 74 Washington Avenue N., Battle Creek, Michigan  40917-3084 (1-800-352-3572) for further information on the certification  process. You must submit a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, Military  Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your proposal. REQUIREMENTS DESCRIPTION: We anticipate award of a Pre-System Development and Demonstration (Pre-SDD)  contract in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 for  a Lead System Integrator in the July 2005 timeframe.  This Lead System  Integrator must possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to be Lead  System Integrator of the B-52 SOJ component of the Airborne Electronic Attack  (AEA) System of Systems (SoS) for use by United States Air Force (USAF)  personnel.  The nature of this effort will require access to SECRET or higher  and NOFORN material.   Background The B-52 SOJ will be a core component of the AEA System of Systems.  Other key  AEA components are anticipated to include a jammer variant of the Miniature  Air Launched Decoy (MALD), EC-130H with enhanced jamming pods (Compass Call),  inherent EA capability of Active Electronically Scanned Arrays (AESA) on board  F/A-22s, F-35s, and other AESA-equipped aircraft, the Navy+s EA-6B Improved  Capability III (ICAP III) and EA-18G, and the network/protocols to link these  capabilities.  Some of the key technologies that will be involved include, but  are not limited to: sensitive accurate direction finding Radio Frequency (RF)  receivers, high power relatively broad band directional RF transmitters,  appropriate command and control and on-scene (local) electronic attack (EA)  asset management functions, line-of-sight and beyond line-of-sight networking,  and advanced electronic warfare techniques generation and integration.  A  detailed overview of the B-52 SOJ will be presented at the B-52 Stand-off  Jammer Pre-Solicitation Conference to be held at Wright-Patterson AFB on 16 –  17 Feb 2005.  Additional information for the Pre-Solicitation Conference will  be added to this site as soon as possible.  Further data can be obtained from  the points of contact listed at the bottom of this announcement. Current Environment Concept refinement of the AEA SoS and, in turn, B-52 SOJ, is in process.  An  AEA Analysis of Alternatives was completed in 2001 and forms the basis for  overall AEA capability requirements.  An Initial Capabilities Document (ICD)  for AEA was approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council in Nov 2004.   The B-52H, in its fourth decade of operational service, provides the country  with immediate nuclear and conventional global power projection. There are  presently 93 aircraft in service, operating from two Main Operating Bases  (Minot AFB and Barksdale AFB) with the exception of two stationed at Edwards  AFB for flight testing.  Several modifications are underway or planned for the  B-52H to increase or sustain its capabilities.  A key requirement of the SOJ  is that it shall not degrade any current capabilities on the B-52H.  In  addition, the SOJ design and modification will need to be integrated with  other on-going B-52H modifications.   Contract Descriptions The objective for award of the pre-SDD contract is fourth quarter FY05.   The  approximately 2-year period of performance would include identifying and  evaluating existing technologies and associated suppliers needed to meet SOJ  requirements; reducing the risk or developing a plan for managing the risk  associated with those technologies in SDD; assisting the Air Force in planning  for SDD (including developing spiral development strategies, if applicable)  and accomplishing B-52 SOJ Milestone B (approval for entry into the SDD  phase), and other related tasks.   The Lead System Integrator will be expected to develop and execute a best  value strategy to manage the risks associated with selecting, integrating, and  sustaining SOJ components of varying technological maturity into a cohesive,  scalable/expandable B-52 subsystem.  The Government will require insight into  the integrating contractor’s subcontract and vendor selection process and  decision methodology.  The integrating contractor will be expected to execute,  in partnership with the Air Force, a robust systems engineering process that  includes subcontractors and vendors and to perform all planning necessary to  be able to field and sustain the SOJ capability following its development.   The SOJ capability will complement and shall not degrade the aircraft’s strike  (both nuclear and non-nuclear) capabilities.  Full weapons carriage capability  shall be maintained.  Lastly, it is recognized that because of the B-52  experience and expertise that the Boeing Co. (the B-52 OEM) has built up over  the years, that its involvement will be necessary.  Thus, the Lead System  Integrator will be expected to interface with the Boeing Company or provide a  realistic plan describing how the bidder would accomplish the objectives of  the program without a Boeing interface.

We plan to hold these sessions 29 March  through 1 April at Wright Patterson AFB, Dayton, Ohio.  PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 026 (28 FEB 05) - PRV LIBRARY DOCUMENTS  See below documents for Integrated Risk Management Plan (AFMCP 63-101 dated 9  July 1997; and Risk Management Guide, dated June 2003).    PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 025 (28 FEB 05) - Request for Information  (RFI) 1.	The Personnel Recovery Vehicle (PRV) is currently required to be  fielded in FY10 with IOC in FY 11.  This schedule includes a 2 year Government  flight test program.  For Block 0, the current PRV acquisition strategy has  changed to allow a two-year development program.  In order to meet various  AFSOC requirements, a Link-16 capability will be required in Block 0. 2.	Provide the following information: a.	Identify if you will be able to develop a Link-16 capability in the  shortened development timespan. b.	Identify what Link-16 hardware would be integrated. c.	Identify if you would be re-using software developed on another  program.  If so, please identify program source. d.	Identify what Link-16 messages you believe is required for PRV and  which messages you would be able to provide in Block 0. e.	Identify Block 10 migration plan to transition your proposed Link-16  implementation to a MIDS-JTRS implementation. f.	What is your assessment of the risk of this effort and your proposed  mitigation plan? g.	Would you be integrating Common Link Integration Processing (CLIP) in  Block 0 for GIG and/or Airborne Network communication?  Explain why or why not. 3.	Provide your response not later than 4:00 PM, EST, 7 Mar 05. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 024 (11 FEB 05) - UPDATED PRV LIBRARY  DOCUMENTS The below attached file as of 11 February 2005 is updated to include:  AFI 63- XXX, June 2003, Reformed Supply Support; Mil-HDBK-514, 28 March 2003, DoD HDBK,  Operational Safety, Suitability, + Effectiveness for the Aeronautical  Enterprise; Mil-HDBK-516A, 5 February 2004, DoD HDBK, Airworthiness  Certification Criteria.  PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 023 (11 JAN 05) – SRD RFI extension and  Q+A on SRD RFI  SRD RFI as shown in Amendment 20 has extended the deadline for response from 11  Jan 05 to 26 Jan 2005. Clarification on SRD RFI: Question:  Requirements of sections 3.3.7.8, 3.3.9.3.4, 3.3.9.3.5, and  3.3.9.4.1.4 appear to exceed the CDD. We just wanted to confirm the intent,  understanding that this is certainly your prerogative. Response:  With respect to 3.3.7.8., the SRD does not necessarily exceed the  CDD but rather reflects the use of this capability for night missions and  reducing crew workload.  (Ref CDD:  "Night missions and crew workload require  the use of artificial aids to enable night operations.  Night operations  include the use of Night Vision Imaging System (NVIS) goggles, infrared  detection set (IDS), and helmet mounted displays (HMD) or other  technologies.")  However, at this point in time we do not know the full extent  to which HMDs will be used. Question:  "The PRV attributes needed to support Initial Operational Capability  (Block 0) are addressed by Section 3 statements without symbol markings and  those that are followed by "T", unless specifically marked as Block 10 (defined  as full capability). ..."  This essentially says that anything with no markings  or a "T" is a Block 0 requirement, which means nearly everything is a Block 0  requirement.  Is this correct? Response:  Yes, items with no markings or a "T" are Block 0 requirements as  stated by the User. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 022 (07 JAN 05) - Request for Information  See below attached file for RFI (MS word document) and CDD-RFI (MS Excel  document). Responses are due NLT 1600 EST, 13 Jan 05.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 021 (14 DEC 04)- Risk/schedule reduction  efforts  The Air Force intends to issue four contracts in support of risk/schedule  reduction efforts in support of the planned competition for the Personnel  Recovery Vehicle (PRV).  These contracts will be issued to the contractors who  have currently expressed interest in proposing for the PRV program.  The goal  of the contracts will be to enable the acceleration of the performance of the  PRV program after award.  The four contracts are planned to be issued to  Northrop Grumman, Bell-Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Sikorsy at an estimated  value of $1.25M each.

Highly Classified Information System Support Services

NOTICE TO POTENTIAL OFFERORS:  THE SOLICITATION RELEASE DATE WILL BE DELAYED UNTIL APPROXIMATELY FEBRUARY 18, 2005.  THE START DATE WILL REMAIN THE SAME.  PREVIOUSLY THE NAICS STANDARD HAS BEEN CORRECTED TO $21M, THERE ARE NO OTHER CHANGES TO SYNOPISIS.  QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS FOLLOW.  

QUESTION #1:  Will the statement of work be classified? If so, to what level? If so, will it require the proposal to be classified? Are the end users’ and offices supported by this network strictly USCG?  ANSWER:  THE STATEMENT OF WORK AND THE PROPOSAL WILL BE UNCLASSIFIED.   THE SOLICITIATION WILL INCLUDE THE END USER INFORMATION.

QUESTION #2:  Is the NAICS standard $21M.   ANSWER:  YES, THE NAICS STANDARD IS $21M.

QUESTION #3:  Can you give me an idea of what is the total Level of Effort needed for this work. ANSWER:  THE LEVEL OF EFFORT WILL BE IN THE SOLICITATION.  

QUESTION #4:  Does this mean they have already procured the systems for Anti-Terrorism and are just looking for support services, or are they also looking to purchase these systems still?  ANSWER:  SUPPORT SERVICES ONLY.

QUESTION #5:  The synopsis indicated individuals are required to have TS-SCI to do the work beginning April 1, 2005.  Since this level of clearance is so difficult to obtain, will we be able to start with individuals with this clearance on an interim basis until we can get the necessary clearance for those who will work it on a permanent basis?  ANSWER:  AS STATED IN THE SYNOPSIS, CONTRACTOR MUST ALREADY POSSESS TS/SCI CLEARANCE.

QUESTION #6:  I'm wondering if this is a new requirement or if there is an incumbent contractor.  Also how many people do you anticipate for this requirement?  ANSWER:  THIS IS A FIRST TIME BUY FOR THE U.S. COAST GUARD.  THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WILL BE LEFT UP TO THE CONTRACTOR.

QUESTION #7:  We respectfully request being placed on your bid list and look forward to participating in your bidding process. ANSWER:  THE U.S. COAST GUARD DOES NOT HAVE A ‘BID LIST’.

QUESTION #8:  What is the anticipated staffing level? Is this requirement 24/7 or 8 hours per day 5 days per week?  ANSWER: THIS INFORMATION WILL BE POSTED IN THE SOLICITATION. 

QUESTION #9: Would there be a problem with contractor subbing out some portions of the contract?  Would contractor's "Teaming" with a non Disabled owned firm prevent contract award?  ANSWER:  CONTACT THE SMALL BUSINESS ASSOCIATION TO CONFIRM THAT YOUR BUSINESS ARRANGEMENT WILL QUAILFY UNDER THE SERVICE DISABLED VETERAN OWNED SMALL BUSINESS PROGRAM.

QUESTION #10: I can see that this contract is currently set aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Businesses however I wish to know if you do not obtain sufficient responses from this category if you would be willing to open the contract up to Woman Owned Minority, SDB certified small business?  ANSWER:  ADEQUATE COMPETITION FOR SERVICE DISABLE VETERAN OWNED SMALL BUSINESS HAS ALREADY BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR THIS SOLICITATION.


QUESTION #11:  We would like to have the incumbent's POC's name and phone and email, if possible.  ANSWER:  UNAVAILABLE, AS THIS IS A FIRST TIME BUY FOR THE U.S. COAST GUARD.

PREVIOUSLY POSTED SYNOPSIS FOLLOWS. THE SOLICITATION RELEASE DATE WILL BE DELAYED UNTIL APPROXIMATELY FEBRUARY 18, 2005.  THE START DATE WILL REMAIN THE SAME. PREVIOUSLY THE NAICS STANDARD HAS BEEN CORRECTED TO $21M, THERE ARE NO OTHER CHANGES TO SYNOPISIS.

Please compare your list of planned avionics, communications, instruments,  navigation (including AFCS) components to those provided in the HH-60  Capabilities charts dated 11 Mar 04 (document item number 119 of the PRV  Extended Reference Library) and any other that you forsee which will be  required for your proposed Blk 0 configuration. 2.  What components do you propose to add/replace in your Blk 10 configuration? 3.  For Blk 0, what requirements/capabilities could be moved to Blk 10 in  order to move Blk 0 deliveries up to at least one year earlier (if possible). 4.  What components are you proposing to integrate in order to meet the GIG  requirements? Please provide your answers by 4:00 PM (EST) 26 August 2004. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 016 (17 AUG 04)-RFI Questions-Prime  Contractors 1.  Based upon your previous response to the PRV RFI and the current production  air vehicle that you have used as your PRV baseline, identify all PRV ORD KPPs  and thresholds that this baseline air vehicle (a.) can meet today; and (b.)  will meet by Jan 06. If any KPPs and/or thresholds that cannot be fully met,  identify the capability that can be provided.  2.  Identify which version of your current production you used as your baseline  air vehicle.  Provide your response NLT 19 Aug 04 at 1600 EST. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 015 (5 AUG 04)-Hoist Requirements In response to a question concerning additional hoist requirements, the  Government provides the following response: At this time, we have no additional specification requirements other than the  ORD requirement for a hoist to conduct PRV missions.  Performance requirements  for PRV subsystems, such as the hoist, shall be generated by the Prime  Contractor after a PRV contract award. The PRV System Program Office will not  prepare subsystem requirement documents at any time. It is recommended that potential suppliers of PRV subsystems contact potential  Prime Integration PRV companies for information and integration at the  subsystem level. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 014 (27 Jul 04)-Program Office Estimate The Air Force team is working on a program office estimate (POE) for the  Personnel Recovery Vehicle (PRV).  The POE team is chartered to develop an  estimate by work breakdown structure (WBS) for SDD, production and O+S for a  fleet of 130 aircraft. The team is lead by the Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) cost staff and includes members of the PRV program office. The POE will be  establish as a cost guide for future PRV administrative hurdles including the  source selection process and MS B DAB review.    As a crucial POE building block for PRV presentations to DOD and AF review  boards, we would like to have actual cost from recently completed helicopter  programs as a starting point. We request that each participating RFI contractor  submit actual cost/price info from a recent sale of the proposed helicopter.  This info should justify the WBS level 3 information which you have previously  submitted. We are particularly interested in separating recurring and non- recurring airframe, engines, avionics and mission equipment for the development  and production portions of the program. Production weight of the airframe  should be included. Also, the information should be phased by year and  associated quantities (see below table).   	 	200X	 	200X	 	200X	 	200X  	      N/R    Rec     N/R    Rec	     N/R    Rec	      N/R   Rec Development	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Qty	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Airframe	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Engine 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Avionics	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Mission 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Production	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Qty	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Airframe	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Engine 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Avionics	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Mission 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Since some late summer acquisition briefings (Courses of Action) are requi at the end of the Analysis of Alternatives remain essentially  the same.  Recently, the USAF has decided to evaluate the possibility of  accelerating Initial Operational Capability of the PRV Program.   An Industry Day will be held on a date TBA (March 2004 timeframe) at a location  TBA in the Dayton, Ohio area.  A follow-up announcement specifying the date and  place is forthcoming.  This is an initial opportunity for industry to meet with  cognizant government representatives and discuss the known requirements and  intent of the PRV program.  This Industry Day will also provide industry an  opportunity to comment on the Operational Requirements Document (ORD), to be  provided at a later date, and for industry to express an interest in becoming a  contender in the PRV program.  Contractors will be given an overview of the PRV program.  Contractors will  also be given an opportunity to discuss their understanding of the program and  to present their capabilities/ concepts in general terms during subsequent  meetings with the government.  This is to be considered an initial step in  establishing industry understanding of the PRV program and to allow the  government team to determine market understanding and capability to integrate  and complete the program. This is not a Request for Proposal.  The Government does not intend to award a  contract on the basis of this announcement.  Submitting capabilities and  concepts in response to this announcement is voluntary, and participants shall  not be compensated.  Any organization or company can obtain Personnel Recovery Vehicle announcements  and instructions via the Web at http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil.   Questions regarding technical information and/or this announcement should be  directed to SOF PRV Program office at the following email address:   SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil.   For more information on PRV--Personnel Recovery Vehicles (PRV)- Industry Day please refer to http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil/pixslibr/PRV/PRV.asp. 5. Question  Mr Vokits spoke of the "Technical Descriptions + Challenges."  Could any of those be shared? Answer:  The PIXS PRV website contains a downloadable copy of all the briefings  used at Industry Day, including those on Technical Descriptions + Challenges.   These are related to translating operational requirements into specific  technical understanding of the performance requirements.  The user, the  acquirer, the sustainer and Industry must maintain an active interface and  continual interaction throughout the acquisition and sustainment phases to  ensure there is minimal confusion on requirements interpretation.  This is  especially true when using an evolutionary acquisition approach (today+s  standard DOD approach to weapons systems procurement). 6.  Question:  Milestone dates for RFP, SDD award, first flight, opeval, LRIP,  RAA, FRP? Answer:  No milestone dates have been set.  Programmatics are still being  developed.  A draft schedule leading to contract award was part of the  information provided to industry.  Please refer to ASC PIXS web site as these  dates are developed.   7.  Question:  Structure and details of competitive phase?   Answer:  Programmatics are still being developed.  Please refer to ASC PIXS web  site for updates.   8.  Question:  Specific Block 0 vs. Block 10 capabilities    Answer:  The block approach requirements are still under development.  Please  refer to ASC PIXS web site for updates.   9.  Question:  Concepts for future spirals?   Answer:  Technology insertion and future requirements will be addressed in the  Draft RFP.   10.  Question:  Development and operational test plans? How many test flights  are planned?   Answer:  The details have not been worked out.  The Test + Evaluation Master  Plan (TEMP) has not been drafted but is anticipated on being completed by RFP  release.   11.  Question:  How is the program balancing the risks poised by the aggressive  development timeline?   Answer:  The Air force has a Risk Management Process.   This process will begin  with a Risk Workshop on 23 Mar 04 and will continue throughout the development  acquisition phase.   12.  Question:  From lessons learned in Iraq and Afghanistan, any changes to  requirements for performance, range, onboard capabilities, fleet size?   Answer:  The PRV ORD was developed from requirements derived during the CSAR  AoA. Lessons learned from Afghanistan and Iraq were incorporated during the  draft and coordination process.  They will continue to be analyzed as we write  and coordinate Change 1 to the ORD.  The process to produce Change 1 to  incorporate a Block modification approach has already begun. 13.  Question:  Any participation with navy and marines at this stage in the  program? Answer:  Not at this time.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 009 (12 May 04)-RFI #1 See below attached file for Request For Information #1. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 008 (11 May 04) In response to several inquiries, there are no PRV Industry Days planned at  this time.  A Request For Information (RFI) release is forthcoming via PIXS. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 007 (2 Apr 04)- Risks The Government held a risk workshop for the PRV program on 23-25 Mar 04. There  were over 88 risks identified against a PRV IOC of 2010.  Out of the risks  identified the Government selected those of which had the highest level of  risks and would likely involve industry.  Comments/inputs to these risks would  be beneficial to the Government. 1. Insufficient manufacturing capabilities 2. GFE not available or identified to meet IOC 3. Inability to obtain timely long lead for test and/or production 4. Based on the ORD, inability to incorporate required technology for IOC 5. Training capabilities may not be timely or integrated to support IOC 6. Inability to complete selection/contracting process in time to support IOC 7. Inadequate funding profile to meet IOC 8. Insufficient DT/IOT+E (including live fire testing) planning, resources,  schedule to meet IOC 9. Inability to meet all ORD threshopon  arrival at destination. 3. Question:  What is the projected timeline for the program? Answer:  To accelerate procurement and fielding as much as possible from the  currently planned IOC of 2014 4. Question:  Does the PRV program expect to utilize other platforms, such as    UAVs as part of its organic group of systems? Answer:  The mission area of CSAR is expected to utilize UAV gathered  information to support successful mission execution. 5. Question  Mr Vokits spoke of the "Technical Descriptions + Challenges."  Could any of those be shared? Answer:  The PIXS PRV website contains a downloadable copy of all the briefings  used at Industry Day, including those on Technical Descriptions + Challenges.   These are related to translating operational requirements into specific  technical understanding of the performance requirements.  The user, the  acquirer, the sustainer and Industry must maintain an active interface and  continual interaction throughout the acquisition and sustainment phases to  ensure there is minimal confusion on requirements interpretation.  This is  especially true when using an evolutionary acquisition approach (today+s  standard DOD approach to weapons systems procurement). 6.  Question:  Milestone dates for RFP, SDD award, first flight, opeval, LRIP,  RAA, FRP? Answer:  No milestone dates have been set.  Programmatics are still being  developed.  A draft schedule leading to contract award was part of the  information provided to industry.  Please refer to ASC PIXS web site as these  dates are developed.   7.  Question:  Structure and details of competitive phase?   Answer:  Programmatics are still being developed.  Please refer to ASC PIXS web  site for updates.   8.  Question:  Specific Block 0 vs. Block 10 capabilities    Answer:  The block approach requirements are still under development.  Please  refer to ASC PIXS web site for updates.   9.  Question:  Concepts for future spirals?   Answer:  Technology insertion and future requirements will be addressed in the  Draft RFP.   10.  Question:  Development and operational test plans? How many test flights  are planned?   Answer:  The details have not been worked out.  The Test + Evaluation Master  Plan (TEMP) has not been drafted but is anticipated on being completed by RFP  release.   11.  Question:  How is the program balancing the risks poised by the aggressive  development timeline?   Answer:  The Air force has a Risk Management Process.   This process will begin  with a Risk Workshop on 23 Mar 04 and will continue throughout the development  acquisition phase.   12.  Question:  From lessons learned in Iraq and Afghanistan, any changes to  requirements for performance, range, onboard capabilities, fleet size?   Answer:  The PRV ORD was developed from requirements derived during the CSAR  AoA. Lessons learned from Afghanistan and Iraq were incorporated during the  draft and coordination process.  They will continue to be analyzed as we write  and coordinate Change 1 to the ORD.  The process to produce Change 1 to  incorporate a Block modification approach has already begun. 13.  Question:  Any participation with navy and marines at this stage in the  program? Answer:  Not at this time.

The responsibility  for combat search and rescue was transferred from ACC to Air Force Special  Operations Command (AFSOC) on 1 October 2003.  The operational requirements  developed by ACC at the end of the Analysis of Alternatives remain essentially  the same.  Recently, the USAF has decided to evaluate the possibility of  accelerating Initial Operational Capability of the PRV Program.   An Industry Day will be held on a date TBA (March 2004 timeframe) at a location  TBA in the Dayton, Ohio area.  A follow-up announcement specifying the date and  place is forthcoming.  This is an initial opportunity for industry to meet with  cognizant government representatives and discuss the known requirements and  intent of the PRV program.  This Industry Day will also provide industry an  opportunity to comment on the Operational Requirements Document (ORD), to be  provided at a later date, and for industry to express an interest in becoming a  contender in the PRV program.  Contractors will be given an overview of the PRV program.  Contractors will  also be given an opportunity to discuss their understanding of the program and  to present their capabilities/ concepts in general terms during subsequent  meetings with the government.  This is to be considered an initial step in  establishing industry understanding of the PRV program and to allow the  government team to determine market understanding and capability to integrate  and complete the program.

For more information on PRV--Personnel Recovery Vehicle (PRV) please refer to http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil/pixslibr/PRV/PRV.aspet of helicopters now or in the expected  future that are driving the need for a new platform? Answer:  Current deficiencies are: -Service Life.  The HH-60G is approaching the end of its useful service life. -Survivability.  Insufficient survivability (susceptibility and vulnerability)  to ensure mission success against the Defense Planning Guidance (DPG) validated  threat environment. This includes a limited electronic warfare suite,  insufficient defensive armament for suppression of air and ground threats, and  inadequate protection from small arms fire -Range / Combat radius. Aircraft and rotor system design limit unrefueled  combat radius.  In certain theaters, these characteristics do not meet  Combatant Commanders mission requirements for mission execution. -Payload capacity / Cabin volume. Extremely limited cabin space for stowage and  employment of mission equipment and crew served weapons, infiltration of  Recovery Teams, exfiltration of Recovery Teams and isolated personnel, and  medical treatment of isolated personnel. -Battlespace awareness.  Lack of line-of-sight (LOS) and BLOS high speed LPE  data links for battle space/situational awareness of isolated personnel’s  location, threat information, and location of friendly forces. -Mission react time. Deployment shortfalls that prevent current combat rescue  forces from being mission ready upon commencement of hostilities – the most  likely time for losses.  -Adverse weather capability.  Lack of adverse weather penetration system(s) to  perform PR missions in a combat environment. ACC conducted an AoA to evaluate potential solutions to current validated  deficiencies. A new medium-lift helicopter was recommended as the most cost- effective solution to replace the aging HH-60G. This recommendation was briefed  to and approved by the AFROC in June 01. 2. Question:  Could you describe the KPPs as they exist for the program now? Answer:   •The PRV with a full, standard configuration load (SCL) must have a straight- line unrefueled combat mission radius of 325 nautical miles (nm). •The downwash in and around the recovery vehicle produced by the PRV during Hot  Day tactical hover operations in all environments (to include heavily forested,  steep mountainous, smooth-level, rough-level, smooth-sloped, and rough-sloped  terrain in calm and high crosswind conditions with loose particles such as tree  limbs, sand, water or rocks in the hover zone) at mid-mission gross weights  with SCL in Appendix C must not prevent recovery team or injured and uninjured  isolated personnel safe operations (hover extraction operations (hoist),  providing emergency lifesaving measures to isolated personnel, placement of a  non-ambulatory personnel in a hoist recovery device, overland movement, self- protection, communication, and swimming). •The PRV must satisfy 100% of top level information exchange requirements (IER)  designated as critical.  Satisfaction is defined as sender/receiver must be  able to execute the required function/mission task without operator  intervention.  (Interoperability KPP).   •To support Air and Space Expeditionary Force (ASEF) tasking requiring little  or no warning, mission ready PRV aircraft, weapons, and support equipment must  be capable of worldwide self-deployment (4000 nm) and mission ready within 24  hours of notification or configurable to fit within existing transport aircraft  (USAF AMC C-5 and C-17 transport aircraft) within 3 hours of initial  notification and capable of being made mission ready within 3 hours upon  arrival at destination. 3.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE (Initial) (29 Jan 04) The Special Operations Forces-Combat Search and Rescue Systems Program Office  at Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) is starting up a new program to develop  and procure 132 Personnel Recovery Vehicles (PRV).  This effort is follow-on to  the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) completed by Air Combat Command (ACC) in  2001 which recommend replacing 104 HH-60G light helicopters with 132 medium- lift helicopters for the combat search and rescue mission.  The responsibility  for combat search and rescue was transferred from ACC to Air Force Special  Operations Command (AFSOC) on 1 October 2003.  The operational requirements  developed by ACC at the end of the Analysis of Alternatives remain essentially  the same.  Recently, the USAF has decided to evaluate the possibility of  accelerating Initial Operational Capability of the PRV Program.   An Industry Day will be held on a date TBA (March 2004 timeframe) at a location  TBA in the Dayton, Ohio area.  A follow-up announcement specifying the date and  place is forthcoming.  This is an initial opportunity for industry to meet with  cognizant government representatives and discuss the known requirements and  intent of the PRV program.  This Industry Day will also provide industry an  opportunity to comment on the Operational Requirements Document (ORD), to be  provided at a later date, and for industry to express an interest in becoming a  contender in the PRV program.  Contractors will be given an overview of the PRV program.  Contractors will  also be given an opportunity to discuss their understanding of the program and  to present their capabilities/ concepts in general terms during subsequent  meetings with the government.  This is to be considered an initial step in  establishing industry understanding of the PRV program and to allow the  government team to determine market understanding and capability to integrate  and complete the program. This is not a Request for Proposal.  The Government does not intend to award a  contract on the basis of this announcement.  Submitting capabilities and  concepts in response to this announcement is voluntary, and participants shall  not be compensated.  Any organization or company can obtain Personnel Recovery Vehicle announcements  and instructions via the Web at http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil.

<DESC>PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE (09 DEC 04) – Archived solicitation/synopsis information See below attached file for archived PIXS soliciation synopsis information  (initial through Amendment 20). For more information on PRV--Personnel Recovery Vehicle (PRV) please refer to http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil/pixslibr/PRV/PRV.aspthe ASC/LUH at the 4 March Industry Day, Lockheed Team 101  plans to brief the SPO on 13 April at 10:00 for about 1 hour. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 004 (19 Mar 04)- Questions and Answers The following questions were submitted to the government.  All questions and  answers have been cleared through the Public Affairs office. 1.  Question:  Could you give a brief description of the areas that are not  currently met by the existing fleet of helicopters now or in the expected  future that are driving the need for a new platform? Answer:  Current deficiencies are: -Service Life.  The HH-60G is approaching the end of its useful service life. -Survivability.  Insufficient survivability (susceptibility and vulnerability)  to ensure mission success against the Defense Planning Guidance (DPG) validated  threat environment. This includes a limited electronic warfare suite,  insufficient defensive armament for suppression of air and ground threats, and  inadequate protection from small arms fire -Range / Combat radius. Aircraft and rotor system design limit unrefueled  combat radius.  In certain theaters, these characteristics do not meet  Combatant Commanders mission requirements for mission execution. -Payload capacity / Cabin volume. Extremely limited cabin space for stowage and  employment of mission equipment and crew served weapons, infiltration of  Recovery Teams, exfiltration of Recovery Teams and isolated personnel, and  medical treatment of isolated personnel. -Battlespace awareness.  Lack of line-of-sight (LOS) and BLOS high speed LPE  data links for battle space/situational awareness of isolated personnel’s  location, threat information, and location of friendly forces. -Mission react time. Deployment shortfalls that prevent current combat rescue  forces from being mission ready upon commencement of hostilities – the most  likely time for losses.  -Adverse weather capability.  Lack of adverse weather penetration system(s) to  perform PR missions in a combat environment. ACC conducted an AoA to evaluate potential solutions to current validated  deficiencies. A new medium-lift helicopter was recommended as the most cost- effective solution to replace the aging HH-60G. This recommendation was briefed  to and approved by the AFROC in June 01. 2. Question:  Could you describe the KPPs as they exist for the program now? Answer:   •The PRV with a full, standard configuration load (SCL) must have a straight- line unrefueled combat mission radius of 325 nautical miles (nm). •The downwash in and around the recovery vehicle produced by the PRV during Hot  Day tactical hover operations in all environments (to include heavily forested,  steep mountainous, smooth-level, rough-level, smooth-sloped, and rough-sloped  terrain in calm and high crosswind conditions with loose particles such as tree  limbs, sand, water or rocks in the hover zone) at mid-mission gross weights  with SCL in Appendix C must not prevent recovery team or injured and uninjured  isolated personnel safe operations (hover extraction operations (hoist),  providing emergency lifesaving measures to isolated personnel, placement of a  non-ambulatory personnel in a hoist recovery device, overland movement, self- protection, communication, and swimming). •The PRV must satisfy 100% of top level information exchange requirements (IER)  designated as critical.  Satisfaction is defined as sender/receiver must be  able to execute the required function/mission task without operator  intervention.  (Interoperability KPP).   •To support Air and Space Expeditionary Force (ASEF) tasking requiring little  or no warning, mission ready PRV aircraft, weapons, and support equipment must  be capable of worldwide self-deployment (4000 nm) and mission ready within 24  hours of notification or configurable to fit within existing transport aircraft  (USAF AMC C-5 and C-17 transport aircraft) within 3 hours of initial  notification and capable of being made mission ready within 3 hours uof notification or configurable to fit within existing transport aircraft  (USAF AMC C-5 and C-17 transport aircraft) within 3 hours of initial  notification and capable of being made mission ready within 3 hours upon  arrival at destination. 3. Question:  What is the projected timeline for the program? Answer:  To accelerate procurement and fielding as much as possible from the  currently planned IOC of 2014 4. Question:  Does the PRV program expect to utilize other platforms, such as    UAVs as part of its organic group of systems? Answer:  The mission area of CSAR is expected to utilize UAV gathered  information to support successful mission execution. 5. Question  Mr Vokits spoke of the "Technical Descriptions + Challenges."  Could any of those be shared? Answer:  The PIXS PRV website contains a downloadable copy of all the briefings  used at Industry Day, including those on Technical Descriptions + Challenges.   These are related to translating operational requirements into specific  technical understanding of the performance requirements.  The user, the  acquirer, the sustainer and Industry must maintain an active interface and  continual interaction throughout the acquisition and sustainment phases to  ensure there is minimal confusion on requirements interpretation.  This is  especially true when using an evolutionary acquisition approach (today+s  standard DOD approach to weapons systems procurement). 6.  Question:  Milestone dates for RFP, SDD award, first flight, opeval, LRIP,  RAA, FRP? Answer:  No milestone dates have been set.  Programmatics are still being  developed.  A draft schedule leading to contract award was part of the  information provided to industry.  Please refer to ASC PIXS web site as these  dates are developed.   7.  Question:  Structure and details of competitive phase?   Answer:  Programmatics are still being developed.  Please refer to ASC PIXS web  site for updates.   8.  Question:  Specific Block 0 vs. Block 10 capabilities    Answer:  The block approach requirements are still under development.  Please  refer to ASC PIXS web site for updates.   9.  Question:  Concepts for future spirals?   Answer:  Technology insertion and future requirements will be addressed in the  Draft RFP.   10.  Question:  Development and operational test plans? How many test flights  are planned?   Answer:  The details have not been worked out.  The Test + Evaluation Master  Plan (TEMP) has not been drafted but is anticipated on being completed by RFP  release.   11.  Question:  How is the program balancing the risks poised by the aggressive  development timeline?   Answer:  The Air force has a Risk Management Process.   This process will begin  with a Risk Workshop on 23 Mar 04 and will continue throughout the development  acquisition phase.   12.  Question:  From lessons learned in Iraq and Afghanistan, any changes to  requirements for performance, range, onboard capabilities, fleet size?   Answer:  The PRV ORD was developed from requirements derived during the CSAR  AoA. Lessons learned from Afghanistan and Iraq were incorporated during the  draft and coordination process.  They will continue to be analyzed as we write  and coordinate Change 1 to the ORD.  The process to produce Change 1 to  incorporate a Block modification approach has already begun. 13.  Question:  Any participation with navy and marines at this stage in the  program? Answer:  Not at this time.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE (Initial) (29 Jan 04) The Special Operations Forces-Combat Search and Rescue Systems Program Office  at Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) is starting up a new program to develop  and procure 132 Personnel Recovery Vehicles (PRV).  This effort is follow-on to  the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) completed by Air Combat Command (ACC) in  2001 which recommend replacing 104 HH-60G light helicopters with 132 medium- lift helicopters for the combat search and rescue mission.  The responsibility  for combat search and rescue was transferred from ACC to Air Force Special  Operations Command (AFSOC) on 1 October 2003.  The operational requirements  developed by ACC at the end of the Analysis of Alternatives remain essentially  the same.  Recently, the USAF has decided to evaluate the possibility of  accelerating Initial Operational Capability of the PRV Program.   An Industry Day will be held on a date TBA (March 2004 timeframe) at a location  TBA in the Dayton, Ohio area.  A follow-up announcement specifying the date and  place is forthcoming.  This is an initial opportunity for industry to meet with  cognizant government representatives and discuss the known requirements and  intent of the PRV program.  This Industry Day will also provide industry an  opportunity to comment on the Operational Requirements Document (ORD), to be  provided at a later date, and for industry to express an interest in becoming a  contender in the PRV program.  Contractors will be given an overview of the PRV program.  Contractors will  also be given an opportunity to discuss their understanding of the program and  to present their capabilities/ concepts in general terms during subsequent  meetings with the government.  This is to be considered an initial step in  establishing industry understanding of the PRV program and to allow the  government team to determine market understanding and capability to integrate  and complete the program. This is not a Request for Proposal.  The Government does not intend to award a  contract on the basis of this announcement.  Submitting capabilities and  concepts in response to this announcement is voluntary, and participants shall  not be compensated.  Any organization or company can obtain Personnel Recovery Vehicle announcements  and instructions via the Web at http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil.   Questions regarding technical information and/or this announcement should be  directed to SOF PRV Program office at the following email address:   SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 006 (31 Mar 04)- Sikorsky Briefing In response to questions during the one-on-on sessions between Prime  Contractors and the ASC/LUH at the 4 March Industry Day, Sikorsky plans to  brief the SPO on 14 April at 15:00 for about 1hour. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 005 (22 Mar 04)- Team 101 Briefing In response to questions during the one-on-on sessions between Prime  Contractors and the ASC/LUH at the 4 March Industry Day, Lockheed Team 101  plans to brief the SPO on 13 April at 10:00 for about 1 hour. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 004 (19 Mar 04)- Questions and Answers The following questions were submitted to the government.  All questions and  answers have been cleared through the Public Affairs office. 1.  Question:  Could you give a brief description of the areas that are not  currently met by the existing fleet of helicopters now or in the expected  future that are driving the need for a new platform? Answer:  Current deficiencies are: -Service Life.  The HH-60G is approaching the end of its useful service life. -Survivability.  Insufficient survivability (susceptibility and vulnerability)  to ensure mission success against theent and fielding as much as possible from the  currently planned IOC of 2014 4. Question:  Does the PRV program expect to utilize other platforms, such as    UAVs as part of its organic group of systems? Answer:  The mission area of CSAR is expected to utilize UAV gathered  information to support successful mission execution. 5. Question  Mr Vokits spoke of the "Technical Descriptions + Challenges."  Could any of those be shared? Answer:  The PIXS PRV website contains a downloadable copy of all the briefings  used at Industry Day, including those on Technical Descriptions + Challenges.   These are related to translating operational requirements into specific  technical understanding of the performance requirements.  The user, the  acquirer, the sustainer and Industry must maintain an active interface and  continual interaction throughout the acquisition and sustainment phases to  ensure there is minimal confusion on requirements interpretation.  This is  especially true when using an evolutionary acquisition approach (today+s  standard DOD approach to weapons systems procurement). 6.  Question:  Milestone dates for RFP, SDD award, first flight, opeval, LRIP,  RAA, FRP? Answer:  No milestone dates have been set.  Programmatics are still being  developed.  A draft schedule leading to contract award was part of the  information provided to industry.  Please refer to ASC PIXS web site as these  dates are developed.   7.  Question:  Structure and details of competitive phase?   Answer:  Programmatics are still being developed.  Please refer to ASC PIXS web  site for updates.   8.  Question:  Specific Block 0 vs. Block 10 capabilities    Answer:  The block approach requirements are still under development.  Please  refer to ASC PIXS web site for updates.   9.  Question:  Concepts for future spirals?   Answer:  Technology insertion and future requirements will be addressed in the  Draft RFP.   10.  Question:  Development and operational test plans? How many test flights  are planned?   Answer:  The details have not been worked out.  The Test + Evaluation Master  Plan (TEMP) has not been drafted but is anticipated on being completed by RFP  release.   11.  Question:  How is the program balancing the risks poised by the aggressive  development timeline?   Answer:  The Air force has a Risk Management Process.   This process will begin  with a Risk Workshop on 23 Mar 04 and will continue throughout the development  acquisition phase.   12.  Question:  From lessons learned in Iraq and Afghanistan, any changes to  requirements for performance, range, onboard capabilities, fleet size?   Answer:  The PRV ORD was developed from requirements derived during the CSAR  AoA. Lessons learned from Afghanistan and Iraq were incorporated during the  draft and coordination process.  They will continue to be analyzed as we write  and coordinate Change 1 to the ORD.  The process to produce Change 1 to  incorporate a Block modification approach has already begun. 13.  Question:  Any participation with navy and marines at this stage in the  program? Answer:  Not at this time.

Document requests will be forwarded to the originator by  ASC/LU Security Office.  You should expect a delay in the receipt of the  requested document if prior approval is required. NOTE 2:  Foreign Nationals:  Visit Notifications must be requested through the  appropriate embassy for visit approval. Please direct all requests and questions concerning classified documents to: Ms. Denise D. Quick Chief, ASC/LU Security 937-255-4713 1895 5tly met by the existing fleet of helicopters now or in the expected  future that are driving the need for a new platform? Answer:  Current deficiencies are: -Service Life.  The HH-60G is approaching the end of its useful service life. -Survivability.  Insufficient survivability (susceptibility and vulnerability)  to ensure mission success against the Defense Planning Guidance (DPG) validated  threat environment. This includes a limited electronic warfare suite,  insufficient defensive armament for suppression of air and ground threats, and  inadequate protection from small arms fire -Range / Combat radius. Aircraft and rotor system design limit unrefueled  combat radius.  In certain theaters, these characteristics do not meet  Combatant Commanders mission requirements for mission execution. -Payload capacity / Cabin volume. Extremely limited cabin space for stowage and  employment of mission equipment and crew served weapons, infiltration of  Recovery Teams, exfiltration of Recovery Teams and isolated personnel, and  medical treatment of isolated personnel. -Battlespace awareness.  Lack of line-of-sight (LOS) and BLOS high speed LPE  data links for battle space/situational awareness of isolated personnel’s  location, threat information, and location of friendly forces. -Mission react time. Deployment shortfalls that prevent current combat rescue  forces from being mission ready upon commencement of hostilities – the most  likely time for losses.  -Adverse weather capability.  Lack of adverse weather penetration system(s) to  perform PR missions in a combat environment. ACC conducted an AoA to evaluate potential solutions to current validated  deficiencies. A new medium-lift helicopter was recommended as the most cost- effective solution to replace the aging HH-60G. This recommendation was briefed  to and approved by the AFROC in June 01. 2. Question:  Could you describe the KPPs as they exist for the program now? Answer:   •The PRV with a full, standard configuration load (SCL) must have a straight- line unrefueled combat mission radius of 325 nautical miles (nm). •The downwash in and around the recovery vehicle produced by the PRV during Hot  Day tactical hover operations in all environments (to include heavily forested,  steep mountainous, smooth-level, rough-level, smooth-sloped, and rough-sloped  terrain in calm and high crosswind conditions with loose particles such as tree  limbs, sand, water or rocks in the hover zone) at mid-mission gross weights  with SCL in Appendix C must not prevent recovery team or injured and uninjured  isolated personnel safe operations (hover extraction operations (hoist),  providing emergency lifesaving measures to isolated personnel, placement of a  non-ambulatory personnel in a hoist recovery device, overland movement, self- protection, communication, and swimming). •The PRV must satisfy 100% of top level information exchange requirements (IER)  designated as critical.  Satisfaction is defined as sender/receiver must be  able to execute the required function/mission task without operator  intervention.  (Interoperability KPP).   •To support Air and Space Expeditionary Force (ASEF) tasking requiring little  or no warning, mission ready PRV aircraft, weapons, and support equipment must  be capable of worldwide self-deployment (4000 nm) and mission ready within 24  hours of notification or configurable to fit within existing transport aircraft  (USAF AMC C-5 and C-17 transport aircraft) within 3 hours of initial  notification and capable of being made mission ready within 3 hours upon  arrival at destination. 3. Question:  What is the projected timeline for the program? Answer:  To accelerate procurement and fielding as much as possible from the  currently planned IOC of 2014 4.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE (Initial) (29 Jan 04) The Special Operations Forces-Combat Search and Rescue Systems Program Office  at Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) is starting up a new program to develop  and procure 132 Personnel Recovery Vehicles (PRV).  This effort is follow-on to  the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) completed by Air Combat Command (ACC) in  2001 which recommend replacing 104 HH-60G light helicopters with 132 medium- lift helicopters for the combat search and rescue mission.  The responsibility  for combat search and rescue was transferred from ACC to Air Force Special  Operations Command (AFSOC) on 1 October 2003.  The operational requirements  developed by ACC at the end of the Analysis of Alternatives ren the Dayton, Ohio area.  A follow-up announcement specifying the date and  place is forthcoming.  This is an initial opportunity for industry to meet with  cognizant government representatives and discuss the known requirements and  intent of the PRV program.  This Industry Day will also provide industry an  opportunity to comment on the Operational Requirements Document (ORD), to be  provided at a later date, and for industry to express an interest in becoming a  contender in the PRV program.  Contractors will be given an overview of the PRV program.  Contractors will  also be given an opportunity to discuss their understanding of the program and  to present their capabilities/ concepts in general terms during subsequent  meetings with the government.  This is to be considered an initial step in  establishing industry understanding of the PRV program and to allow the  government team to determine market understanding and capability to integrate  and complete the program. This is not a Request for Proposal.  The Government does not intend to award a  contract on the basis of this announcement.  Submitting capabilities and  concepts in response to this announcement is voluntary, and participants shall  not be compensated.  Any organization or company can obtain Personnel Recovery Vehicle announcements  and instructions via the Web at http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil.   Questions regarding technical information and/or this announcement should be  directed to SOF PRV Program office at the following email address:   SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil.

Please compare your list of planned avionics, communications, instruments,  navigation (including AFCS) components to those provided in the HH-60  Capabilities charts dated 11 Mar 04 (document item number 119 of the PRV  Extended Reference Library) and any other that you forsee which will be  required for your proposed Blk 0 configuration.  Information provided should  show that the capabilities of the current rescue vehicle are preserved or  enhanced in the block 0 configuration.  2.  What components do you propose to add/replace in your Blk 10 configuration? 3.  For Blk 0, what requirements/capabilities could be moved to Blk 10 in  order to move Blk 0 deliveries up to at least one year earlier (if possible). 4.  What components are you proposing to integrate in order to meet the GIG  requirements? Please provide your answers by 4:00 PM (EST) 26 August 2004. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 016 (17 AUG 04)-RFI Questions-Prime  Contractors 1.  Based upon your previous response to the PRV RFI and the current production  air vehicle that you have used as your PRV baseline, identify all PRV ORD KPPs  and thresholds that this baseline air vehicle (a.) can meet today; and (b.)  will meet by Jan 06. If any KPPs and/or thresholds that cannot be fully met,  identify the capability that can be provided.  2.  Identify which version of your current production you used as your baseline  air vehicle.  Provide your response NLT 19 Aug 04 at 1600 EST. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 015 (5 AUG 04)-Hoist Requirements In response to a question concerning additional hoist requirements, the  Government provides the following response: At this time, we have no additional specification requirements other than the  ORD requirement for a hoist to conduct PRV missions.  Performance requirements  for PRV subsystems, such as the hoist, shall be generated by the Prime  Contractor after a PRV contract award. The PRV System Program Office will not  prepare subsystem requirement documents at any time. It is recommended that potential suppliers of PRV subsystems contact potential  Prime Integration PRV companies for information and integration at the  subsystem level. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 014 (27 Jul 04)-Program Office Estimate The Air Force team is working on a program office estimate (POE) for the  Personnel Recovery Vehicle (PRV).  The POE team is chartered to develop an  estimate by work breakdown structure (WBS) for SDD, production and O+S for a  fleet of 130 aircraft. The team is lead by the Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) cost staff and includes members of the PRV program office. The POE will be  establish as a cost guide for future PRV administrative hurdles including the  source selection process and MS B DAB review.    As a crucial POE building block for PRV presentations to DOD and AF review  boards, we would like to have actual cost from recently completed helicopter  programs as a starting point. We request that each participating RFI contractor  submit actual cost/price info from a recent sale of the proposed helicopter.  This info should justify the WBS level 3 information which you have previously  submitted. We are particularly interested in separating recurring and non- recurring airframe, engines, avionics and mission equipment for the development  and production portions of the program. Production weight of the airframe  should be included. Also, the information should be phased by year and  associated quantities (see below table).   	 	200X	 	200X	 	200X	 	200X  	      N/R    Rec     N/R    Rec	     N/R    Rec	      N/R   Rec Development	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Qty	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Airframe	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Engine 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Avionics	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Mission 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Production	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Qty	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Airframe	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Engin general terms during subsequent  meetings with the government.  This is to be considered an initial step in  establishing industry understanding of the PRV program and to allow the  government team to determine market understanding and capability to integrate  and complete the program. This is not a Request for Proposal.  The Government does not intend to award a  contract on the basis of this announcement.  Submitting capabilities and  concepts in response to this announcement is voluntary, and participants shall  not be compensated.  Any organization or company can obtain Personnel Recovery Vehicle announcements  and instructions via the Web at http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil.   Questions regarding technical information and/or this announcement should be  directed to SOF PRV Program office at the following email address:   SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil.   For more information on PRV--Personnel Recovery Vehicles (PRV)- Industry Day please refer to http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil/pixslibr/PRV/PRV.asp. 5. Question  Mr Vokits spoke of the "Technical Descriptions + Challenges."  Could any of those be shared? Answer:  The PIXS PRV website contains a downloadable copy of all the briefings  used at Industry Day, including those on Technical Descriptions + Challenges.   These are related to translating operational requirements into specific  technical understanding of the performance requirements.  The user, the  acquirer, the sustainer and Industry must maintain an active interface and  continual interaction throughout the acquisition and sustainment phases to  ensure there is minimal confusion on requirements interpretation.  This is  especially true when using an evolutionary acquisition approach (today+s  standard DOD approach to weapons systems procurement). 6.  Question:  Milestone dates for RFP, SDD award, first flight, opeval, LRIP,  RAA, FRP? Answer:  No milestone dates have been set.  Programmatics are still being  developed.  A draft schedule leading to contract award was part of the  information provided to industry.  Please refer to ASC PIXS web site as these  dates are developed.   7.  Question:  Structure and details of competitive phase?   Answer:  Programmatics are still being developed.  Please refer to ASC PIXS web  site for updates.   8.  Question:  Specific Block 0 vs. Block 10 capabilities    Answer:  The block approach requirements are still under development.  Please  refer to ASC PIXS web site for updates.   9.  Question:  Concepts for future spirals?   Answer:  Technology insertion and future requirements will be addressed in the  Draft RFP.   10.  Question:  Development and operational test plans? How many test flights  are planned?   Answer:  The details have not been worked out.  The Test + Evaluation Master  Plan (TEMP) has not been drafted but is anticipated on being completed by RFP  release.   11.  Question:  How is the program balancing the risks poised by the aggressive  development timeline?   Answer:  The Air force has a Risk Management Process.   This process will begin  with a Risk Workshop on 23 Mar 04 and will continue throughout the development  acquisition phase.   12.  Question:  From lessons learned in Iraq and Afghanistan, any changes to  requirements for performance, range, onboard capabilities, fleet size?   Answer:  The PRV ORD was developed from requirements derived during the CSAR  AoA. Lessons learned from Afghanistan and Iraq were incorporated during the  draft and coordination process.  They will continue to be analyzed as we write  and coordinate Change 1 to the ORD.  The process to produce Change 1 to  incorporate a Block modification approach has already begun. 13.  Question:  Any participation with navy and marines at this stage in the  program? Answer:  Not at this time.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 004 (19 Mar 04)- Questions and Answers The following questions were submitted to the government.  All questions and  answers have been cleared through the Public Affairs office. 1.  Question:  Could you give a brief description of the areas that are not  currently met by the existing fleet of helicopters now or in the expected  future that are driving the need for a new platform? Answer:  Current deficiencies are: -Service Life.  The HH-60G is approaching the end of its useful service life. -Survivability.  Insufficient survivability (susceptibility and vulnerability)  to ensure mission success against the Defense Planning Guidance (DPG) validated  threat environment. This includes a limited electronic warfare suite,  insufficient defensive armament for suppression of air and ground threats, and  inadequate protection from small arms fire -Range / Combat radius. Aircraft and rotor system design limit unrefueled  combat radius.  In certain theaters, these characteristics do not meet  Combatant Commanders mission requirements for mission execution. -Payload capacity / Cabin volume. Extremely limited cabin space for stowage and  employment of mission equipment and crew served weapons, infiltration of  Recovery Teams, exfiltration of Recovery Teams and isolated personnel, and  medical treatment of isolated personnel. -Battlespace awareness.  Lack of line-of-sight (LOS) and BLOS high speed LPE  data links for battle space/situational awareness of isolated personnel’s  location, threat information, and location of friendly forces. -Mission react time. Depr any additional questions to the PRV mailbox  SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil .  Please do not call.  If you wish to speak to someone  directly, send an e-mail to the PRV mailbox with the request.

Lack of line-of-sight (LOS) and BLOS high speed LPE  data links for battle space/situational awareness of isolated personnel’s  location, threat information, and location of friendly forces. -Mission react time. Deployment shortfalls that prevent current combat rescue  forces from being mission ready upon commencement of hostilities – the most  likely time for losses.  -Adverse weather capability.  Lack of adverse weather penetration system(s) to  perform PR missions in a combat environment. ACC conducted an AoA to evaluate potential solutions to current validated  deficiencies. A new medium-lift helicopter was recommended as the most cost- effective solution to replace the aging HH-60G. This recommendation was briefed  to and approved by the AFROC in June 01. 2. Question:  Could you describe the KPPs as they exist for the program now? Answer:   •The PRV with a full, standard configuration load (SCL) must have a straight- line unrefueled combat mission radius of 325 nautical miles (nm). •The downwash in and around the recovery vehicle produced by the PRV during Hot  Day tactical hover operations in all environments (to include heavily forested,  steep mountainous, smooth-level, rough-level, smooth-sloped, and rough-sloped  terrain in calm and high crosswind conditions with loose particles such as tree  limbs, sand, water or rocks in the hover zone) at mid-mission gross weights  with SCL in Appendix C must not prevent recovery team or injured and uninjured  isolated personnel safe operations (hover extraction operations (hoist),  providing emergency lifesaving measures to isolated personnel, placement of a  non-ambulatory personnel in a hoist recovery device, overland movement, self- protection, communication, and swimming). •The PRV must satisfy 100% of top level information exchange requirements (IER)  designated as critical.  Satisfaction is defined as sender/receiver must be  able to execute the required function/mission task without operator  intervention.  (Interoperability KPP).   •To support Air and Space Expeditionary Force (ASEF) tasking requiring little  or no warning, mission ready PRV aircraft, weapons, and support equipment must  be capable of worldwide self-deployment (4000 nm) and mission ready within 24  hours of notification or configurable to fit within existing transport aircraft  (USAF AMC C-5 and C-17 transport aircraft) within 3 hours of initial  notification and capable of being made mission ready within 3 hours upon  arrival at destination. 3. Question:  What is the projected timeline for the program? Answer:  To accelerate procurement and fielding as much as possible from the  currently planned IOC of 2014 4. Question:  Does the PRV program expect to utilize other platforms, such as    UAVs as part of its organic group of systems? Answer:  The mission area of CSAR is expected to utilize UAV gathered  information to support successful mission execution. 5. Question  Mr Vokits spoke of the "Technical Descriptions + Challenges."  Could any of those be shared? Answer:  The PIXS PRV website contains a downloadable copy of all the briefings  used at Industry Day, including those on Technical Descriptions + Challenges.   These are related to translating operational requirements into specific  technical understanding of the performance requirements.  The user, the  acquirer, the sustainer and Industry must maintain an active interface and  continual interaction throughout the acquisition and sustainment phases to  ensure there is minimal confusion on requirements interpretation.  This is  especially true when using an evolutionary acquisition approach (today+s  standard DOD approach to weapons systems procurement). 6.  Question:  Milestone dates for RFP, SDD award, first flight, opeval, LRIP,  RAA, FRP? Answer:  No milestone dates have been set.  Programmatics are still being  developed.  A draft schedule leading to contract award was part of the  information provided to industry.  Please refer to ASC PIXS web site as these  dates are developed.   7.  Question:  Structure and details of competitive phase?   Answer:  Programmatics are still being developed.  Please refer to ASC PIXS web  site for updates.   8.  Question:  Specific Block 0 vs. Block 10 capabilities    Answer:  The block approach requirements are still under development.  Please  refer to ASC PIXS web site for updates.   9.  Question:  Concepts for future spirals?   Answer:  Technology insertion and future requirements will be addressed in the  Draft RFP.   10.  Question:  Development and operational test plans? How many test flights  are planned?   Answer:  The details have not been worked out.  The Test + Evaluation Master  Plan (TEMP) has not been drafted but is anticipated on being completed by RFP  release.   11.  Question:  How is the program balancing the risks poised by the aggressive  development timeline?   Answer:  The Air force has a Risk Management Process.   This process will begin  with a Risk Workshop on 23 Mar 04 and will continue throughout the development  acquisition phase.   12.  Question:  From lessons learned in Iraq and Afghanistan, any changes to  requirements for performance, range, onboard capabilities, fleet size?   Answer:  The PRV ORD was developed from requirements derived during the CSAR  AoA. Lessons learned from Afghanistan and Iraq were incorporated during the  draft and coordination process.  They will continue to be analyzed as we write  and coordinate Change 1 to the ORD.  The process to produce Change 1 to  incorporate a Block modification approach has already begun. 13.  Question:  Any participation with navy and marines at this stage in the  program? Answer:  Not at this time.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 001 (6 Feb 04)- Industry Day Announcement  The Special Operations Forces-Combat Search and Rescue Systems Program Office  SOF-CSAR SPO) will host an Industry Day on 4 March 2004 at the Holiday Inn in  Fairborn, Ohio to inform industry of a new program to develop and procure 132  Personnel Recovery Vehicles (PRV).  This procurement activity is scheduled to  begin sometime later this year, and will be a very aggressive, quick moving  development program.  This Industry Day will be a one day event where the  program office will brief industry on what the program entails to ensure that  industry has an understanding of the requirements and intent of the PRV  program.    The agenda is being developed at this time.  It will include government  briefings on the program, possible acquisition strategies, operator  requirements and a question and answer session in the morning.  The afternoon  will be reserved for prime contractors to meet one-on-one with government  representatives to ask questions of a proprietary nature and describe their  unique abilities to meet the requirements stated in the operational  requirements document.    Individuals wishing to attend this Industry Day must register online via the  MarketSpace link at the bottom of this page.  This Industry Day is restricted  to United States citizens.  All attendees must present a government issued  photo identification, as well as a birth certificate or U.S. passport for registration on the day of the event.  The Industry Day will be oriented  toward rotary wing prime contractors; contractors who have the ability to  design and manufacture medium lift vertical take-off/landing medium lift class  vehicles.  Suppliers to these prime contractors will also be eligible to  attend.  Contractors who are interested in obtaining a copy of the draft Operational  Requirements Document (ORD) and a draft of the Statement of Objectives (SOO)  may request them by sending an e-mail message to SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil. All  requests must include the company name as well as the Commercial and Government  Entity (CAGE) code.  REGISTER FOR PRV INDUSTRY DAY: All individuals planning on attending the PRV Industry Day must register online  through MarketSpace via the link at the bottom of the announcement. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE (Initial) (29 Jan 04) The Special Operations Forces-Combat Search and Rescue Systems Program Office  at Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) is starting up a new program to develop  and procure 132 Personnel Recovery Vehicles (PRV).  This effort is follow-on to  the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) completed by Air Combat Command (ACC) in  2001 which recommend replacing 104 HH-60G light helicopters with 132 medium- lift helicopters for the combat search and rescue mission.  The responsibility  for combat search and rescue was transferred from ACC to Air Force Special  Operations Command (AFSOC) on 1 October 2003.  The operational requirements  developed by ACC at the end of the Analysis of Alternatives remain essentially  the same.  Recently, the USAF has decided to evaluate the possibility of  accelerating Initial Operational Capability of the PRV Program.   An Industry Day will be held on a date TBA (March 2004 timeframe) at a location  TBA in the Dayton, Ohio area.  A follow-up announcement specifying the date and  place is forthcoming.  This is an initial opportunity for industry to meet with  cognizant government representatives and discuss the known requirements and  intent of the PRV program.  This Industry Day will also provide industry an  opportunity to comment on the Operational Requirements Document (ORD), to be  provided at a later date, and for industry to express an interest in becoming a  contender in the PRV program.  Contractors will be given an overview of the PRV program.  Contractors will  also be given an opportunity to discuss their understanding of the program and  to present their capabilities/ concepts in general terms during subsequent  meetings with the government.  This is to be considered an initial step in  establishing industry understanding of the PRV program and to allow the  government team to determine market understanding and capability to integrate  and complete the program. This is not a Request for Proposal.  The Government does not intend to award a  contract on the basis of this announcement.  Submitting capabilities and  concepts in response to this announcement is voluntary, and participants shall  not be compensated.  Any organization or company can obtain Personnel Recovery Vehicle announcements  and instructions via the Web at http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil.   Questions regarding technical information and/or this announcement should be  directed to SOF PRV Program office at the following email address:   SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil.

<DESC>PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 004 (19 Mar 04)- Questions and Answers The following questiosn were submitted to the government.  All questions and  answers have been cleared through the Public Affairs office. 1.  Question:  Could you give a brief description of the areas that are not  currently met by the existing fleet of helicopters now or in the expected  future that are driving the need for a new platform? Answer:  Current deficiencies are: -Service Life.  The HH-60G is approaching the end of its useful service life. -Survivability.  Insufficient survivability (susceptibility and vulnerability)  to ensure mission success against the Defense Planning Guidance (DPG) validated  threat environment. This includes a limited electronic warfare suite,  insufficient defensive armament for suppression of air and ground threats, and  inadequate protection from small arms fire -Range / Combat radius. Aircraft and rotor system design limit unrefueled  combat radius.  In certain theaters, these characteristics do not meet  Combatant Commanders mission requirements for mission execution. -Payload capacity / Cabin volume. Extremely limited cabin space for stowage and  employment of mission equipment and crew served weapons, infiltration of  Recovery Teams, exfiltration of Recovery Teams and isolated personnel, and  medical treatment of isolated personnel. -Battlespace awareness.  Lack of line-of-sight (LOS) and BLOS high speed LPE  data links for battle space/situational awareness of isolated personnel’s  location, threat information, and location of friendly forces. -Mission react time. Deployment shortfalls that prevent current combat rescue  forces from being mission ready upon commencement of hostilities – the most  likely time for losses.  -Adverse weather capability.  Lack of adverse weather penetration system(s) to  perform PR missions in a combat environment. ACC conducted an AoA to evaluate potential solutions to current validated  deficiencies. A new medium-lift helicopter was recommended as the most cost- effective solution to replace the aging HH-60G. This recommendation was briefed  to and approved by the AFROC in June 01. 2. Question:  Could you describe the KPPs as they exist for the program now? Answer:   •The PRV with a full, standard configuration load (SCL) must have a straight- line unrefueled combat mission radius of 325 nautical miles (nm). •The downwash in and around the recovery vehicle produced by the PRV during Hot  Day tactical hover operations in all environments (to include heavily forested,  steep mountainous, smooth-level, rough-level, smooth-sloped, and rough-sloped  terrain in calm and high crosswind conditions with loose particles such as tree  limbs, sand, water or rocks in the hover zone) at mid-mission gross weights  with SCL in Appendix C must not prevent recovery team or injured and uninjured  isolated personnel safe operations (hover extraction operations (hoist),  providing emergency lifesaving measures to isolated personnel, placement of a  non-ambulatory personnel in a hoist recovery device, overland movement, self- protection, communication, and swimming). •The PRV must satisfy 100% of top level information exchange requirements (IER)  designated as critical.  Satisfaction is defined as sender/receiver must be  able to execute the required function/mission task without operator  intervention.  (Interoperability KPP).   •To support Air and Space Expeditionary Force (ASEF) tasking requiring little  or no warning, mission ready PRV aircraft, weapons, and support equipment must  be capable of worldwide self-deployment (4000 nm) and mission ready within 24  hours of notification or configurable to fit within existing transport aircraft  (USAF AMC C-5 and C-17 transport aircraft) within 3 hours of initial  notification and capable of being made mission ready within 3 hours upon  arrival at destination. 3.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 006 (31 Mar 04)- Sikorsky Briefing In response to questions during the one-on-on sessions between Prime  Contractors and the ASC/LUH at the 4 March Industry Day, Sikorsky plans to  brief the SPO on 14 April at 15:00 for about 1hour. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 005 (22 Mar 04)- Team 101 Briefing In response to questions during the one-on-on sessions between Prime  Contractors and the ASC/LUH at the 4 March Industry Day, Lockheed Team 101  plans to brief the SPO on 13 April at 10:00 for about 1 hour. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 004 (19 Mar 04)- Questions and Answers The following questions were submitted to the government.  All questions and  answers have been cleared through the Public Affairs office. 1.  Question:  Could you give a brief description of the areas that are not  currently met by the existing fleet of helicopters now or in the expected  future that are driving the need for a new platform? Answer:  Current deficiencies are: -Service Life.  The HH-60G is approaching the end of its useful service life. -Survivability.  Insufficient survivability (susceptibility and vulnerability)  to ensure mission success against the Defense Planning Guidance (DPG) validated  threat environment. This includes a limited electronic warfare suite,  insufficient defensive armament for suppression of air and ground threats, and  inadequate protection from small arms fire -Range / Combat radius. Aircraft and rotor system design limit unrefueled  combat radius.  In certain theaters, these characteristics do not meet  Combatant Commanders mission requirements for mission execution. -Payload capacity / Cabin volume. Extremely limited cabin space for stowage and  employment of mission equipment and crew served weapons, infiltration of  Recovery Teams, exfiltration of Recovery Teams and isolated personnel, and  medical treatment of isolated personnel. -Battlespace awareness.  Lack of line-of-sight (LOS) and BLOS high speed LPE  data links for battle space/situational awareness of isolated personnel’s  location, threat information, and location of friendly forces. -Mission react time. Deployment shortfalls that prevent current combat rescue  forces from being mission ready upon commencement of hostilities – the most  likely time for losses.  -Adverse weather capability.  Lack of adverse weather penetration system(s) to  perform PR missions in a combat environment. ACC conducted an AoA to evaluate potential solutions to current validated  deficiencies. A new medium-lift helicopter was recommended as the most cost- effective solution to replace the aging HH-60G. This recommendation was briefed  to and approved by the AFROC in June 01. 2. Question:  Could you describe the KPPs as they exist for the program now? Answer:   •The PRV with a full, standard configuration load (SCL) must have a straight- line unrefueled combat mission radius of 325 nautical miles (nm). •The downwash in and around the recovery vehicle produced by the PRV during Hot  Day tactical hover operations in all environments (to include heavily forested,  steep mountainous, smooth-level, rough-level, smooth-sloped, and rough-sloped  terrain in calm and high crosswind conditions with loose particles such as tree  limbs, sand, water or rocks in the hover zone) at mid-mission gross weights  with SCL in Appendix C must not prevent recovery team or injured and uninjured  isolated personnel safe operations (hover extraction operations (hoist),  providing emergency lifesaving measures to isolated personnel, placement of a  non-ambulatory personnel in a hoist recovery device, overland movement, self- protection, communication, and swimming). •The PRV must satisfy 100% of top level information exchange requirements (IER)  designated as critical.  Satisfaction is defined as sender/receiver must be  able to execute the required function/mission task without operator  intervention.  (Interoperability KPP).   •To support Air and Space Expeditionary Force (ASEF) tasking requiring little  or no warning, mission ready PRV aircraft, weapons, and support equipment must  be capable of worldwide self-deployment (4000 nm) and mission ready within 24  hours of notification or configurable to fit within existing transport aircraft  (USAF AMC C-5 and C-17 transport aircraft) within 3 hours of initial  notification and capable of being made mission ready within 3 hours upon  arrival at destination. 3. Question:  What is the projected timeline for the program? Answer:  To accelerate procurement and fielding as much as possible from the  currently planned IOC of 2014 4. Question:  Does the PRV program expect to utilize other platforms, such as    UAVs as part of its organic group of systems? Answer:  The mission area of CSAR is expected to utilize UAV gathered  information to support successful mission execution. 5. Question  Mr Vokits spoke of the "Technical Descriptions + Challenges."  Could any of those be shared? Answer:  The PIXS PRV website contains a downloadable copy of all the briefings  used at Industry Day, including those on Technical Descriptions + Challenges.   These are related to translating operational requirements into specific  technical understanding of the performance requirements.  The user, the  acquirer, the sustainer and Industry must maintain an active interface and  continual interaction throughout the acquisition and sustainment phases to  ensure there is minimal confusion on requirements interpretation.  This is  especially true when using an evolutionary acquisition approach (today+s  standard DOD approach to weapons systems procurement). 6.  Question:  Milestone dates for RFP, SDD award, first flight, opeval, LRIP,  RAA, FRP? Answer:  No milestone dates have been set.  Programmatics are still being  developed.  A draft schedule leading to contract award was part of the  information provided to industry.  Please refer to ASC PIXS web site as these  dates are developed.   7.  Question:  Structure and details of competitive phase?   Answer:  Programmatics are still being developed.  Please refer to ASC PIXS web  site for updates.   8.  Question:  Specific Block 0 vs. Block 10 capabilities    Answer:  The block approach requirements are still under development.  Please  refer to ASC PIXS web site for updates.   9.  Question:  Concepts for future spirals?   Answer:  Technology insertion and future requirements will be addressed in the  Draft RFP.   10.  Question:  Development and operational test plans? How many test flights  are planned?   Answer:  The details have not been worked out.  The Test + Evaluation Master  Plan (TEMP) has not been drafted but is anticipated on being completed by RFP  release.   11.  Question:  How is the program balancing the risks poised by the aggressive  development timeline?   Answer:  The Air force has a Risk Management Process.   This process will begin  with a Risk Workshop on 23 Mar 04 and will continue throughout the development  acquisition phase.   12.  Question:  From lessons learned in Iraq and Afghanistan, any changes to  requirements for performance, range, onboard capabilities, fleet size?   Answer:  The PRV ORD was developed from requirements derived during the CSAR  AoA. Lessons learned from Afghanistan and Iraq were incorporated during the  draft and coordination process.  They will continue to be analyzed as we write  and coordinate Change 1 to the ORD.  The process to produce Change 1 to  incorporate a Block modification approach has already begun. 13.  Question:  Any participation with navy and marines at this stage in the  program? Answer:  Not at this time.

Based upon your previous response to the PRV RFI and the current production  air vehicle that you have used as your PRV baseline, identify all PRV ORD KPPs  and thresholds that this baseline air vehicle (a.) can meet today; and (b.)  will meet by Jan 06. If any KPPs and/or thresholds that cannot be fully met,  identify the capability that can be provided.  2.  Identify which version of your current production you used as your baseline  air vehicle.  Provide your response NLT 19 Aug 04 at 1600 EST. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 015 (5 AUG 04)-Hoist Requirements In response to a question concerning additional hoist requirements, the  Government provides the following response: At this time, we have no additional specification requirements other than the  ORD requirement for a hoist to conduct PRV missions.  Performance requirements  for PRV subsystems, such as the hoist, shall be generated by the Prime  Contractor after a PRV contract award. The PRV System Program Office will not  prepare subsystem requirement documents at any time. It is recommended that potential suppliers of PRV subsystems contact potential  Prime Integration PRV companies for information and integration at the  subsystem level. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 014 (27 Jul 04)-Program Office Estimate The Air Force team is working on a program office estimate (POE) for the  Personnel Recovery Vehicle (PRV).  The POE team is chartered to develop an  estimate by work breakdown structure (WBS) for SDD, production and O+S for a  fleet of 130 aircraft. The team is lead by the Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) cost staff and includes members of the PRV program office. The POE will be  establish as a cost guide for future PRV administrative hurdles including the  source selection process and MS B DAB review.    As a crucial POE building block for PRV presentations to DOD and AF review  boards, we would like to have actual cost from recently completed helicopter  programs as a starting point. We request that each participating RFI contractor  submit actual cost/price info from a recent sale of the proposed helicopter.  This info should justify the WBS level 3 information which you have previously  submitted. We are particularly interested in separating recurring and non- recurring airframe, engines, avionics and mission equipment for the development  and production portions of the program. Production weight of the airframe  should be included. Also, the information should be phased by year and  associated quantities (see below table).   	 	200X	 	200X	 	200X	 	200X  	      N/R    Rec     N/R    Rec	     N/R    Rec	      N/R   Rec Development	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Qty	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Airframe	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Engine 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Avionics	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Mission 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Production	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Qty	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Airframe	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Engine 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Avionics	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Mission 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Since some late summer acquisition briefings (Courses of Action) are required  we would like to have the information by 15 Aug 04 to incorporate into the POE.

All  requests must include the company name as well as the Commercial and Government  Entity (CAGE) code.  REGISTER FOR PRV INDUSTRY DAY: All individuals planning on attending the PRV Industry Day must register online  through MarketSpace via the link at the bottom of the announcement. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE (Initial) (29 Jan 04) The Special Operations Forces-Combat Search and Rescue Systems Program Office  at Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) is starting up a new program to develop  and procure 132 Personnel Recovery Vehicles (PRV).  This effort is follow-on to  the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) completed by Air Combat Command (ACC) in  2001 which recommend replacing 104 HH-60G light helicopters with 132 medium- lift helicopters for the combat search and rescue mission.  The responsibility  for combat search and rescue was transferred from ACC to Air Force Special  Operations Command (AFSOC) on 1 October 2003.  The operational requirements  developed by ACC at the end of the Analysis of Alternatives remain essentially  the same.  Recently, the USAF has decided to evaluate the possibility of  accelerating Initial Operational Capability of the PRV Program.   An Industry Day will be held on a date TBA (March 2004 timeframe) at a location  TBA in the Dayton, Ohio area.  A follow-up announcement specifying the date and  place is forthcoming.  This is an initial opportunity for industry to meet with  cognizant government representatives and discuss the known requirements and  intent of the PRV program.  This Industry Day will also provide industry an  opportunity totry on what the program entails to ensure that  industry has an understanding of the requirements and intent of the PRV  program.    The agenda is being developed at this time.  It will include government  briefings on the program, possible acquisition strategies, operator  requirements and a question and answer session in the morning.  The afternoon  will be reserved for prime contractors to meet one-on-one with government  representatives to ask questions of a proprietary nature and describe their  unique abilities to meet the requirements stated in the operational  requirements document.    Individuals wishing to attend this Industry Day must register online via the  MarketSpace link at the bottom of this page.  This Industry Day is restricted  to United States citizens.  All attendees must present a government issued  photo identification, as well as a birth certificate or U.S. passport for registration on the day of the event.  The Industry Day will be oriented  toward rotary wing prime contractors; contractors who have the ability to  design and manufacture medium lift vertical take-off/landing medium lift class  vehicles.  Suppliers to these prime contractors will also be eligible to  attend.  Contractors who are interested in obtaining a copy of the draft Operational  Requirements Document (ORD) and a draft of the Statement of Objectives (SOO)  may request them by sending an e-mail message to SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil. All  requests must include the company name as well as the Commercial and Government  Entity (CAGE) code.  REGISTER FOR PRV INDUSTRY DAY: All individuals planning on attending the PRV Industry Day must register online  through MarketSpace via the link at the bottom of the announcement.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 006 (31 Mar 04)- Sikorsky Briefing In response to questions during the one-on-on sessions between Prime  Contractors and the ASC/LUH at the 4 March Industry Day, Sikorsky plans to  brief the SPO on 14 April at 15:00 for about 1hour. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 005 (22 Mar 04)- Team 101 Briefing In response to questions during the one-on-on sessions between Prime  Contractors and the ASC/LUH at the 4 March Industry Day, Lockheed Team 101  plans to brief the SPO on 13 April at 10:00 for about 1 hour. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 004 (19 Mar 04)- Questions and Answers The fent and fielding as much as possible from the  currently planned IOC of 2014 4. Question:  Does the PRV program expect to utilize other platforms, such as    UAVs as part of its organic group of systems? Answer:  The mission area of CSAR is expected to utilize UAV gathered  information to support successful mission execution. 5. Question  Mr Vokits spoke of the "Technical Descriptions + Challenges."  Could any of those be shared? Answer:  The PIXS PRV website contains a downloadable copy of all the briefings  used at Industry Day, including those on Technical Descriptions + Challenges.   These are related to translating operational requirements into specific  technical understanding of the performance requirements.  The user, the  acquirer, the sustainer and Industry must maintain an active interface and  continual interaction throughout the acquisition and sustainment phases to  ensure there is minimal confusion on requirements interpretation.  This is  especially true when using an evolutionary acquisition approach (today+s  standard DOD approach to weapons systems procurement). 6.  Question:  Milestone dates for RFP, SDD award, first flight, opeval, LRIP,  RAA, FRP? Answer:  No milestone dates have been set.  Programmatics are still being  developed.  A draft schedule leading to contract award was part of the  information provided to industry.  Please refer to ASC PIXS web site as these  dates are developed.   7.  Question:  Structure and details of competitive phase?   Answer:  Programmatics are still being developed.  Please refer to ASC PIXS web  site for updates.   8.  Question:  Specific Block 0 vs. Block 10 capabilities    Answer:  The block approach requirements are still under development.  Please  refer to ASC PIXS web site for updates.   9.  Question:  Concepts for future spirals?   Answer:  Technology insertion and future requirements will be addressed in the  Draft RFP.   10.  Question:  Development and operational test plans? How many test flights  are planned?   Answer:  The details have not been worked out.  The Test + Evaluation Master  Plan (TEMP) has not been drafted but is anticipated on being completed by RFP  release.   11.  Question:  How is the program balancing the risks poised by the aggressive  development timeline?   Answer:  The Air force has a Risk Management Process.   This process will begin  with a Risk Workshop on 23 Mar 04 and will continue throughout the development  acquisition phase.   12.  Question:  From lessons learned in Iraq and Afghanistan, any changes to  requirements for performance, range, onboard capabilities, fleet size?   Answer:  The PRV ORD was developed from requirements derived during the CSAR  AoA. Lessons learned from Afghanistan and Iraq were incorporated during the  draft and coordination process.  They will continue to be analyzed as we write  and coordinate Change 1 to the ORD.  The process to produce Change 1 to  incorporate a Block modification approach has already begun. 13.  Question:  Any participation with navy and marines at this stage in the  program? Answer:  Not at this time.

<DESC>PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 023 (11 JAN 05) – SRD RFI extension and Q+A on SRD RFI  SRD RFI as shown in Amendment 20 has extended the deadline for response from 11  Jan 05 to 26 Jan 2005. Clarification on SRD RFI: Question:  Requirements of sections 3.3.7.8, 3.3.9.3.4, 3.3.9.3.5, and  3.3.9.4.1.4 appear to exceed the CDD. We just wanted to confirm the intent,  understanding that this is certainly your prerogative. Response:  With respect to 3.3.7.8., the SRD does not necessarily exceed the  CDD but rather reflects the use of this capability for night missions and  reducing crew workload.  (Ref CDD:  "Night missions and crew workload require  the use of artificial aids to enable night operations.  Night operations  include the use of Night Vision Imaging System (NVIS) goggles, infrared  detection set (IDS), and helmet mounted displays (HMD) or other  technologies.")  However, at this point in time we do not know the full extent  to which HMDs will be used. Question:  "The PRV attributes needed to support Initial Operational Capability  (Block 0) are addressed by Section 3 statements without symbol markings and  those that are followed by "T", unless specifically marked as Block 10 (defined  as full capability). ..."  This essentially says that anything with no markings  or a "T" is a Block 0 requirement, which means nearly everything is a Block 0  requirement.  Is this correct? Response:  Yes, items with no markings or a "T" are Block 0 requirements as  stated by the User. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 022 (07 JAN 05) - Request for Information  See below attached file for RFI (MS word document) and CDD-RFI (MS Excel  document). Responses are due NLT 1600 EST, 13 Jan 05.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 021 (14 DEC 04)- Risk/schedule reduction  efforts  The Air Force intends to issue four contracts in support of risk/schedule  reduction efforts in support of the planned competition for the Personnel  Recovery Vehicle (PRV).  These contracts will be issued to the contractors who  have currently expressed interest in proposing for the PRV program.  The goal  of the contracts will be to enable the acceleration of the performance of the  PRV program after award.  The four contracts are planned to be issued to  Northrop Grumman, Bell-Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Sikorsy at an estimated  value of $1.25M each. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE (09 DEC 04) – Archived solicitation/synopsis  information See below attached file for archived PIXS soliciation synopsis information  (initial through Amendment 20).

<DESC>PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 015 (5 AUG 04)-Hoist Requirements In response to a question concerning additional hoist requirements, the  Government provides the following response: At this time, we have no additional specification requirements other than the  ORD requirement for a hoist to conduct PRV missions.  Performance requirements  for PRV subsystems, such as the hoist, shall be generated by the Prime  Contractor after a PRV contract award. The PRV System Program Office will not  prepare subsystem requirement documents at any time. It is recommended that potential suppliers of PRV subsystems contact potential  Prime Integration PRV companies for information and integration at the  subsystem level. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 014 (27 Jul 04)-Program Office Estimate The Air Force team is working on a program office estimate (POE) for the  Personnel Recovery Vehicle (PRV).  The POE team is chartered to develop an  estimate by work breakdown structure (WBS) for SDD, production and O+S for a  fleet of 130 aircraft. The team is lead by the Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) cost staff and includes members of the PRV program office. The POE will be  establish as a cost guide for future PRV administrative hurdles including the  source selection process and MS B DAB review.    As a crucial POE building block for PRV presentations to DOD and AF review  boards, we would like to have actual cost from recently completed helicopter  programs as a starting point. We request that each participating RFI contractor  submit actual cost/price info from a recent sale of the proposed helicopter.  This info should justify the WBS level 3 information which you have previously  submitted. We are particularly interested in separating recurring and non- recurring airframe, engines, avionics and mission equipment for the development  and production portions of the program. Production weight of the airframe  should be included. Also, the information should be phased by year and  associated quantities (see below table).   	 	200X	 	200X	 	200X	 	200X  	      N/R    Rec     N/R    Rec	     N/R    Rec	      N/R   Rec Development	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Qty	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Airframe	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Engine 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Avionics	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Mission 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Production	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Qty	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Airframe	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Engine 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Avionics	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Mission 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Since some late summer acquisition briefings (Courses of Action) are required  we would like to have the information by 15 Aug 04 to incorporate into the POE.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 006 (31 Mar 04)- Sikorsky Briefing In response to questions during the one-on-on sessions between Prime  Contractors and the ASC/LUH at the 4 March Industry Day, Sikorsky plans to  brief the SPO on 14 April at 15:00 for about 1hour. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 005 (22 Mar 04)- Team 101 Briefing In response to questions during the one-on-on sessions between Prime  Contractors and the ASC/LUH at the 4 March Industry Day, Lockheed Team 101  plans to brief the SPO on 13 April at 10:00 for about 1 hour. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 004 (19 Mar 04)- Questions and Answers The following questions were submitted to the government.  All questions and  answers have been cleared through the Public Affairs office. 1.  Question:  Could you give a brief description of the areas that are not  currently met by the existing fleet of helicopters now or in the expected  future that are driving the need for a new platform? Answer:  Current deficiencies are: -Service Life.  The HH-60G is approaching the end of its useful service life. -Survivability.  Insufficient survivability (susceptibility and vulnerability)  to ensure mission success against the Defense Planning Guidance (DPG) validated  threat environment. This includes a limited electronic warfare suite,  insufficient defensive armament for suppression of air and ground threats, and  inadequate protection from small arms fire -Range / Combat radius. Aircraft and rotor system design limit unrefueled  combat radius.  In certain theaters, these characteristics do not meet  Combatant Commanders mission requirements for mission execution. -Payload capacity / Cabin volume. Extremely limited cabin space for stowage and  employment of mission equipment and crew served weapons, infiltration of  Recovery Teams, exfiltration of Recovery Teams and isolated personnel, and  medical treatment of isolated personnel. -Battlespace awareness.  Lack of line-of-sight (LOS) and BLOS high speed LPE  data links for battle space/situational awareness of isolated personnel’s  location, threat information, and location of friendly forces. -Mission react time. Deployment shortfalls that prevent current combat rescue  forces from being mission ready upon commencement of hostilities – the most  likely time for losses.  -Adverse weather capability.  Lack of adverse weather penetration system(s) to  perform PR missions in a combat environment. ACC conducted an AoA to evaluate potential solutions to current validated  deficiencies. A new medium-lift helicopter was recommended as the most cost- effective solution to replace the aging HH-60G. This recommendation was briefed  to and approved by the AFROC in June 01. 2. Question:  Could you describe the KPPs as they exist for the program now? Answer:   •The PRV with a full, standard configuration load (SCL) must have a straight- line unrefueled combat mission radius of 325 nautical miles (nm). •The downwash in and around the recovery vehicle produced by the PRV during Hot  Day tactical hover operations in all environments (to include heavily forested,  steep mountainous, smooth-level, rough-level, smooth-sloped, and rough-sloped  terrain in calm and high crosswind conditions with loose particles such as tree  limbs, sand, water or rocks in the hover zone) at mid-mission gross weights  with SCL in Appendix C must not prevent recovery team or injured and uninjured  isolated personnel safe operations (hover extraction operations (hoist),  providing emergency lifesaving measures to isolated personnel, placement of a  non-ambulatory personnel in a hoist recovery device, overland movement, self- protection, communication, and swimming). •The PRV must satisfy 100% of top level information exchange requirements (IER)  designated as critical.  Satisfaction is defined as sender/receiver must be  able to execute the required function/mission task without operator  intervention.  (Interoperability KPP).   •To support Air and Space Expeditionary Force (ASEF) tasking requiring little  or no warning, mission ready PRV aircraft, weapons, and support equipment must  be capable of worldwide self-deployment (4000 nm) and mission ready within 24  hours of notification or configurable to fit within existing transport aircraft  (USAF AMC C-5 and C-17 transport aircraft) within 3 hours of initial  notification and capable of being made mission ready within 3 hours upon  arrival at destination. 3. Question:  What is the projected timeline for the program? Answer:  To accelerate procurement and fielding as much as possible from the  currently planned IOC of 2014 4. Question:  Does the PRV program expect to utilize other platforms, such as    UAVs as part of its organic group of systems? Answer:  The mission area of CSAR is expected to utilize UAV gathered  information to support successful mission execution. 5. Question  Mr Vokits spoke of the "Technical Descriptions + Challenges."  Could any of those be shared? Answer:  The PIXS PRV website contains a downloadable copy of all the briefings  used at Industry Day, including those on Technical Descriptions + Challenges.   These are related to translating operational requirements into specific  technical understanding of the performance requirements.  The user, the  acquirer, the sustainer and Industry must maintain an active interface and  continual interaction throughout the acquisition and sustainment phases to  ensure there is minimal confusion on requirements interpretation.  This is  especially true when using an evolutionary acquisition approach (today+s  standard DOD approach to weapons systems procurement). 6.  Question:  Milestone dates for RFP, SDD award, first flight, opeval, LRIP,  RAA, FRP? Answer:  No milestone dates have been set.  Programmatics are still being  developed.  A draft schedule leading to contract award was part of the  information provided to industry.  Please refer to ASC PIXS web site as these  dates are developed.   7.  Question:  Structure and details of competitive phase?   Answer:  Programmatics are still being developed.  Please refer to ASC PIXS web  site for updates.   8.  Question:  Specific Block 0 vs. Block 10 capabilities    Answer:  The block approach requirements are still under development.  Please  refer to ASC PIXS web site for updates.   9.  Question:  Concepts for future spirals?   Answer:  Technology insertion and future requirements will be addressed in the  Draft RFP.   10.  Question:  Development and operational test plans? How many test flights  are planned?   Answer:  The details have not been worked out.  The Test + Evaluation Master  Plan (TEMP) has not been drafted but is anticipated on being completed by RFP  release.   11.  Question:  How is the program balancing the risks poised by the aggressive  development timeline?   Answer:  The Air force has a Risk Management Process.   This process will begin  with a Risk Workshop on 23 Mar 04 and will continue throughout the development  acquisition phase.   12.  Question:  From lessons learned in Iraq and Afghanistan, any changes to  requirements for performance, range, onboard capabilities, fleet size?   Answer:  The PRV ORD was developed from requirements derived during the CSAR  AoA. Lessons learned from Afghanistan and Iraq were incorporated during the  draft and coordination process.  They will continue to be analyzed as we write  and coordinate Change 1 to the ORD.  The process to produce Change 1 to  incorporate a Block modification approach has already begun. 13.  Question:  Any participation with navy and marines at this stage in the  program? Answer:  Not at this time. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 003 (15 Mar 04)- Classified Documents The following information is required to request classified PRV documents: - Cage Code - Name of the Document - Your Company+s Security Manager+s (SM) name, phone number and classified  mailing address NOTE 1:  If  ASC/LUH (PRV) is not the originator of the requested document,  approval would be required from the originator prior to releasing the document  to the requestor.    Document requests will be forwarded to the originator by  ASC/LU Security Office.  You should expect a delay in the receipt of the  requested document if prior approval is required. NOTE 2:  Foreign Nationals:  Visit Notifications must be requested through the  appropriate embassy for visit approval. Please direct all requests and questions concerning classified documents to: Ms. Denise D. Quick Chief, ASC/LU Security 937-255-4713 1895 5th Street, Bldg 46 WPAFB, OH  45433 PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 002 (27 Feb 04)- One-On-One Questions The following questions are to be addressed during one-on-one meetings with the  Government and potential prime contractors: 1.  What are the main technical/capability differences between your current  production or anticipated design(s) and the aircraft needed to meet PRV ORD  thresholds. At a subsystem level, characterize the technical effort it would  take you to modify your current or anticipated design(s) to (a) a design with  the same capability as the current CSAR aircraft (HH-60G) and (b) a design that  meet all of the thresholds in the PRV ORD. 2.  Using your current production or anticipated design(s) as a technical  starting point, what would be the minimum timeframe, including long lead  procurement, and minimum number of test assets that would be required toA) completed by Air Combat Command (ACC) in  2001 which recommend replacing 104 HH-60G light helicopters with 132 medium- lift helicopters for the combat search and rescue mission.  The responsibility  for combat search and rescue was transferred from ACC to Air Force Special  Operations Command (AFSOC) on 1 October 2003.  The operational requirements  developed by ACC at the end of the Analysis of Alternatives remain essentially  the same.  Recently, the USAF has decided to evaluate the possibility of  accelerating Initial Operational Capability of the PRV Program.   An Industry Day will be held on a date TBA (March 2004 timeframe) at a location  TBA in the Dayton, Ohio area.  A follow-up announcement specifying the date and  place is forthcoming.  This is an initial opportunity for industry to meet with  cognizant government representatives and discuss the known requirements and  intent of the PRV program.  This Industry Day will also provide industry an  opportunity to comment on the Operational Requirements Document (ORD), to be  provided at a later date, and for industry to express an interest in becoming a  contender in the PRV program.  Contractors will be given an overview of the PRV program.  Contractors will  also be given an opportunity to discuss their understanding of the program and  to present their capabilities/ concepts in general terms during subsequent  meetings with the government.  This is to be considered an initial step in  establishing industry understanding of the PRV program and to allow the  government team to determine market understanding and capability to integrate  and complete the program. This is not a Request for Proposal.  The Government does not intend to award a  contract on the basis of this announcement.  Submitting capabilities and  concepts in response to this announcement is voluntary, and participants shall  not be compensated.  Any organization or company can obtain Personnel Recovery Vehicle announcements  and instructions via the Web at http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil.

Statement of Work for
Centralized, Outsourced Mailroom and Imaging Services 
For the Department of Labor, 
Division of Federal Employees’ Compensation


1.	Introduction:  

The Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs (OWCP/DFEC) administers the Federal Employees’ Compensation Act  (FECA).  FECA provides workers’ compensation coverage to three million Federal and Postal workers including wage replacement, medical and vocational rehabilitation benefits for work-related injury and occupational disease.  Compensation claims filed under the Federal Employee Compensation Act are processed by the Division of Federal Employees’ Compensation (DFEC) program.  

The process of adjudicating and managing these compensation claims requires Claims Examiners within DFEC District Offices to review a variety of documents that must be maintained as part of the case processing record of each claim.  These documents provide the supporting evidence of determinations regarding the admissibility of treatments, the amount of compensation to be granted, and other decisions related to the claim.  These case files, which can range in size from fewer than 20 pages to well over 1000, pose a significant paperwork management challenge for DFEC.

1.1	Purpose:

The purpose of the DFEC Mailroom and Imaging Outsourcing program is to establish a centralized mailroom and imaging capability that will achieve the following DFEC technical, management, cost, and risk mitigation objectives:

&#61692;	Improved mailroom, imaging, and data entry throughput and efficiency
&#61692;	Reduced mailroom, imaging, and data entry costs
&#61692;	Common workflow methodologies and process controls 
&#61692;	Established management and technical expertise
&#61692;	Common processing platform
&#61692;	Robust facility and equipment capacities in support of current and future requirements
&#61692;	Ready availability of back-up facilities, equipment and personnel
&#61692;	Established telecommunications capabilities
&#61692;	Implementation of uniform, established quality control procedure

2.	Requirements

The Contractor shall provide mailroom, scanning, and indexing services for Workers Compensation claim documents in accordance with the requirements stated herein.   

2.1	Tracking System

The Contractor shall maintain an automated system for inventory tracking and reporting of all program activities, as described in the following sections.  At a minimum, this system shall provide the following standard reports which shall be made available to OWCP/DFEC via secure Internet communications:

•	Real-time batch status
•	Backlog/Reconciliation Report
•	Turnaround Report – Snapshot of batch status
•	Quality Report
•	Reject Report

These reports shall reflect real-time statistics relating to production and turnaround service levels.  Additionally, as an option, the Contractor shall provide customized ad hoc reports reflecting unique reporting requirements and make these available to DOL on-line.   The reports should also be available in summary and detail formats, and where possible be made available in a downloadable/importable format. 

2.2	Facility

Mailroom services shall be performed at the Contractor’s facility.  The Contractor shall provide a modern state of the art facility. The Contractor shall maintain at least two geographically distinct facilities capable of supporting the capacity requirements stated in Section 3.1 Below.  These facilities must possess similar imaging and processing equipment in order to support OWCP/DFEC/DFEC in the event of a disaster.

2.3	Mail/Document Processing

Contractor shall process all DFEC mail and transmit data to DOL/DFEC within 48 hours from receiving the mail into the facility. Exceptions listed in section 2.4 Out Sorting.

2.3.1	Receiving

The Contractor shall receive incoming mail via third party courier and USPS at this location and prepare for processing.  Contractor shall establish USPS PO BOX.  Incoming mail will be labeled with appropriate district office identification.
  
Mail in shipping bags shall be received at the Contractor’s shipping dock. Trays of envelopes and packages will be extracted from the shipping bags. Identifying information shall be collected for the tray and used for inventory control and tracking purposes.  Each tray will be entered into the Tracking System, which shall produce real time reports that will be available to authorized OWCP/DFEC personnel via a secure Internet Web site.

Mailroom personnel will process the postal trays and provide an envelope volume count for each tray which will be entered into the Tracking System with the appropriate tray identifying information and employee identifying information.

Contractor shall only process envelopes from returned mail. 

2.3.2	Document Preparation

Document separator sheets will be placed between each multi-paged document.  The Separator sheet bar code will be read by the scanner and will indicate the beginning of a new document for sequencing purposes.  

2.3.3	Sorting

The sorting process will commence with the removal of envelopes from the postal trays, extraction of the contents of each envelope, and entry of the employee and mail data into the Tracking System.    If a Case numbers is not present on the document, the Contractor Shall look up the appropriate case number and annotate it on the document, for later index entry.  OWCP/DFEC will provide an extract of their database, with daily updates, for Contractor use in looking up case numbers.  Two percent of the routine mail is anticipated to require case number lookup.  The documents and associated attachments will be prepared for imaging by removing staples, paper clips, repairing torn pages and performing other necessary document preparation functions.

Contractor shall sort mail by document type and District Office.

Sorted tray data shall be entered into the Tracking System to allow the production of real-time Internet reports detailing the total number of sorted trays, by document type.

Documents shall be sorted into the following categories:

Contractor should be able to accept documents from other electronic sources including faxes and imaged files from Central Bill Contractor.

The scanner operators shall, at a minimum clean the scanner optics and paper transport at the beginning of each shift, as well as, at periodic intervals during each shift in order to maintain optimum image quality. At the beginning of each shift, scanner operators shall run the appropriate test target to verify image quality. The scanner will be calibrated at the beginning of each shift based on the results of the test target.  

The document imaging operators will feed the stack header sheets and associated documents within the stack through the scanners.  Scanners shall operate in duplex scanning mode with the threshold set to automate the deletion of blank pages.  As the documents are scanned, hard copy documents and images will be assigned a unique Document Control Number (DCN) as part of the index during the scanning process.  The DCN will be in a format acceptable to OWCP/DFEC and will be imprinted on the document pre-scan along with the case number.  Multi-page documents will contain the same DCN.  

As the documents are scanned, the corresponding images shall be electronically batched and transmitted to the production location for indexing. The Tracking System will be continuously updated with the location of each image. 

Upon completion of the document imaging process, the Tracking System shall produce real-time internet reports detailing the total number of documents scanned, by type, and by District Office.  The scanner operator shall delete batches that are not processed properly during capture.  An operator shall rescan these batches. 

The Contractor shall verify that the numbers of paper pages match the scanned pages.  Quality control personnel shall verify that images have been scanned correctly, blank pages have been dropped, and the image is viewable.  Poor quality source documents will be rescanned to improve quality and if quality does not improve pass a message in the description field indicating best scan possible.

<DESC>AMENDMENT #2—DCS RFI Q&A
1) About Data Collection Sensors/platforms:
	A) What is the vision as a platforms for the future/long range for handling data in a unified way, format, protocols, etc?
	Answer: NOAA/NESDIS provides a transmission service only.  Data formatting is the purview of the users.  There is some discussion in the user community oriented toward developing standards, but in the past the community has proven too diverse to come up with a workable standard.  Some work is ongoing to define a standard format descriptor, but has not progressed rapidly.  Again, this work is within the user community, not within NESDIS. 
	B) Will platform support IP enabling interface to take advantage of recent thrust for IP enabled gadgets? 

	Answer: There has been no discussion in this area.  Platforms are manufactured and sold by the private sector, and are designed to meet NOAA certification standards.  NOAA does not define interfaces or data protocol beyond ASCII and pseudo ASCII. If  NOAA and the manufacturing and user community are presented with a benefit to be derived from this use, we would take it under consideration. 
	C) Do you see any benefits in leveraging the technologies, like Software Defined Radios, to handle different wave forms for handling transmission/Receiving data using RF media?
	Answer: Yes.  Some manufacturers of transmitters already use Software Defined Radios in their transmitters, and NOAA's receive system uses Software Designed Radios. 
	D) Can NOAA can share/provide the list of items that are considered as a list of challenges for the next generation DCP for: i) Technological, ii) Capital intensive,  iii) operation costs,  sensors to collect different measurements,  iv) User critical needs for sending data collected from the DCPs.   (I really  appreciate any previously funded research in addressing the above or similar issues).
	Answer:  The question is not clear.  We believe the answer is that NOAA does not manufacture the DCP's, and this RFI is not intended to cover DCP's related technologies etc. 
	E) Are you planning to use any SMARTS for reconfiguring the DCS platform for future and how we handle the legacy  DCS platforms? 
	Answer: NOAA is investigating using our 2-way communication to provide for reconfiguring the DCS platforms, but has made no commitments.  Should we go to such a system, the legacy platforms would be grandfathered in until they are replaced by the user, or for a reasonable time period (i.e. five years or ten years). No plans to use SMARTS at this time.
2)   Do you entertain the Out of the Box ideas/solutions to get the end results in a more effective way, similar to a service provider business model in delivering data to the users? For the Service Provider, NOAA provides all the requirements for Service Level Metrics/Agreements, evaluation and monitoring the services delivered to the users of the data? 
	Answer: We believe the idea was that NOAA would entertain any solutions.  Implementation is not a guarantee, however, as the RFI clearly states that no contract will be awarded from this announcement.  Impacts on the user community must be considered in any solution.
3) Any constraints and directive in using the Frequency spectrum between DCS platforms and space craft and between space craft and ground data collection systems? 
	Answer: Yes.  It is described in RFI.

<DESC>Questions received on RFQ W74V8H-05-R-0022 Q1. Is there a tab C in the proposal? A1. Yes tab D should read tab C. Q2. Is Past Performance a part of the 10 page limit portion of the Technical Approach, or is Past Performance a separate section?  If so, is there a page limitation on Past Performance? A2. Past Performance is a separate section; there is no page limitation. Q3. It appears that some items such as PAPR blower units, batteries, chargers, staplers are missing from your list of required supplies under pricing.  Are there additional items that should be included?  A3.   36 Staplers. Q4a. On pg. 34 of the RFP under Mail Handling Requirements the statement reads -Analyze the samples using a PFPA approved process-.  This statement implies that there are already existing PFPA sample analysis processes which must be maintained/utilized. Is this correct?  A4a. Yes, this is correct. Q4b. If yes to above: Who is expected to perform these sample analyses-- the contractor for the work proposed here or existing (other) lab entities not part of this RFP? A4b. The contractor for the work proposed here- this is stated in the subsequent paragraphs. This paragraph in the question is the fourth paragraph of a related group of paragraphs, starting with the Paragraph beginning with --The contractor shall conduct PFPA approved surface screening of the inlet filters&.--.   Perhaps these related paragraphs of the sequence describing the testing would have been better laid out as: The contractor shall conduct PFPA approved surface sampling of the inlet filters from the downdraft table twice per day (after screening the morning shipment and at the end of the day).  It should take approximately 30 minutes for two people to accomplish the sampling using the basic steps below: a) Turn off the downdraft table and disconnect the filters from both ends of the downdraft table.  In doing so, the intake surface of the second (middle) filter should be visible. b) Using the filter-pads and sampling buffer provided by PFPA, moisten the filter-pads.  Rub the filter-pad across the filter surface, covering approximately a 12inch by 12inch region.  The sampled region should vary between samplings, allowing the total f ilter surface to be sampled over time. c) Re-assemble the downdraft table and turn its power back on.  Analyze the samples using a PFPA approved process. d) Record and report sampling information using a PFPA approved protocol after each sampling. Q5)   Since I see no requirements for personnel for this program who are trained in the use of molecular or immunological testing equipment for bio-threats, I surmise that this RFP details only the need for sampling personnel/mail processors, not technical  biological testing personnel. Is this correct? A5) There is NO REQUIREMENT for the contractor to provide personnel trained in molecular or immunological testing equipment for bio-threats. NO technical biological testing personnel are required for this contract. The testing that will be performed by personnel under this contract is very simple, and can be performed by personnel with NO laboratory training.  The testing kits used are very similar to test kits available to consumers as over-the-counter tests at a lo cal pharmacy. Please note that the due time/date has been extended to 1:00PM EST on 15 March 2005.

<DESC>NASA Headquarters is hereby soliciting information from small business sources to provide in-depth information technology systems, engineering and management services to NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C.  This array of support services is, among other factors, for NASA missions and other activities to inspire and motivate the Nation’s students and teachers to engage and educate the public, and to advance the scientific and technological capabilities of the Nation.  This requirement is a follow-on to the NASA ISEM task order W-19800 with Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) (under ITOP contract DTTS59-99-D-00444).  The current task order is a cost-plus-award fee arrangement.  To be considered a prime contractor source, small businesses must possess real experience in the technical and management areas addressed below and employ experienced staff that have actually managed and worked in these areas.  All qualified firms are encouraged to respond.   NASA Headquarters is seeking a vendor to provide integrated information technology, systems engineering and operations, and IT-related management support for all mission directorates and mission support organizations at NASA Headquarters.  As NASA Headquarters transforms into an organization that will lead the Agency in a One NASA environment, the follow-on to the ISEM task order must provide strategically-oriented services that go beyond those readily and fully available via past IT support contracts.  A prime contractor must have successful experience managing a multi-million dollar, multi-year IT contract.  If teaming arrangements are used to provide support services, evidence is required of operating under such arrangements in a support environment similar in both scope of work and dollar amount.  Evidence is also required that such teaming arrangements are in place today and can be delivered for this effort.  The formal transition period from the incumbent vendor to the new vendor is estimated to be 30 days; experience transitioning as the prime contractor under similar circumstances is required. NASA requires a vendor to manage and provide a wide range of IT services, including (quantities noted are approximate indications of current levels):   -Application Software and Multimedia  Development *Application Software Development: 150 production applications, 160 releases annually, Majority are web based; balance are client server, and mainframe based, Oracle and SQL Server database back ends, Cold Fusion MX front ends, Application documentation, Configuration and release management   *Multimedia development: 50 production web sites, 10 CDROM releases annually, 3 DVD releases annually, Usability and accessibilities studies, Creative services relating to various digital media (signage, video, online documents, etc.) -Software integration:  *COTS and GOTS *Technical and Management:Schedule coordination, Testing coordination, Outreach -Web Development *50 Web sites *Creative design -IT Security *Incident Prevention: Intrusion detection and computer forensics, Anti-virus, Log monitoring and review, Education *Incident Response: CERT, NASIRC *Security plans: NIST requirements, Major systems, Contingency plans *Life cycle reviews: Hardware, Software *Vulnerability Monitoring: Scanning, Determination, Industry and media secondary research *Security Policy development and review: Penetration testing *Security Reviews: Other contractor systems and facilities -Full realm of systems integration, e.g., *E-Gov implementations *Requirements specifications for contract solicitations *Evaluation, coordination, testing, and integration of Application Service Provider capabilities   -Systems engineering and integration -Computer operations -Data Base Administration  -Network (wired and wireless) *design *implementation *operation and management -Configuration management  -Emergency preparedness  -Continuity of Operations planning, preparation and testing  -IT training  -Project management planning and execution support Systems life cycle management  -Telecommunications  *Phones *Faxes *Wireless devices: BlackBerry devices, PDAs, Pagers  -Collaborative tools analysis, testing, implementation, and operation -Knowledge/Information management -Strategy and planning support -Support for policy development -Life-Cycle Performance/Cost Improvements/Business Process Re-Engineering support -Support for NASA and Federal Enterprise Architecture analysis, development, and maintenance -Support for IT business case preparation, analysis, and maintenance -Support for IT investment portfolio management -Support for IT capabilities value determination -Risk management -Change management support -Analyses and integration of advanced technologies *Continually infuse management, work and technology innovations *Recommend technology upgrades keeping with industry and NASA strategic direction -Special studies and analyses that span virtually all IT-related disciplines  In addition, the following qualifications are required: -Must have vendor experience simultaneously managing in the range of 30 separate task orders for approximately 15 customer organizations.  The annual value of the individual tasks managed concurrently is expected to range from several hundred thousand dollars to $10 plus million dollars.  -Must have technical and management corporate resources to be able to respond quickly and flexibly in a highly dynamic environment.  NASA Headquarters is a very demanding environment with requirements for high level technical and management support expertise.   Leading edge technology is required to be analyzed, tested, integrated, and delivered on very short notice.  Work is directly impacted by the complexities of the environment, the related processes, and the interrelationships of the systems and multi-faceted projects to be supported.  Customers are highly knowledgeable in the use of technology, and use various platforms and operating systems including Windows, Macintosh, and Linux based systems.  In addition to the core task work (which is in support of all NASA Headquarters organizations) defined in the initial contract statement of work, other separate IT task orders within the contract scope are initiated frequently by various NASA Headquarters organizations to fulfill their unique and new technology and management support requirements.  Currently, about one third of the total work is for core support and the other two thirds isare for other IT task orders.  The “service requests” for specific needs within a defined task order require individual tracking and management from outset to completion.	There are approximately 500 such service requests per year, and this level is expected to increase in the future.   -Must have current use of advanced information technology tools, systems, and methods in managing their own corporate environment to demonstrate their full understanding of such technology in a production environment.  NASA HQ may choose to draw upon and benefit from these tools, systems and methods by implementing process changes and operating improvements already proven by the prime contractor.  The prime contractor should have in place their own Enterprise Architecture, and be using a portfolio management approach for their IT investment strategies and decision making.   The prime contractor should have internally realized process efficiencies through business process reengineering efforts and change management, and should have deployed an internal “knowledge management” capability.  -Must have experience developing and implementing IT products in an environment where the computer desktop environment is managed by another company.  Must have experience coordinating extensively with the desktop vendor for project planning and implementing products and solutions.   -Must have a management team experienced in supporting a Federal government Headquarters level organization with over 2,000 persons, and experience integrating solutions across a Federal government organization with multiple local and field offices.	The Headquarters customer base spans NASA Headquarters, the NASA field centers, special off-site locations for groups such as Presidential appointed commissions and other highly visible activities, and staff assigned at international locations.  As a prime contractor, the vendor must have successfully managed an IT contract with a large IT professional workforce utilizing multiple subcontractors.   -Must have experience and the capability to produce both aggregate and 30 or more individual task order financial reports equivalent to the NASA “533 reports” to the COTR and individual task owners each month.	 -Must have strong financial depth to be able to manage risk and deliver consistent, high quality support under conditions of incremental funding and incremental payments. -Must have configuration management experience for a technically complex hardware and software environment.   -Must have experience in supporting E-Gov initiatives commensurate with the President’s Management Agenda.  Support is required assisting NASA Headquarters offices in planning for and accomplishing the integration of IT capabilities into programs and projects that span NASA centers and external partners. This support includes planning and deploying major IT initiatives across NASA Centers and the NASA Shared Services Center (NSSC); between NASA and other federal agencies (especially E-Gov initiatives); between NASA and industry and academic partners; and between NASA and foreign space agency partners.   -Must have a quality certification, preferably ISO 9001:2000 or a reasonable equivalent. The anticipated period of performance will be five years. The current NAICS Code is 541519.  No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service. It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.  Interested sources should have the required specialized capabilities to meet the above requirement and should submit a capability statement indicating the ability to perform all aspects of the effort described herein.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION.  NOAA does not intend to award a contract based on this information.  This Sources Sought/Request for Information (RFI) is for planning and market research purposes only.  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is seeking information from industry regarding satellite bandwidth options to supplement and possibly replace its Inmarsat Satellite System currently being used.  At this time NOAA is not certain what the most appropriate, cost efficient method is to fulfill its bandwidth needs, as such industry is sought to provide information relative to the goals set forth below.   

BACKGROUND:  Since the early 80's NOAA vessels have used the Inmarsat Satellite System in a dial up mode for voice, data and file transfer. While costs have come down this alternative no longer meets NOAA's needs. At this time NOAA has 18 active vessels. 14 are equipped with Inmarsat-B High Speed Terminals; 12 of which are manufactured by Nera and 2 are manufactured by Furuno. One vessel is equipped with a Fleet 55 system and one coastal vessel, uses cellular. NOAA anticipates adding up to 6 vessels to this fleet in the next 8 years. 
Descriptions of the current NOAA Fleet can be viewed at: www.moc.noaa.gov.  Currently the Inmarsat-B equipped vessels use the system for e-mail, large file transfer and voice. Vessels establish a connection at an average rate of two to four times in a 24 hour period.  In addition, these same vessels will utilize cellular for both voice and data when in range of a cellular data service area.

From the research conducted to date, NOAA believes that there are two (2) distinctly different ways to satisfy its need(s) as follows:

Option 1:  Implement 24/7 always on or always available access that will provide a minimum 128kbps bandwidth to equip 8 of the 14 vessels with this minimum capability. Three (3) of these 8 vessels will routinely operate in remote areas of the Pacific Ocean between 45 degrees north and 45 degrees south latitudes. All 8 of these vessels are equipped with Nera-B High Speed terminals.  NOAA desires the ability to lease sufficient bandwidth to allow for up to four (4) vessels to automatically share the bandwidth, with each vessel receiving the minimum 128kbps, or one (1) vessel utilizing the full 512kbps. 

Option 2:  Change its business practices to implement sending raw data to shore rather than processing it aboard the vessel. Minimum requirement for this enhanced capability would be the equivalent of T-1 service (1.54Mbps) for 6 of the 14 vessels. Also desired with this service is "voice over IP" or some method of converting analog voice to data for transmission over the data link.  Each of these 6 vessels will routinely operate in remote areas of both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans between 60 degrees north and 60 degrees south latitudes. One of these vessels, will, on occasion, require communications around the world. 

Under both options listed above, Virtual Private Network (VPN) service from the vessel to NOAA servers ashore is necessary. All data  to and  from an earth station must be transferred to NOAA Headquarters in  Silver Spring, MD using a VPN with 1.54 Mbps or a dedicated point-to-point T1 connection.  Data must be secure from end to end. Data to be passed will be both personal and government "for official use only". No classified data is anticipated.

NOAA will require that service providers have repair facilities on the East, West and Gulf Coasts of the continental U.S. as well as repair facilities in Hawaii and Alaska. The option to lease or own the actual vessel equipment is part of the market research being conducted; therefore, industry is welcome to provide information on this requirement as well. 

The general parameters to consider when providing feedback are:

1) Can your firm offer one of the above listed options?  If so, is it currently available today? 
2) Can a general order of magnitude as to cost be provided for one or both options?  If so please provide with feedback to assist in the decision making process. 
3) Can either option be provided for a period of two (2) years?
4) What other alternative methods or combinations of methods to meeting the need as described above do you recommend?  

Interested firms are requested to provide feedback to the above general parameters.  Interested firms are asked to provide feedback via e-mail to Melissa Sampson at Melissa.r.sampson@noaa.gov by March 28, 2005.   This is again for information purposes only and to identify potential sources, The Government will not pay for any material provided to it in response to this synopsis and submittals will not be returned to the sender.  Questions regarding this request for information should be directed to Ms Sampson at 757-441-6561.

<SUBJECT>D -- USES Non-preemptable Telecommunications Services for the United States Antarctic Program (USAP)
<SOLNBR>SSC-Charleston_MKTSVY_261EE
<RESPDATE>040405
<CONTACT>Point of Contact - Joanne Banks, Contract Specialist,  843-218-5953
<DESC>1    Introduction 1.1   The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center (SPAWARSYSCEN), Charleston intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) employing FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items. The estimated value of this firm fixed price, indefinite-delivery indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract is $9.9 million consisting of one (1) base year plus four (4) one-year option periods.  This effort is to procure non-preemptable telecommunications services for the United States Antarctic Program (USAP) consisting of a C-Band satellite space segment in the Pacific Ocean Region (POR), teleport services, and terrestrial circuits. 2     Existing Service 2.1   Existing telecommunications service between McMurdo Station, Antarctica and the Continental United States (CONUS) is provided via INTELSAT 701, in the 180 degree East geostationary orbital position, with a local elevation look angle of 3.2 degrees. The current space segment consists of a duplex T-1, INTELSAT Business Services (IBS) circuit between the USAP Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), 11 meter C-Band satellite earth station designated BLK-02F3 (INTELSAT F3 qualified antenna) located at Black Island, Antarctica. Black Island is located approximately 22 miles South of McMurdo Station, 78 degrees, 07 minutes, 46.484 seconds South Latitude, 166 degrees, 09 minutes, 01.558 seconds East Longitude.  GFE point-point microwave equipment provides circuit termination in McMurdo Station.  CONUS space segment termination is provided by the SES Americom earth station in Brewster, WA, at 48 degrees 08 minutes North Latitude, 119 degrees 41 minutes West Longitude. The CONUS tail end is terminated to a GFE General Data-Comm time domain multiplexer (GDC MUX) co-located at the Americom teleport and terrestrial circuits for provision of telephony and other data services to the USAP. Existing circuit diagrams and data are available upon request. 3     Transition 3.1   The Vendor shall provide information as to how they plan to transition service from the existing provider. The Vendor will transition from the existing service, using existing infrastructure, to the new expanded service using existing, new and/or modified infrastructure (not excluding the GDC MUX).  In the event that a planned transition to Internet Protocol (IP) only traffic, on the existing service, is not complete at the time of contract award, an additional GFE GDC MUX or other solution will be required at the National Science Foundationâ€™s (NSF) Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Contractor Facility/Centennial, Colorado (CF/C),  until the IP infrastructure is completed. The Vendor shall be prepared to provide service transition testing and certification(s) while minimizing downtime on existing Antarctic operations traffic. The preferred down-time should be limited to four (4) off-peak hours per day interleaved with the existing operational satellite service, over a period of up to 30 days, for testing and certification of the new service. Off-peak hours are tentatively defined as 1000 to 1400 GMT. 4     New Service Description 4.1   This acquisition shall provide a communications channel at rates no less than 3 million bits per second (Mbps), incrementally increasing to no greater than 10  Mbps to the GFE BLK-02F3 earth station on Black Island.  The Vendor shall furnish end-to-end connectivity including commercially leased C-Band space segment, teleport, and terrestrial communications circuits between the teleport and the CF/C located at 7400 S. Tucson Way Centennial, Colorado 80112-3938. 4.2   The baseline requirement includes one year of end-to-end connectivity for a single carrier, 3 Mbps data circuit with teleport services, terrestrial back haul services, and optional redundant terrestrial back haul capability to CF/C. The Government intends to operate the link to transport IP network traffic. Options to incrementally increase the space segment and terrestrial circuit bandwidth to a maximum of 10 Mbps should be included in the proposal. The Government desires various bandwidth increment increase options with attendant costs for each option. The Vendor shall identify proposed terrestrial circuit technology type and associated quality specifications (e.g. latency, jitter, bit error rate, etc.). 4.3   While the Government intends to initiate bidirectional service at a data rate of at least 3 Mbps, other factors may cause service to begin at T-1 (1.544 Mbps) and transition to the baseline 3 Mbps service within the first year of the contract.  The Vendor shall propose a flexible pricing structure that allows the Government to start service with a bidirectional T-1 data rate (1.544 Mbps) then increase to higher data rates at a later date if necessary without undue cost to the Government. 4.4   The estimated pricing structure in the proposal should include information on space segment reservation requirements, service ramp up times and terrestrial circuit service lead times at the various bandwidths proposed. 4.5   Given the legacy infrastructure and limited access to the Black Island earth terminal, offerors shall provide infrastructure recommendations to achieve the 10 Mbps end state throughput. Black Island, Antarctica is only accessible from October 1 to February 15th each year. 4.6   The Vendor will be responsible for identifying, managing and conducting any certification testing required by the satellite operator, teleport operator, or other Government agencies. The Vendor shall provide all services necessary to operate the teleport equipment and shall pay all fees associated with operating the teleport. The teleport shall provide all Radio Frequency equipment necessary to access the satellite. The terrestrial teleport should be located in a position that minimizes the terrestrial circuit distance while maintaining access to the proposed satellite. 4.7   The Vendor will provide satellite modem(s) at the designated teleport with compatible technical characteristics (e.g. data rate, modulation, forward error correction etc.), with modems selected by the Government for Black Island.  The current modem under consideration for use at Black Island is the EF Data CDM-600 Modem with High Rate Option and Turbo Codec with or without Low Density Parity Coding (to be determined) and should be considered as the baseline modem architecture.  Vendors may suggest alternatives along with the rationale for the alternative.  The Vendor will include modulation scheme recommendations that make most efficient use of spectrum. 5     Quality Specification 5.1   The end-to-end Operational Availability (Ao) of the link shall be at least 99.95% as measured by Vendor recommended performance metrics (e.g. outage minutes per month, etc.).  Ao will be based on bidirectional link performance.  If one path is down (i.e. Black Island Transmit or Receive), then the entire link is considered down. Clear sky Corrected Bit Error Rate (CBER) shall be no more than 1*10E-7 with 1*10E-9 or less as the objective rate.  Intervals when the CBER is higher than the value (TBD) established in the contract at either ground station will be considered outage periods for Ao calculation.  The Vendor may also include in their proposal other system performance quality metrics that provide an overall assessment of link performance. 6     GFE Optional for Vendor teleport 6.1   The Vendor teleport facility may be required to provide space for and/or to house GFE including, but not limited to, network equipment. The Vendor may be required to provide a separate circuit between the NSF O & M Contractor at CF/C and their teleport for management and configuration of the GFE network equipment. 7     Monitoring, Technical and Engineering Support 7.1   The Vendor shall provide monitoring of software and hardware on a continuous basis. The Vendor shall provide a read-only Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) monitoring interface to GFE network management systems with IP addresses provided by the Government to facilitate the monitoring of critical circuit performance and equipment.  The Vendor shall be available 24/7/365 via voice and data services (i.e. secure web, instant messaging, e-mail) for circuit coordination and trouble resolution. The use of SNMP Level 3 is preferred, but the Government will consider other alternatives with appropriate Vendor provided rationale. 7.2   The read-only SNMP generated monitoring interface, at a minimum, will include status of modems, SSPAs, network elements, Eb/No, and bit rate. The Vendor shall supply GFE maintenance support where applicable including, but not limited to, the existing GDC MUX equipment. 7.3   The Vendor shall provide general engineering support including, but not limited to, traffic transport, bandwidth upgrades, teleport reconfiguration and periodic circuit testing that might be required. The Vendor shall provide circuit diagrams and/or systems drawings with annual updates, outage reports, inventory reports, system documentation, maintenance manuals and operational procedures. The Vendor shall provide performance metrics that include trouble ticket closeout rate, mean time to respond for call back on a trouble report, circuit outage incidents, operational availability of circuits, and others. The Vendor shall develop and maintain a list of contacts and procedures necessary to interfacing with the National Science Foundationâ€™s Operations and Maintenance Contractor for circuit and teleport operations, call back response times, citation to trouble reporting and resolution.  The Vendor shall provide appropriate training for existing and/or new equipment installed during the course of this contract at CF/C. 8     Technical Approach 8.1   The Government is not seeking new and untried technical approaches to providing the service, but rather desires a solution that is industry accepted and low in technical risk. 8.2   The government currently does not foresee a requirement for the Vendor to install, or provide for Government installation of any equipment at the Black Island earth station. Proposals that include such an installation will be considered as long as there is clear benefit to the overall performance of the required service.  Any equipment proposed for installation at Black Island shall include a complete technical description including nomenclature, size, installation requirements, specific interface characteristics, and detailed power requirements. 9     Additional Requirements 9.1   Vendors shall also provide information on their ability to provide a complete end-to-end telecommunications solution to the USAP including Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) telephony interface, Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) circuit traffic transport, Wide Area Network (WAN) using TCI/IP and Internet. Service provider shall provide information on the Management, Technical, and Operational processes and procedures used to maintain the confidentially, integrity, and availability of the data transmitted across the Vendorâ€™s telecommunication infrastructure between designated USAP sites. This includes contingency planning (maintaining services even in the event of failure), disaster recovery (restoral of services in the event of failure), and third party access to either the data or systems that control the telecommunication equipment necessary for maintaining the service. The Vendor shall provide synchronous operation details including time standards and clocking. 10    Schedule 10.1        Note:  the desired Initial Operational Capability (IOC) date is Decemember 15, 2005 with a Final Operational Capability (FOC) of February 1, 2006.  If needed, a pre-solicitation conference date with be determined.

<CONTACT>Cheryl Hampton, 703-693-2144
<DESC>DCC-W is looking for SBA 8(a) firms who have the capability to perform services as outlined in the Statement of Work incorporated below.  SBA 8(a) firms interested in being considered for this contract should submit a detailed statement of their capa bilities to perform the services required by the Statement of Work, including details on any similar services of this type which the firm has performed in the past. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.    Federal Voting Assistance Programs Electronic Transmission Service  Statement of Work 1. General/Background									 Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP) is an integral part of the Nations electoral process.  FVAP provides citizens with a wide-range of information, assistance and resources to facilitate their participation in the democratic voting process under the provisions of the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA).  The Secretary of Defense is the Presidential designee responsible for the Federal functions of the UOCAVA. As part of FVAPs essential operations in carrying out its responsibility in administering the UOCAVA, the support capability to send and receive election materials electronically for citizens worldwide is required.  In prior years, the Program has maintai ned the Electronic Transmission Service (ETS), which supports FVAPs strategic goals by: ·	Enhancing democratization. ·	Improving leadership, management, and administration of the electoral processes. ·	Pursuing integration of changing information technologies and communication systems. ·	Managing effectively to ensure mission accomplishment. These goals correlate to FVAPs Mission Statement, which is to serve the American people and their Government, and encourages the democratic process by: ·	Informing and educating citizens worldwide of their right to vote. ·	Fostering voting participation. ·	Protecting the integrity of, and enhancing, the electoral process at Federal, State, and local levels. FVAPs ETS allows citizens covered by the Act and Local Election Officials (LEOs) to fax election materials (Federal Post Card Application (FPCA), Federal Write-In Absentee Ballot (FWAB), blank ballot, voted ballot and other election materials) to allow fo r timely receipt and return of these materials via the mail. The Electronic Transmission of election materials provides an alternative method of voting by those military personnel and U.S. Citizens overseas covered under the provisions of the UOCAVA.  FVAP, under strict controls to protect the integrity of the elect ion process, provides the Electronic Transmission Service (ETS) to these citizens.  The ETS is designed to serve those individuals covered by the UOCAVA and local election officials by allowing them to fax election materials (FPCAs, blank ballots, voted ballots and other election materials) when conditions do not allow for the timely rece ipt and return of these materials via the mail.  2. Scope											 A central processing site is required for the ETS, which shall provide an audit trail for all transactions.  The audit trail shall help ensure the transmitted materials are not altered or manipulated.  Failure to operate the ETS effectively will result in the disenfranchisement of absentee voters.   Activity for the ETS increases during the months leading up to a General Election for federal offices; therefore, it is expected that further support will be required during this period to include added personnel and equipment. 3. Government Furnished Equipment, Supplies, and Services				 1. Information and Documentation a.	FVAP will provide copies of the Voting Assistance Guide, FPCAs and other government printed materials that are needed to provide the service. b.

The system shall be able receive faxes and convert the faxes to PDF.  In addition, the system shall be able to receive emails with attached PDFs and convert the email and then transmit to a fax.  There should not be any requirement for the transmissions  to be physically handled by the staff.  The following are examples of the types of transmitted documents to/from the citizen and LEO: Fax Cover Sheet (Attachment #1) FPCA (Attachment #2) FWAB (Attachment #3) i.	The system shall be able to generate a confirmation once a fax or email has been transmitted to the recipient and that confirmation deliver ed to the initial sender via email or fax. j.	The required phone/fax lines to accommodate the operation.   k.	An archival system, consisting of hard drives, Compact Disc or tape, will be established and maintained to ensure the historical integrity of the database containing all transmitted documents. l.	A minimum of 8 incoming fax lines, in a rotary hunt group, shall be available with additional capability to respond to increasing volume if traffic warrants.      A minimum of 8 outgoing fax lines shall also be available with the capability to be increa sed as traffic warrants. m.	The base system shall be able to support additional activity or, the contractor shall be able to add additional equipment to meet the demand, so that processing is accomplished within the time frames specified.  This additional system capability shall b e placed in service within 24 hours of the base systems inability to maintain the transaction time specified in SOW.  It shall also be easily removed from operation when the volume returns to normal levels. n.

<SUBJECT>70--Clear Creek Decision Analysis and Adaptive Management Model
<DESC>The Department of Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, Northern California Area Office, Shasta Lake, California has a requirement for software upgrade and improvements of its Clear Creek Decision Analysis and Adaptive Management Model (Model).  Specifically, new field data and other observational information will be incorporated to improve rank order performance of the Model's channel and sediment transport component.  Following the data update and Model calibration, a sediment transport analysis, to quantify the relative benefits and costs of adding gravel in different amounts, places and grain size compositions, will be prepared. The purpose of this notice is to announce the intent to issue a purchase order on a firm, fixed-price, sole-source basis to ESSA Technologies Ltd. Suite 300, 1765 West 8th Avenue, Vancouver, BC, Canada V6J 5C6, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b) - Soliciting Competition and under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.   A determination by the Contracting Officer not to compete this action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  A Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition.   ESSA is uniquely technically qualified to perform and provide the specific updates to the Model.  ESSA initially developed the Model by contract issued by the Mid-Pacific Regional Office in 2001.  Initial Model development included obtaining all hydrologic, fishery, geomorphic, and power data, writing original programming code to construct the Model and associated sub-models, and end-user interfaces.  Subsequently, in fiscal year 2003, ESSA upgraded the various sub-models and provided technical training to Clear Creek Restoration Team members on how to operate the Model.  At the present time, ESSA is the only company that fully understands how the Model was constructed and operates, as well as having complete knowledge of the sub-model coding and interface.  Award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of costs, additional development and documentation costs, unacceptable delays and other unnecessary additional costs in fulfilling the agency's requirement that is not expected to be recovered through competition.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 511210, and the size standard is $21,000.000.00.  This notice will be the only official notice prior to award of the purchase order.  Anticipated award date is March 24, 2005.   This is NOT a request for competitive quotes.  The intent of this synopsis is for informational purposes only, however, any firm that believes that it can furnish the items described above is encouraged to give written notification to the Contracting Officer.  Supporting documentation must be furnished, in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to provide the above items.   All information received by March 23, 2005 will be considered by the Government solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries and concerns must be addressed to Sam Varner either via fax at 530-276-2065, or e-mail at svarner@mp.usbr.gov.  At a minimum, responses must include the firm's name, contact information, business size in accordance with the size standard for NAICS code 511210, and concise description of similar items to the requirement described above.

<SUBJECT>A -- LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS TO LICENSEE TO COMMERCIALIZE TECHNOLOGY FOR CYLINDRICAL MICROLENSES
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS TO LICENSEE TO COMMERCIALIZE TECHNOLOGY FOR CYLINDRICAL MICROLENSES

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), IS seeking licensees to commercialize its technology to make Cylindrical Microlenses.

Researchers at LLNL have developed a Cylindrical Microlenses.  The method for making the microlens permits the production of a Cylindrical Microlense that has almost any shape on its optical surfaces, such as elliptical or hyperbolic.  In order to manufacture the microlense, the desired shape is first formed in a glass preform.  Then, the preform is heated to the minimum drawing temperature and a fiber is drawn from it.  The cross-sectional shape of the fiber bears a direct relation to the shape of the preform from which it was drawn.  During the drawing process, the surfaces become optically smooth from fire polishing.

The microlenses can transform an input light distribution into some desired output light distribution.  The microlenses are particularly useful when connected to a laser diode bar.  The microlenses can collimate the laser radiation emitted from the laser diode, which makes the laser diodes more useful for direct use or for pumping a high average power solid state lasers.   While particularly useful for laser diodes, the microlenses can also find use in any application which requires relatively inexpensive optics to condition and focus light output from an input source.

The technology regarding Cylindrical Microlenses is covered by U.S. Patents #5080706,  #5081639, #5155631, and # 5181224, which are assigned to the University of California and are available for non-exclusive licensing.

LLNL also has an additional lens technology covered by U.S. Patent # 6,710,926.   This patent covers a cylindrical microlens which has an internally reflective surface and can reflect light at an angle normal to the plane of a laser diode array.  This intellectual property is also available for licensing on a non-exclusive basis.

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's Cylindrical Microlenses should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.

Written responses should be directed to:

<SUBJECT>--Fuel Handlers Coverall
<DESC>The Product Manager- Clothing and Individual Equipment (PM-CIE) at the Soldier and Biological Chemical Command, Natick, MA is conducting a market investigation to identify domestic products, suppliers and manufacturers of a Fuel Handlers Coverall (F HC).  The coverall shall be a one piece commercial off the shelf (COTS) system that will not require additional research and development.  The FHC will be safe to operate, store, and maintain in its intended environment throughout its life cycle with the f ollowing capabilities being mission critical: (1) There shall be no fuel penetration for 12 hours following direct contact with fuel; no fuel penetration when in direct contact with 1 foot of fuel for one hour.  (2) The FHC must not generate or hold a char ge sufficient to ignite military fuels.  (3) The garment shall provide heat stress management that is equal to or better than the current rubberized wet weather gear.  In addition to these requirements the FHC shall have the same or better flame retardant and fire resistant characteristics as the fuel handlers gloves. The FHC shall not damage equipment, be a source of static electricity or present a shock hazard to warfighters who must work in close contact with computers, or exposed wiring and circuitry. The material fibers of the FHC shall resist degradation by POL products JP4, JP5, JP8, DFA, DF1, DF2, DFM, MOGAS, JET-A, and JET-A1 and all other class III package products over a 120 day wear period for 12 hours a day.  There shall also be no degradation in physical surface appearance or performance after 20 wash/dry cycles. The FHC shall be capable of being worn by a warfighter in any terrain type and climatic condition (Basic and Hot). The FHC shall be capable of maintaining POL protection over the opera tional temperature range of -25°F to 120°F.  In addition there shall be no water penetration when exposed to rain, and no degradation of the performance of the FHC when saturated with water.  The FHC must be sized and adjustable to fit the central 90% Sold ier (5 % female to 95 % male); A sufficient number of sizes of the FHC must be provided to correctly fit the full range of body sizes of the target audience. The FHC shall be subdued in color and commensurate with current operational uniforms.  The FHC sha ll be compatible with all currently fielded and developmental Fuel Handlers clothing and individual equipment (CIE), specifically the Extended Cold Weather Clothing System (ECWCS).  The FHC shall have a don/doff time of 5 minutes with a doffing time of 15 minutes if saturated with fuel.  The FHC shall not require any special logistical considerations, being supported by the standard Army logistical support system and maintained by user personnel in existing TOE and TDA organizations.  The maintenance instru ctions shall be published in an instruction sheet with each pair of coveralls that if possible, can be sewn to the inside of the coveralls.  Packaging will facilitate shelf life by preventing FHC from being adversely affected by prolonged storage under any  climatic conditions (e.g. precipitation, salt spray, UV, hot/dry, or temperature/ humidity cycling) or exposure to substances such as CB agents, POLs, flight line chemicals, etc.  Storage may be in outside areas and non-climatically controlled facilities with temperatures ranging from -40 up to 160 degrees F (IAW AR 70-38). Packaging must be designed to ensure a shelf life of the fuel handlers coverall at least 5 years.  Because the reduction of health hazard factors contributes to overall soldier health,  the hazards associated with toxic or allergenic materials, combustion products, or heat stress from wearing the FHC must be identified and reduced through design and selection of materials.  The FHC shall comply with applicable safety requirements and pre sent no uncontrolled safety hazards throughout their lifecycle.  All health hazards associated with the storage, use, and disposal shall be eliminated or reduce d to acceptable levels.  The FHC shall be constructed of non-toxic (to skin contact, open wound and inhalation if burned) materials that do not promote mold and fungus growth.  Manufactures of the FHC shall not be in legal/ regulatory conflict with safety/ health, air/water pollution, and hazardous waste requirements. Interested firms are requested to submit information on their product(s) within thirty (30) days following the publication of this synopsis. Interested sources shall include information detailed in the CBD Note 25 regarding a firms experience, personnel, and facilities. Information should include, but not limited too, product cost, technical information (e. g. physical properties, performance characteristics, test methodology (e.g. ASTM, UL), certification/compliance (NFPA, ANSI/OSHA), material identificat ion, and MSDS), illustrations and designs, color availability, warranty terms, relevant company background/experience, ISO 9001 certification or equivalent to ISO 9001, and any other information that the company believes demonstrates the value of their pro duct(s) and ability to meet the requirements. Companies are also encouraged to submit samples for evaluation. Any information/samples submitted will not be returned, and no payment will be made by the Government for such samples.

Statement of Work for – Organizing, Conducting, and Further Developing the Interagency Trade Officer Training Program Background The Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee (TPCC) is an interagency task force, chaired by the Department of Commerce.  It was created in 1992 to coordinate the export promotion and export finance activities of the U.S. Government.  One of the chief duties of the TPCC is to ensure better delivery of services to U.S. businesses.  The TPCC’s 2002 National Export Strategy Report to Congress called on the trade promotion agencies to develop a training program to improve customer service by strengthening interagency cooperation and client management.  Research indicated that customer service would improve if trade promotion staff in each agency had a more sophisticated understanding of the programs of other agencies and how they interrelate.  In 2003, the TPCC responded with the pilot Interagency Trade Officer Training Program.  Three sessions were conducted with the full-time support of a senior officer of the Commercial Service (on temporary assignment to the TPCC) and the services of a contractor.  In 2004, the TPCC retained a full-service contractor to further develop the program and organize and conduct three training sessions.   With very positive feedback and continued demand from participating agencies, the TPCC plans to continue this training initiative.  Work Description  The TPCC is seeking proposals for the organization, conduct and ongoing development of the training program.  The period of performance is 12 months with two additional 12 month option periods.  Within 12 months there shall be three training sessions conducted by the contractor.  The duration of each session is approximately four days.   In 2005, the three sessions shall be conducted sometime in March/April (first session), May/June (second session), and September (third session).  Specific dates have yet to be set.  The purpose of this work is to prepare the next generation of international trade officers to accurately and holistically gauge their customers’ real needs in relation to the full array of federal export promotion programs and services available.  Course content must give participants a clear understanding of:  Impact of the competitive business environment on the customer service needs of U.S. companies (particularly small and medium-sized enterprises) 1. Best practices government can apply to create higher customer value across agencies; 2.  Trade promotion counseling and marketing programs across the federal government;   3.  Federal information and IT resources available to U.S. businesses;  4. Trade finance issues and federal trade finance services and solutions;  5. Advocacy, market access and trade compliance services of the federal government;  6.  Other government programs that impact U.S. exporters and their competitiveness (e.g., export controls).  Deliverables   In order to achieve the desired level of interagency staff expertise and understanding, this work requires the following deliverables:  1.  Developing a four-day curriculum based on the course content above no later than three weeks after award.  2.  Recruiting and scheduling qualified presenters from throughout government and the private sector.  3.  Coaching presenters from each agency to address TPCC themes, e.g., clean hand-offs/referrals of clients between agencies, strategic coordination between agencies.  4.  Preparation of briefing books and course material CDs for each participant (30-40 per session, 90-120 per year).  5.  Development of multiple interactive exercises, including at least two real-world case studies that bring in U.S. company representatives to work with break out groups (2-4 business reps per session).  6.  Comprehensive evaluation/review of the program with the participants, including full feedback reports to the TPCC no later than one week after conclusion of each session.  7.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES

BACKGROUND 

The U.S. Coast Guard currently operates twenty HU-25 aircraft manufactured between 1982 and 1984 by Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA-Avions Marcel.  Three of the items listed in this requirement manufactured by Dassault Equipements Div De Dassault Aviation, Paris, France, currently installed on these aircraft are serial number tracked under the Coast Guard’s Aviation Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS).  This tracking provides, but is not limited to: an individual components historical record of repair or overhaul; tracking of component time (time since new (TSN)/time in service (TIS), time since overhaul (TSO), and mean time between failure (MTBF); component status; and physical location.  ALL ITEMS IN THIS REQUIREMENT ARE DESIGNATED “FLIGHT CRITICAL”.

OBJECTIVE

The Coast Guard’s objective is to obtain services of a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) authorized repair center to effectively repair/overhaul these items for return to service, at the best value to the Government.  Repaired/Overhauled items must meet the Original Equipment Manufacturer’s (OEM) operational specifications in accordance with the applicable Component Maintenance Manual (CMM) as specified in the list of items stated above.  

The offeror is responsible for all necessary functions to perform services requested.  This includes, but is not limited to: trained personnel, required tooling, calibrated test equipment, CMM, OEM approved replacement parts, preservation and shipping.

The offeror’s responsibilities to Coast Guard ACMS consist of ensuring that the significant component history corresponds with the component, and that all OEM service bulletins remain incorporated upon completion of work.

Under a performance-based contract structure, performance metrics and service level agreements will be used to monitor the performance of this contract.  The Coast Guard Aircraft Repair and Supply Center’s (ARSC) HU-25 Product Line and the chosen offeror will baseline and monitor progress using agreed-to performance metrics and service level agreements.  



To meet the Coast Guard’s objectives, the offeror will be required to meet the following criteria: 

1.	Technical:

a.	Provide detailed work specifications for repair of items to return to service.

b.	Provide a written Performance Metrics plan.  

c.	Provide evidence of an ability to maintain a Quality System acceptable to the Coast Guard.

d.	Possess or show ability to obtain adequate technical data, tooling, calibrated test equipment and fixtures  to meet the OEM current specifications.

e.	Provide an incentive proposal. 

f.	Provide repercussions for failure to meet Turn-Around-Time (TAT).

2.	Past Performance:
a.	Provide documentation for having performed repair/overhaul of similar or like 
	items.

b.	Provide points of contact for past performance documentation for the past two years.  Include reference’s name, company, phone number, and e-mail address.

3.	Pricing:

Provide a firm-fixed price for repair of the part numbers listed above for ALL years including both Level I and Level II Repairs.  

A separate cost breakdown for parts and labor (shall include an hourly labor rate) will be required for both Level I Repair and Level II Repair.  At a minimum, these two levels of service should be addressed in offeror’s technical and cost proposal.  Offerors may propose additional levels of service.

4.	Definitions:

a.	Turn around Time (TAT):  Turn around time is defined as the time item is received at vendor’s facility until item is returned to ARSC or designated Air Station.
 

b.	Premature Failures:  Premature failures are identified as those failures which occur during testing prior to installation or within the first 250 hours of operation.  Note:  Premature failures found to be “No Fault Found” will not be considered in the premature failure clause.

c.	Level I Repair:  Test/inspect/repair as necessary.  This work consists of inspection, failure analysis, defective part(s) replacement if necessary, and testing to meet the OEM’s functional return to service requirements.

d.	Level II Repair (Overhaul):  Over and above a Level I Repair for units showing excessive degradation.  A Level II Repair zeros the components’ time since overhaul.

APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS 

Component Maintenance Manuals references as listed in the Schedule of Services/Supplies.  

If the offeror proposes to use technical information (manuals, service bulletins, specifications, etc.) other than that specified in the solicitation to repair/overhaul these components, he shall provide a list with his quote.  All documents should be listed with basic and revision dates along with the source for this information.

PREMATURE FAILURES

Those items identified as premature failures will be sent back to the vendor on a “no cost” order.  Upon evaluation, the vendor will:  (1)  Repair the unit at no cost to the government OR
(2)  Submit justification, within 10 working days, to the Contracting Officer as to why the unit is not considered a premature failure.  If the Contracting Officer agrees with the vendor’s finding, the order will be modified to fund for repairs.

BEYOND ECONOMICAL REPAIR

In the event the contractor considers an item listed in the contract to be beyond economical  repair, he shall contact the Contracting Officer, in writing, for disposition instructions.  The notification shall identify the delivery order number, item number, part number, serial number, and a breakdown of the price for parts and labor necessary to repair the component.  Contractor shall not proceed with repair or return to ARSC until instructions are received from the Contracting Officer.  Items that are determined to be BER/Scrap by both the contractor and the Contracting Officer will be returned to ARSC for disposition.  

DATA AVAILABILITY
OEM manuals, Service Bulletins and specifications are proprietary and cannot be furnished by the Coast Guard.  
Coast Guard specific Coast Guard Technical Orders (CGTO), and Time Compliance Technical Orders (TCTO) can be acquired through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This requirement will be satisfied using commercial acquisition procedures specified in FAR Part 12.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; firm-fixed-price proposals for overhaul of the following items are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number HSCG38-05-Q-30009 is being  assigned to this procurement for tracking purposes only and this synopsis/solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The incorporated clauses and provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-27.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 336413 and the size standard is 1000 employees. This synopsis/solicitation is issued for the overhaul of  Nose Landing Gear Struts,  NSN 1620-00-505-1184, P/N 3303591-3.  The quantity is 7. Overhauls shall be accomplished in accordance with Air Force Technical Order 4S2-23-3,4, (latest revision). The United States Coast Guard cannot supply Air Force Technical Orders. The contractor must have access to all applicable technical orders and is responsible for obtaining the technical order.  The source for this technical order is OO-ALC/TIED, Hill AFB, UT 84056-5820.  This document contains technical data whose export is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act. To obtain the necessary technical orders, contractors must first be registered as a certified U.S. Contractor with the Defense Logistics Support Center, (DLSC). Contractors desiring certifications must submit DD Form 2345, “Export Controlled DOD Technical Data Agreement” to DLSC.  Questions may be referred to DLSC at 1-800-352-3572.  Approved DD Forms 2345 must then be forwarded with the contractor’s request for the specified technical orders to (TO maintenance agency). Contract award for this requirement will not be delayed pending contractor registration for documents. The Coast Guard does not maintain nor release these documents. Overhaul pricing shall include all replacement parts.  The only exceptions are the Piston, part number 388028-19, NSN 1620-01-423-3708, and the Cylinder, part number 3303589-5, NSN 1620-01-452-7625.  These two items shall be priced separately for replacement cost if either one is determined to be beyond economical repair during the overhaul process. Contractors shall also propose a firm-fixed price for scrapping reparable assemblies that are determined to be beyond economical repair during the overhaul process. Non-reworkable items replaced during the overhaul shall be disposed of as scrap, which means to render those items unusable for their intended purpose.  Should any of the reparable assemblies be determined to be beyond economical repair, the contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer and await disposition instructions.  The contractor shall be entitled to the flat scrap rate charge specified in the award document.  The United States Coast Guard will not provide Government Furnished Material for this requirement.  Offerors must possess a current FAA certification or an OEM certification to perform overhaul and service on the items listed above and must provide proof of these certifications with the proposal; or other certifications; (such as DOD Certification), to be submitted to the Contracting Officer for review and approval on a case by case basis. Components specified for rework/overhaul  are serial number tracked by the Coast Guard’s Aviation Computerized Maintenance System, (ACMS).  The contractor shall maintain a legible component tracking form for each item reworked or overhauled.  A copy of the tracking form shall be provided  by request or upon award of the requirement.  Firm-fixed prices do not include components received that indicate obvious misuse, cannibalization, or severe damage due to mishandling or crash damage.  Components received in the above listed conditions will be handled on a case by case basis, after notification to the Contracting Officer of such condition.  Within fifteen days of the determination, the Contractor shall submit a condition report for Unusually Damaged Items listing parts and labor required to accomplish the "over and above work".  The contractor shall be entitled to the firm-fixed-price specified in the contract for overhaul and any amounts proposed for "over and aboves" will be negotiated separately.  High cost replacement parts and/or the presence of corrosion that does not exceed the tolerances stated in the overhaul directive, will NOT be considered as reasons for "over and above" proposals and will not necessitate re-negotiation of the overhaul prices. Offerors' proposals are to include a delivery schedule.  Desired delivery to commence within 30 days after receipt of material.  Required delivery date is 20 January, 2005. Accordingly, the contractor will be required to notify the Contracting Officer upon receipt of the reparables.  Earlier deliveries are acceptable and desired at no additional cost to the Coast Guard.  Inspection and acceptance shall be performed by USCG ARSC Quality Assurance Personnel. Fob point shall be destination. Copies of packing slips shall be affixed to the outside of the shipping container.  Packaging of the items for return shipment shall be in accordance with the Contractor's best commercial practices with the following exceptions:  Each item or unit must be individually packed in a separate box, carton, or crate.  Each individual container shall be labeled on the outside with NSN , Part Number, Serial Number, Quantity, Nomenclature, Purchase Order Number, and Line Item.  Only Bar Coding of the NSN is necessary.  The internal packaging material shall be sufficient to prevent damage during shipment, handling, and storage.  Each unit shall be packaged to protect against electrostatic damage.  Preservation protection must be sufficient to prevent corrosion, deterioration or decay during warehouse storage for a period of one year, but no preservation coating will be applied directly to the component.  Packaging material shall NOT consist of the following material:  popcorn, shredded paper, styrofoam  of any type, or peanut style packaging.  The contractor shall review all manufacturers' service bulletins, service information letters and equipment revisions for applicability against the reworked item's part number.

The Government is anticipating a firm fixed price award for this solicitation. Statement of Work for – Organizing, Conducting, and Further Developing the Interagency Trade Officer Training Program Background The Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee (TPCC) is an interagency task force, chaired by the Department of Commerce.  It was created in 1992 to coordinate the export promotion and export finance activities of the U.S. Government.  One of the chief duties of the TPCC is to ensure better delivery of services to U.S. businesses.  The TPCC’s 2002 National Export Strategy Report to Congress called on the trade promotion agencies to develop a training program to improve customer service by strengthening interagency cooperation and client management.  Research indicated that customer service would improve if trade promotion staff in each agency had a more sophisticated understanding of the programs of other agencies and how they interrelate.  In 2003, the TPCC responded with the pilot Interagency Trade Officer Training Program.  Three sessions were conducted with the full-time support of a senior officer of the Commercial Service (on temporary assignment to the TPCC) and the services of a contractor.  In 2004, the TPCC retained a full-service contractor to further develop the program and organize and conduct three training sessions.   With very positive feedback and continued demand from participating agencies, the TPCC plans to continue this training initiative.  Work Description  The TPCC is seeking proposals for the organization, conduct and ongoing development of the training program.  The period of performance is 12 months with two additional 12 month option periods.  Within 12 months there shall be three training sessions conducted by the contractor.  The duration of each session is approximately four days.   In 2005, the three sessions shall be conducted sometime in March/April (first session), May/June (second session), and September (third session).  Specific dates have yet to be set.  The purpose of this work is to prepare the next generation of international trade officers to accurately and holistically gauge their customers’ real needs in relation to the full array of federal export promotion programs and services available.  Course content must give participants a clear understanding of:  Impact of the competitive business environment on the customer service needs of U.S. companies (particularly small and medium-sized enterprises) 1. Best practices government can apply to create higher customer value across agencies; 2.  Trade promotion counseling and marketing programs across the federal government;   3.  Federal information and IT resources available to U.S. businesses;  4. Trade finance issues and federal trade finance services and solutions;  5. Advocacy, market access and trade compliance services of the federal government;  6.  Other government programs that impact U.S. exporters and their competitiveness (e.g., export controls).  Deliverables   In order to achieve the desired level of interagency staff expertise and understanding, this work requires the following deliverables:  1.  Developing a four-day curriculum based on the course content above no later than three weeks after award.  2.  Recruiting and scheduling qualified presenters from throughout government and the private sector.  3.  Coaching presenters from each agency to address TPCC themes, e.g., clean hand-offs/referrals of clients between agencies, strategic coordination between agencies.  4.  Preparation of briefing books and course material CDs for each participant (30-40 per session, 90-120 per year).  5.  Development of multiple interactive exercises, including at least two real-world case studies that bring in U.S. company representatives to work with break out groups (2-4 business reps per session).  6.  Comprehensive evaluation/review of the program with the participants, including full feedback reports to the TPCC no later than one week after conclusion of each session.  7.

<DESC>"CONTINUED FROM COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION"
The following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Homeland Security Acquisition Regulation (HSAR), Provisions and Clauses apply:

FAR 52.212-1  Instructions to Offerors – Commercial Items (Jan 2005)

FAR 52.212-2  Evaluation – Commercial Items (Jan 1999) 
Award will be made utilizing the following factors, in descending order of importance:  The Coast Guard intends to award to the Contractor whose proposal is identified as offering the best value solution.
§	The Source Selection Team (SST) may determine the best value for the Coast Guard merits a higher price based on technical superiority.  The SST, using sound business judgment, will base the selection decision on an integrated assessment of the proposal’s relative capability as measured against the below evaluation factors:
o	Factor 1 –Technical/Management Solution/Approach
o	Factor 2 – Performance Measures and Metrics
o	Factor 3 – Past Performance
o	Factor 4 – Cost/Price

Factor 1 and Factor 2 are equal and each is significantly more important than Factor 3.  While the Cost/Price is an important part of the integrated selection decision, the non-Cost/price factors are significantly more important than the Cost/Price factor.

Cost/price will become increasingly important as proposal evaluation ratings for technical factors approach equal.

DETAILED FACTORS

Factor 1:  Technical Management/Solution/Approach

The technical/management solution/approach will be evaluated for its quality and evidence of extent to which Contractor’s solutions will achieve Coast Guard objectives of repair.  The evaluation will include an assessment that the solution adheres to sound engineering, design and management practices and that the Contractor has a complete understanding of the objectives, constraints and is customer focused.  Evidence of the quality of the technical management/solution/approach includes:

(a)	A comprehensive performance work statement and contract breakdown structure that identifies the services to be delivered to meet the program and mission requirements set forth in the statement of objectives.

(b)	A sound technical proposal that clearly demonstrates how implementation of the proposed solutions will deliver timely, stable, reliable, secure, flexible, responsive, compliant and cost effective services.

(c)	A sound partnering approach to management that demonstrates the ability to aggressively identify and apply information technology solutions to business processes.  The management approach needs to provide:

§	Highly qualified and experienced key personnel with a proven track record of success in providing large enterprise-wide managed services under performance based arrangements.
§	Clear lines of communication between the Contractor’s team and the Coast Guard for timely problem identification, mitigation and resolution.
§	Active and continuing participation and involvement of senior corporate executives in ensuring the success of this program.

(d)	The Contractor’s validated process and procedures that ensure high quality performance (i.e., ISO 9000 type or other quality certifications).

Factor 2:  Performance Measures and Metrics

The offered performance metrics and service level agreements will be evaluated for the extent they are:

(a)	Comprehensive in their ability to quantify, measure, track, and report operational performance relating to both system and management performance as well as achievement of Coast Guard objectives,
(b)	Identifying the highest level of service consistent with cost effectiveness, such as Mean Time Between Failure
(c)	Tied to performance incentives and disincentives that are directly related to meeting or exceeding mission critical performance metrics.

Factor 3:  Past Performance

The past performance evaluation will examine how the Contractor’s past and present performance validates expected performance and customer satisfaction.  The Coast Guard may use data obtained from other sources to conduct the past performance assessment, as well as that provided in the proposal.

The past performance evaluation will also examine the Contractor’s actual performance on repair/overhaul of similar or like items.  This review will focus on the scope and complexity of the efforts, the performance measures’ service levels applied, and the actual results achieved against those measures.

Factor 4:  Cost/Price

Each Contractor’s cost/price proposal will be evaluated based on the following:

(a)	Evaluation of proposed price/cost

(b)	Reasonableness:  Reasonableness will be established by the existence of adequate price competition and by comparing all, or a representative sample of the proposed prices/costs to industry average rates and/or rates from other contracts for similar work, etc.

(c)	Realism:  A realism assessment will be accomplished by technical review and evaluation of the skill mix, specific hours, and material kinds and quantity for each identified CLIN/SubCLIN in the Contractor’s proposed cost/price proposal.  The intent of the evaluation is to determine whether the estimated proposed price/cost elements are realistic for the work to be performed; reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and are consistent with the approach described in the Contractor’s technical proposal.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

"Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

"Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- 

(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 

“Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 

(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

<DESC>WORK STATEMENT

“Technical Assistance” for Advisory and Assistance Services by Non-Governmental Sources for Azerbaijan”

Project Title:  Azerbaijan:  Technical Assistance:  Contractor Selection for Strategic Restructuring of Ministry of Communications and Information Technologies TA


1		Scope of Work

The Contractor shall perform the following tasks:

(1) Develop detailed selection procedures for the selection committee based on the criteria specified in the Request for Proposals for the Strategic Restructuring of Ministry of Communications and Information Technologies Project and the host country’s procedures for competitive selection; (2) travel to Baku, Azerbaijan with the proposals submitted by U.S. companies for the study.  The proposals will be delivered unopened to the Grantee in the sealed package provided by USTDA; (3) participate in the study selection process as an observer; and (4) prepare a final report to USTDA on the selection process.

It is the responsibility of the Contractor to verify with the COTR that the report is considered acceptable and ready for the production of the appropriate number of copies.  All reports must be paginated.  All reports must be submitted on a 3.5 inch disk in Microsoft Word.

In connection with travel, USTDA will advise the U.S. Embassy in Baku, Azerbaijan of the Contractor’s proposed travel itinerary prior to departure.  The Contractor should contact the U.S. Embassy upon arrival and prior to departure to brief and debrief them on the visit.   USTDA will request that the Embassy provide the Contractor with names and addresses of appropriate host country officials with whom to meet. Logistics for handling the visit, including hotel accommodations, transportation and translation services are also the responsibility of the Contractor.

2  		Delivery & Performance Requirements

2.1		Kick-Off Meeting with the USTDA Program Office

Upon award, the Contractor shall contact USTDA’s Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) to schedule a meeting to discuss details of the Contract assignment.  Unless otherwise advised by the COTR, this meeting will be held at USTDA’s office in Arlington, Virginia. The COTR shall provide the Contractor with names and addresses of the project sponsor(s), other pertinent entities to contact in the United States and overseas, and any other relevant details that may impact upon the design and/or evaluation of the proposed project(s).  

2.2		Pre-Visit Report

Prior to departure to the host country, the Contractor shall provide the COTR a pre-visit written report of 3-5 pages containing the proposed schedule or itinerary, a list of contacts to be made during the visit and a pre-visit checklist of issues, information and questions to be utilized during the visit, and the proposed evaluation criteria for the selection committee.  

2.3		USTDA Responsibility

USTDA will advise the U.S. Embassy in the host country of the Contractor’s proposed travel itinerary prior to departure and request that the Economic Section of the Embassy provide the Contractor with names and addresses of appropriate host country officials with whom to meet.

2.4		Contractor’s Host Country Travel 

The Contractor shall travel to the host country to meet with relevant project officials and with the U.S. Embassy.  The Contractor shall contact the Economics Officer at the U.S. Embassy upon arrival and prior to departure for briefing and debriefing meetings.   While the Embassy may be able to assist the Contractor in arranging some initial meetings with host country officials, the Contractor is responsible for arranging the meetings as well as logistics for the visit, i.e., hotel accommodations, transportation, and interpretation services. In some cases, the Contractor may need to Contract with a local entity to assist with these logistics.  

3		Contractor Interim Status Reporting and Deliverables

The Contractor shall provide verbal updates to the COTR when necessary. The deliverables may also take the form of information, advice, opinions, alternatives, analyses, evaluations, recommendations, interim and final reports, or other oral or written work products needed for successful performance.

4.1		Report Draft  -- COTR Approval 

The Contractor shall provide the report in draft form to USTDA for COTR review within ten (10) working days after completion of the overseas visit. The report should be clearly marked “Draft” on the cover.

4.2		Revised Report Draft – COTR Approval

Within five (5) working days after receiving the COTR’s comments on the draft report, the Contractor shall submit a revised copy for COTR review.  The Contractor shall revise the report as necessary until securing final COTR approval.  




4.3		Final Report – COTR Approval

The final report shall incorporate all mutually agreed upon material and revisions.   The report shall include any supporting documentation.  It shall be grammatically and factually correct in all respects, internally consistent, and all statements and tables shall be clear and easily understood by a competent reader, and contain no typographical errors.  Upon notification from the COTR that the report is considered acceptable, the Contractor shall submit twenty (20) copies, and one (1) unbound original to USTDA. All reports must be paginated and submitted in Microsoft Word on a 3.5-inch disk or on a CD-Rom.  The Contractor shall also submit the report to the COTR as an e-mail attachment, and also in Microsoft Word format.

5. 		Project Descriptions and Profile

The Azeri Ministry of Communications and Information Technologies has requested USTDA’s assistance with the strategic and organizational restructuring of Azerbaijan’s newly created Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (MCIT).  This assistance will help the newly created ministry define the roles and functions of this body, as well as define the transitional tasks necessary to manage the financial, legal, and strategic elements of Azerbaijan’s ICT framework.  While the project is expected to attract many interested U.S. firms, the Ministry is relatively inexperienced with administering a competitive selection, and it is necessary to provide technical assistance in undertaking this process.   U.S. firms will submit proposals for the Technical Assistance on Strategic Restructuring of Ministry of Communications and Information Technologies in Azerbaijan.  

This RFP concerns assisting the Ministry in choosing a contractor for the Strategic Restructuring of the Ministry of Communications and Information Technologies Technical Assistance project.

In February of 2004, the President of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, announced his intention to liquidate the Ministry of Communications and form the MCIT.  The new MCIT is intended to have a purely regulatory function, rather than have responsibility for the commercial communications sector in Azerbaijan as the Ministry of Communications formerly did.  The move is seen as positive, as it will likely increase market-oriented reforms in Azerbaijan and could open up the sector to more private sector participation.  It is especially important as it moves Azerbaijan closer towards commitments in the telecommunications sector regarding WTO accession.  

The implementation of appropriate legal and regulatory reforms will assist Azerbaijan in establishing a more market-friendly environment in which to do business, especially in the telecom sector.  Azerbaijan’s extensive dependence on oil and gas-related activities to generate GDP is what helps to generate a strong Information and Communications Technology (ICT) market as more and more oil companies are establishing offices, communications networks, and broadband connections.  This surge in Azerbaijan’s wealth is creating enormous opportunities and demands in the market for complete telecommunications solutions.  However, until Azerbaijan takes decisive steps in reforming the legal and regulatory framework and management structure responsible for transparent telecom operations, limitations will remain and hinder the commercial and developmental growth of the ICT sector.

The technical assistance will specifically help the Minister and his management team in accomplishing the transitional tasks necessary to lead the new MCIT.  This will include advisory services related to technology transfer, restructuring, and organizational management.  The working level assistance will enhance the new ministry’s understanding of modern practices in the ICT sector and help identify and outline a timeline for the implementation of new institutional relationships with which to improve national policy making.  The TA also includes assistance with issues related to regulation, licensing, interconnection, tariff management, and enforcement of ICT sector rules and regulations.
