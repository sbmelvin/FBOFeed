<p>Offerors should monitor the Federal Business Opportunities website at http://www.fbo.gov in the event this announcement is amended.<br /> <br />CONCISE SUMMARY OF TECHNOLOGY REQUIREMENT:  AFRL Information Directorate's Autonomy Command &amp; Control Core Technical Competency (AC2 CTC) is seeking innovative approaches to the overall goal of Mastering the Complexity of Commanding and Controlling Multi-Domain operations.  This goal has two distinct parts.  The first is reducing the complexity that airmen must endure as a result of the myriad of complex systems of systems used in order to create multi-domain plans and subsequent orders.  The desired effect of this reduction in complexity is the reduction of uncertainty in planning operations and an associated increase in operations ops tempo.  The second part of this goal is the imposition of complexity on an adversary that comes with developing synchronized and orchestrated effects through the use of assets from multiple domains.  For this BAA we will focus on the operational domains of air, space and cyberspace, but will consider innovative approaches that may include land and maritime.  A major class of approaches to this management of complexity will involve the use of machine learning algorithms.</p>
<p>BAA ESTIMATED FUNDING:  Total funding for this BAA is approximately $9,999,999.00. Individual awards will not normally exceed 6 months with dollar amounts normally ranging from $300K to $500K.  There is also the potential to make awards up to any dollar value as long as the value does not exceed the available BAA ceiling amount.</p>

each  RFQ ("Brand Name or Equal", or "meet minimum stated specifications),
the information describing what you are offering must be physically written
into the seller's bid specification block. Salient characteristics are
defined as "pronounced features of an item that identify it describe its

commercial items in accordance with FAR 13.5.  Fedbid is NOT a forum for
filing protests against the Government.  Attempts to file protests through

requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  It is preferable
that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest
level possible before considering the more formal process described below.
The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to
seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute
Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government
Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or
performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within
the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal
is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely,
protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you
want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must
request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All
other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for
resolution.

<DESC>NO PHONE CALLS PLEASE.  ALL QUESTIONS MUST BE IN WRITING VIA EMAIL TO THE CONTRACTING OFFICER.  CONTACT INFORAMTION IS PROVIDED BELOW.

This is a market survey for the acquisition for SATCOM Satellite Communications subscription service for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).

National Airways Systems Engineering (AJW-3920) has a requirement for the Aeronautical Satellite Communications (SATCOM) subscription to support Hanger 6 Gulfstream G-IV aircraft N1, N2 and N3 for domestic and international missions for a one-year period from October 1, 2018 - September 30, 2109.

The SATCOM service provider must supply subscription for aeronautical satellite communications incorporating all required services to include:
-	 Inmarsat
-	 Iridium
-	 Ku-band
-	 Swift 64 Service (Generation 3)
-	 Classic Aero-H Service (Generation 3)
-	 classic Aero-H+ Service (Generation 4)

The communication equipment installed on the aircraft has specifically designed electronics that only allow for receipt of transmissions broadcast by SATCOMâ€™s satellite and land based equipment.   

The subscription service is specifically required for compatibility with the satellite communications equipment that is currently installed on the FAAâ€™s Gulfstream G-IV N1, N2 and N3, to support agency dignitary domestic and international missions. 

The installed aircraft communications system allows Wi-Fi and other enhanced communications capabilities required during flight transportation of the Department of Transportation Secretary, the FAA Administrator and other agency dignitaries.  

All aircraft components must be type certificated in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulation (14 CFR) procedures set for under Certification Parts 23, 25, 27 and 29 which states, â€œFor new, amended and supplemental type certificates (STC) under 14 CFR Parts 23, 25, 27 and 29, the cognizant FAA Aircraft Certification Officer (ACO) and the service provided will meet the FAAâ€™s requirement.â€  

The FAA intends to solicit and negotiate only with SATCOM Direct Communications, Incorporated, Baltimore, MD.  In accordance with AMS Policy 3.2.2.4., SATCOM Direct Communications, Inc is the only qualified source to meet the requirements for this subscription service.  It is anticipated that a firm-fixed priced type purchase order will be used to accommodate this subscription service.

The purpose of this survey is to solicit statements of interests and capabilities from all businesses that are interested and capable and providing the subscription for aeronautical satellite communications incorporating all required services identified above.

<DESC>U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Anchorage, AK has a requirement for a commercial item or service. This combined synopsis/solicitation is prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 (as supplemented with additional information included in this notice). This posting will be referred to under Request for Quotation (RFQ) Number 140F0718R0012. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. A written solicitation will be issued and attached to this posting for reference only. This RFQ falls under procedures in FAR Parts 12 and 13. This document incorporates provisions and clauses updated by way of the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) #05-99, effective Jun 16, 2018. This requirement is set aside for small businesses.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) number is 561920, Support Â¿ Management Logistics Support and the business size standard is $11M. This announcement constitutes the Government's only official notice of this procurement. The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this synopsis.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is requesting proposals to provide logistic support to facilitate a meeting concerning Â¿Preparing for the Future-Rethinking Conservation and AdaptationÂ¿ in accordance with the following:  
 
Background

As a concept, the Anthropocene integrates the consequences of climate change with other human activities that are pervasive, accelerating, and leading to a less biologically diverse and much warmer no-analogue future.  A gap is emerging between this unfolding reality and current conservation approaches which are rooted in the past and not keeping pace with the accelerating dynamics of a rapidly- changing world.  This gap was identified in 2017 by U.S. Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service Alaska Region (FWS-AK) as one of the highest priority challenges to its conservation objectives.  As a conservation paradigm, the Anthropocene embraces the perspective that we are part of nature and accepts the responsibility to steward the changes that protect the decision space for future generations.  In early 2018, the FWS-AK Directorate chartered an Anthropocene Working Group to explore changes in agency thinking and culture needed to meet the profound challenges that lie ahead.  On April 6, 2018, FWS-AK held the first of a series of workshops (Â¿Preparing for the FutureÂ¿ workshop) to achieve region-wide staff engagement in the development of effective conservation approaches to a rapidly changing environment.

The purpose of the first workshop was to bring collective focus to the problem that our current conservation approaches are not keeping pace with accelerating dynamics of a rapidly-changing world; to consider the potential of new approaches and frameworks for conservation work; and, to commit to the continued conversation about doing things differently.  The day's discussion demonstrated that there is a need and appetite for this conversation and participants recognized their individual responsibilities to become champions for the effort.  It was acknowledged that by delaying meaningful action, the Region risks failing in our conservation objectives and losing the initiative to steward our own land and resources as change proceeds around us.  Participants conceded that the Region's wealth of information, data, tools, and subject matter experts, authority to act over a large land base, and strong partnerships all prepare FWS-AK to meet the challenges ahead.  However, resistance to change, fear of making mistakes, discomfort with actively shaping the future, and lack of defined goals and objectives prevents us from adopting a proactive, action-oriented approach.  When asked what conservation in the Anthropocene might require of the Region, participants described an agency with clearly defined goals oriented to a larger context that is willing to objectively evaluate agency traditions and supports long-term thinking.

FWS-AK requires facilitator support services for three additional workshops to be held over the next year which will provide opportunities to stay involved in the discussion and to shape the future of conservation in the region.  Each workshop will be built around locally-relevant case studies that reflect the breadth of issues and potential management challenges we face, and will explore retrospective and prospective adaptation approaches and outcomes.  The purposes of these workshops are to enhance the understanding of the larger issue and the challenges we face, and to begin rethinking our solutions.  Each 2 Â¿ 2.5-day workshop will include a review of the situation with locally-specific data, and a discussion of solutions currently being considered, a review of other options and possible outcomes that may not have been considered.  Proposed case studies will draw from available data and experience on the Kenai, the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta and northern Alaska.  The audience for each workshop will be the staff located or working within the geographic area covered by the case studies.  Workshops should begin in the fall (October 2018) and conclude by end of April 2019.  These workshops will help participants coalesce around a common understanding of the challenges FWS-AK faces in achieving our stated conservation goals and objectives, and will empower staff to participate in the development of adaptive solutions. The workshop will result in improved individual and organizational performance and assist in achieving USFWS mission and performance goals.  Each workshop will have a 12 week planning period.

The desired outcomes are to:
Â¿	Enhance understanding of the global-scale threats we face, and the utility of the Anthropocene as a conceptual framework for understanding, communicating, and addressing tomorrow's realities.
Â¿	Acknowledge the mismatch between our conservation aspirations and the conservation approaches we currently employ.
Â¿	Recognize the importance of changing how we think about conservation given the challenges we face.
Â¿	Begin thinking about solutions from a systems perspective that that integrates all drivers of change, views humans as part of, rather than apart from, the system, and empowers us to steward the changes that occur.

All dates are subject to change contingent upon agreement by both Contractor and FWS-AK Staff.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for an Education Training Facility.
<p>MSFC will be negotiating with the U.S. Space and Rocket Center (USSRC) only&nbsp;for the continued use of the second floor of the USSRC Education Training Facility (ETF). This effort will procure 7,891 square feet of training space. The proposed contract with USSRC provides for the use of the second floor of the facility as well as the tools and furnishings necessary to conduct training and professional development activities for MSFC employees, contractors, and others. The day-to-day operating elements for the facility include maintenance, security, utilities, and janitorial services. Market research was not conducted because of an existing real estate agreement between USSRC and MSFC for the facility. With the investment the Government has made in the building and the real estate agreement, it is not plausible to rent or procure a different facility for MSFC's ongoing need.</p>
<p>The Government intends to acquire a commercial item/service using FAR Part 12.</p>
<p>Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications in writing to Renatta America at renatta.r.america@nasa.gov no later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 08/28/2018. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to procure transportation services for the NCI Director and other high-level staff members. The NCI Immediate Office of the Director owns a vehicle that is</p>
<p><br />specifically assigned and reserved for this purpose and needs a contracted driver to be available as necessary. The driver will need to be on-site and be available as described in the Scope below</p>

<p>FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (October 2014)</p>
<p>BASIS FOR AWARD:</p>
<p>Selection of an offeror for award will be based on an evaluation of proposals against five factors. The factors, in order of importance are: Technical Approach, Experience, Expertise of Staff, 4. Past Performance, and 5. Price. All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. However, cost/price may become a critical factor in source selection in the event that two or more offerors are determined to be essentially equal following the evaluation of all factors other than cost/price. The process described in FAR 15.101-1 may be employed, which permits the Government to make tradeoffs among cost or price and non-cost factors to consider award to other than the lowest price offer or other than the highest technically rated factor. The Government intends to make an award to the offeror whose proposals provide the best overall value to the Government.</p>
<p>The evaluation will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective Contractors in relation to the needs set forth in the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation. The merits of each proposal will be evaluated carefully. Each proposal must document the feasibility of successful implementation of the requirements of the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation. Offerors must submit information sufficient to evaluate their proposals based on the detailed factors listed below.</p>
<p>The Evaluation Process:</p>

<p>&bull; A list of three (3) contracts providing similar services for quantitation of circulating inflammation markers currently in process that are similar in nature to the solicitation.

Total Contract Value<br />5. Description of Requirement<br />6. Contracting Officer's Name and Telephone Number<br />7. Program Manager's Name and Telephone Number</p>
<p>Each quoter/offeror may be evaluated on their performance under existing and prior contracts for similar products or services. The Government is not required to contact all references provided by the quoter/offeror. Also, references other than those identified by the quoter/offeror may be contacted by the Government to obtain additional information that will be used in the evaluation of the quoter/offeror's organizational experience.</p>
<p>The Government may evaluate the offeror's past performance on organizational experience based on information obtained from references provided by the offeror, other relevant past performance on organizational experience information obtained from other sources known to the Government, and any information supplied by the offeror concerning problems encountered on the identified contracts and corrective action taken.</p>
<p>The Government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror. Performance risks are those associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance.</p>
<p>Additional Submission Instructions</p>
<p>The quote must be prepared in two SEPARATE volumes: Volume I - "Technical Volume" and Volume II - "Price/Business Volume". Each of these parts shall be separate and complete in itself so that the evaluation of one may be accomplished independently of the evaluation of the other. The Request for Quotation (RFQ) number should be included on the front cover of each volume.</p>
<p>Your quote must stipulate that it is predicated upon all the terms and conditions of this RFQ and signed by an official authorized to bind your organization. In addition, it must contain a statement to the effect that it is firm for a period of at least 60 days from the date of receipt thereof by the Government.</p>
<p>This RFQ does not commit the Government to pay any of the costs associated with the preparation and submission of your quote. In addition, the Contracting Officer is the only individual authorized to legally commit the Government to the expenditure of public funds in connection with this requirement. By submitting a quote in response to this solicitation, it is understood that your quote shall become a part of the official contract file.</p>
<p>Questions<br />Questions relating to this acquisition shall be submitted to Contracting Officer, William Neal, via email at william.neal@nih.gov no later than 3:00 PM EST on August 21, 2018.

<p>Evaluation and award will be conducted in accordance with the requirements of FAR 13.106. The Government does not anticipate requesting revisions to quotes, so Quoters should provide their best solution and price in response to the Solicitation. However, the Government reserves the right to request quote revisions that seek additional price discounts, provide revisions to the technical quote, or clarify aspects of the quote. In the event quote revisions are requested, the Government will not necessarily be seeking revisions from all Quoters.</p>
<p>The technical volume must not contain references to price; however, resource information, such as data concerning labor hours and categories, materials, etc., must be contained in the technical volume so that the Respondent's understanding of the scope of work may be evaluated. Quoters must provide clear responses, including objectives and outcomes, to each task addressing the work to be performed in the SOW. The technical volume must reflect a clear understanding of the nature of the work being undertaken. Quotes which merely offer to conduct a project in accordance with the Government's requirements will not be eligible for award.</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the Quoter's price for all items/services proposed. Quotations will be evaluated for reasonableness. For a price to be reasonable, it must represent a price to the Government that a prudent person would pay when consideration is given to prices in the market. Normally, price reasonableness is established through adequate price competition.</p>

<DESC>Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 9609 Medical Center Drive, Room 1E132, Bethesda, MD 20892, UNITED STATES
<p>Description</p>
<p>National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB) plans to procure on a sole source basis services to obtain expert information on specific aspects of fallout dosimetry that have not been extensively studied or published, namely the internal dose modeling, the review of past dose assessments, and the recommendations for future measurements following a fallout event from Jala Dose Assessment (Andre Bouville), 16401 Henry Drive, Gaithersburg MD 20877.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) using simplified acquisition procedures for commercial acquisitions. The North American Industry Classification System code is 541990 and the business size standard is $15.0 Million.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a severable firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>The period of performance is twelve (12) months from date of award.</p>
<p>It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.</p>
<p>In the event of widespread radioactive fallout from a nuclear detonation in the atmosphere, there is little expertise available in the U.S. workforce today to estimate realistic radiation doses received by the public through the exposure pathways that impact both urban and rural populations. In the last 30 years, methods research for fallout dosimetry has been prompted primarily by federal mandates to assess risks from Nevada nuclear weapons testing or for specific health risk studies of radioactive fallout (e.g., in Utah, the Marshall Islands, Kazakhstan, etc.). Those studies, which were conducted by NCI and brought together expertise from both the U.S. and Russia, have resulted in several dozens of important publications. However, many of the details of the methods that would enable dose and risk assessors today to adequately respond to a large-scale exposure to radioactive fallout are not published or easily available. Moreover, the expertise to complete the research and publish the method is at a critically low level, with all but one or two experts in the U.S. already retired.</p>
<p>The overarching objective of the NCI/DCEG/REB study is to complete all necessary components of a comprehensive fallout dosimetry method based on both U.S. and Russian experience and to publish it in the peer reviewed scientific literature in the form of a comprehensive unified methodology.</p>
<p>The objective of this contract is to obtain expert information on specific aspects of fallout dosimetry that have not been extensively studied or published, namely the internal dose modeling, the review of past dose assessments, and the recommendations for future measurements following a fallout event.</p>
<p>Contractor Requirements:</p>
<p>The Contractor shall:</p>
<p>1. Assist the NCI on dose assessment methods used to evaluate the radiation exposures resulting from U.S, Russian and French test and dose assessment models used to estimate the radiation doses due to inhalation and ingestion of radioactive materials, the Contractor shall determine from the literature and by expert judgment, the mathematical values of the parameters needed for the NCI to model the doses for each exposure pathway, the technical bases for those parameter values, and write these into a report for submission.</p>
<p>2. Plan and make a presentation and lead discussion with collaborators during biannual meetings on the models used to estimate the radiation doses due to the inhalation and ingestion of radioactive materials.</p>
<p>3. Participate in the preparation of a publication on the internal doses from fallout deposition from nuclear weapons tests.</p>
<p>4. Provide detailed comments on a draft publication on the estimation of fallout deposition and external doses from nuclear weapons tests that will be sent to the Contractor by the NCI technical point of contact.</p>
<p>5. Provide detailed comments on a report, to be sent to the Contractor by the NCI technical point of contact, on the recommendations for future measurements regarding a fallout event.</p>
<p>Jala Dose Assessment is uniquely qualified to perform this work because this will be a continuation of the previous work on award HHSN261201700703P: components of a comprehensive international-based dosimetry method for exposure to radioactive fallout from nuclear detonations on internal dose modeling, review of past dose assessments, and recommendations for future measurements. The proposed Contractor has contributed their unique knowledge and skills in developing dose assessment methodology to previous NCI studies of fallout exposure including those for Nevada, the Marshall Islands, Kazakhstan, and presently for the Trinity nuclear test. Because of the proposed Contractor's undisputable expertise in fallout research and their knowledge of the fallout activities that took place in both the U.S. and the former U.S.S.R, and their many-year experience in contributing dosimetry analyses of the type conducted by the NCI, the Contractor is uniquely qualified to provide the services requested in the framework of this contract.</p>
<p>This notice is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party, especially small business believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a proposal or quote. The response and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement. Responses must be received in the contracting office by 4:00 PM EST, on August 24, 2018. All responses and questions must be in writing and faxed 240-276-5399 or emailed to Ronette Collins, Contract Specialist via electronic mail at ronette.collins@nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted. In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have valid certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) through sam.gov. Reference: N02CP82645-73 on all correspondence.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) plans to solicit proposals from qualified organizations to conduct experiments to assess neural representations of stimulus-stimulus associations in the orbitofrontal cortex and related areas, how they are deployed to control behavior, and the importance of changes in these processes to addiction.  Current work in the lab has successfully modeled this in rodents.  Currently we need to contract services to understand if these models apply to human orbitofrontal cortex.
<p>The contractor will employ state-of-the-art functional MRI approaches to extract neurobiological correlates of stimulus-stimulus associative learning and the deployment of these representations to control behavior in awake, behaving humans. The experiments will require MVPA analyses combined with custom olfactory testing capabilities, which together will parallel single-unit recording work done at the NIDA Intramural Research Program.</p>
<p>NIDA anticipates the award of one fixed price contract for a period of performance of one year.    <br />The earliest NIDA will post the solicitation is 15 days from today. You will be able to access the solicitation through the FedBizOpps website (URL: http://www.fbo.gov). All information required for the submission of a proposal is contained in or accessible through the solicitation package. After NIDA issues the solicitation, responses are due in NIDA's Contracting Office within 14 days. NIDA will consider proposals submitted by any responsible offeror. This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.</p>
<p>Note 26. Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, you may identify to the Contracting Officer its interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>

<p>The proposed project consists of hydraulically dredging a portion of the Federal navigation project (FNP) at the mouth of the Saco River which includes an 8-foot deep entrance channel, and three 6-foot deep anchorages (below Mean Lower Low Water). Approximately 41,000 cubic yards (CY) of required dredging, with another 36,000 CY of 1-ft allowable over depth dredging would bring these areas back to their authorized dimensions. Sandy shoal material dredged from the mouth of the river will be pumped approximately 8,000 ft. north to Camp Ellis Beach. The work in this area will require significant coordination around the tide cycles.</p>
<p>Additionally a contract option to mechanically dredge a portion of the FNP's 8-foot deep channel, and 6-foot deep maneuvering basin at the city center of Saco is included. Approximately 22,000 CY of required, and another 13,000 CY of 1-ft allowable over depth of predominantly fine grain sand and silty shoal material will be completed by mechanical dredge and hauled 1.25 mile south to a previously used in-river placement site for disposal.</p>
<p>Dredging and disposal operations will be performed between November 15, 2018 and March 15, 2019 to meet environmental time of year (TOY) restrictions. In order to accomplish all dredging requirements within the specified dredging window the Government will include definitive responsibility criterion requiring the Contractor to demonstrate experience dredging at least a mean average of 28,000 cy in a 30-calendar day period via hydraulic dredge on at least one (1) project in a tidal-influence area in the last seven (7) years, and demonstrate successful completion of beach placement of sand material within an intertidal area within the last seven (7) years. Failure to meet these criterion will result in the low bidder being found not responsible, and award will be made to the next low bidder who is found to be responsive and responsible. The low bidder shall be asked to provide documentation of its ability to meet this definitive responsibility criterion via self-performance or acceptable business arrangement. Environmental coordination and permitting have been completed by the U.S. Army of Engineers, New England District.</p>
<p>This is not an invitation for bids at this time. The solicitation requirements and contract documents to include instructions for submission and the response date will be available on or about Aug 10, 2017 and will be available for downloading by accessing the Federal Business Opportunities website (http:/www.fbo.gov). Please note this solicitation will be UNRESTRICTED.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION
The Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Program Contracting Activity Central (PCAC) anticipates soliciting quotations and subsequently awarding a Firm-Fixed-Price contract for Monitoring and Imaging Systems for the VA Northern California Health Care System (VANCHCS).  Acquisition of these items is part of the initial outfitting and activation of the new Chico VA Clinic in Chico, CA.

DESCRIPTION
A contract is needed for the Chico VA Clinic for below listed brand name GE Healthcare equipment.

SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS/MANUFACTURERS CUTSHEETS
The contractor will be required to include manufacturer cut-sheets/specifications for items quoted.

**See attached STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)
**See attached BRAND NAME J&A


ADMINISTRATIVE
The solicitation will be issued as a  Request for Quote  (RFQ) conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Parts 12 and 13. The solicitation will be advertised as set-aside for VOSB.  The applicable NAICS code is 334510. Â  The solicitation will be issued on or about August 22, 2018 for approximately seven (7) calendar days.  Offerors will be required to submit their quotes electronically via email. 

Products that are purchased outside of our authorized distributor network on the gray market generate a number of concerns such as: counterfeit or adulterated devices, inadequate storage conditions, tracking issues in case of a recall, loss of warrantee, and most importantly patient safety.Â  In some instances unauthorized distributors procure products from an authorized distributor for resale. However, authorized distributors purchase products at list price, and the unauthorized distributors are reselling the product at a price point below list price, which raises questions about product sourcing.

The solicitation will include the requirement that responders provide an authorized distributor letter that states the responder is an authorized dealer/distributor of the OEM for the items being procured such that all product warranties and service and/or preventative maintenance agreements transfer to the VA and will be honored by the OEM or guarantees that the OEM gives authorization to the responder to fulfill all warranty, service, and/or preventative maintenance obligations for the equipment.  Vendors who are unable to supply proof of authorized dealer or distributorship will not be considered for award.

This notice is not a request for competitive offers.  Questions of a technical nature will not be answered as part of this notice; however, all general questions may be submitted in writing to the issuing office via email at jacquelyn.wise@va.gov AND michelle.rhodes@va.gov.   Telephone calls will not be accepted.  The VA reserves the right to use only Federal Business Opportunities (FBO), via the internet, to provide notification of any amendments to this notice and the subsequent issuance of the solicitation.  It is the contractor s responsibility to view FBO daily for any amendments to this notice and the subsequent issuance of the solicitation.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;<strong>Request for Information (RFI): </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>ARC-190 High Frequency (HF) Radio</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Upgrade or Replacement<br /><br /></strong></p>
<p align="left">The United States Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), Airborne Communication and Nuclear Command, Control and Communications (NC3), AFLCMC/WNYBB, Robins Air Force Base, GA, is conducting market research to identify parties having an interest in and the resources to provide market research information on upgrading or replacing the ARC-190 High Frequency (HF) radio currently flown on multiple aircraft in the DoD inventory.<br /><br /><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>PURPOSE/DESCRIPTION</strong></p>
<p align="left">Current Department of Defense (DoD) weapon systems are highly dependent on HF radios for over the horizon, also known as beyond line of sight communications, specific to global conventional and unconventional mission requirements. The DoD currently uses the ARC-190 radio for these missions on the following aircraft:. B-1, B-2, B-52, C-130, RC-135, C-17, C-5, E-8, F-15E, KC-10, KC-135, HH-60, VC-25.</p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) seeks to characterize the current state of research, development, and production of systems that aircrew can use for HF communications requirements. Additionally, the government is interested in the ability to modify current ARC-190 radios or other existing radios to address known obsolescence issues with the current ARC-190 system and impacts on the planned shut-down of the ARC-190 production line.</p>
<p>Backward compatibility with existing systems is a desired goal to improve implementation costs although significant Life Cycle Cost savings would allow consideration of higher development and procurement cost. Enabling commonality across all AF airborne HF radios is also considered a supporting goal.</p>
<p>The government is aggressively pursuing open, non-proprietary, standardized electrical &amp; physical interfaces, message sets, and message protocols for all subsystems and data buses used in their airborne communications suites. The contractor is strongly advised to use when possible commercial off-the-shelf components that currently offer component interface specifications available to the general public at no cost.<br /><br />See Attached Request for Information and Contractor Capability Survey for additional information.</p>

SOW   Gore Medical Surgical Grafts



Background

The VA New Jersey Health Care System, East Orange campus, Surgical Services needs to replenish their supply of Gore Medical surgical grafts to maintain a seamless approach to accessing critical add-on surgical supplies that are normally maintained at the VANJ through a Gore Medical consignment agreement. Gore recently announced that it will be pulling its consignment agreements as a business practice moving forward. 

This replenishment order will round out our inventory by increasing the sizes we normally use most. The Surgical Services group will be forthcoming with their intentions to either enter into a long-term contract with Gore Medical or look at alternatives.  These Gore Medical grafts are critical to patient care.


Objectives
The goal here is to stabilize the current inventory of Gore Medical surgical grafts by replenishing some of the more popular sizes we currently kept on consignment. This order was created by Logistics, working with the Gore Medical Rep as they pare down the consignment offerings. Maintaining a small inventory is recommended to provide for any issues that may arise soon, since the staff is well versed with Gore Medical products. 

Period of Performance

This is a Supply buy, FY 2018 request as the consignment agreement will be ending within two-three weeks.

Place of Performance / Place of Delivery

All items will be delivered through the normal warehouse process located at the New Jersey VA Medical Center, 385 Tremont Avenue, East Orange New Jersey, Building 1 


Government-Furnished Property, Material, Equipment, or Information (GFP, GFM, GFE, or GFI)

No Government-furnished property will be provided.

*Rated to 280Â° Fahrenheit, this high temp caster features four precision bearings in each caster - best
in the industry.
*Twin precision sealed ball bearings.
*6" diameter, two swivel and two with direction lock.

*No need for gloves or towels to wrap around hot metal handles.
*The handle is designed within the perimeter of the bumper to reduce impact at the push pull location.
*For ease of access and convenience, a door catch mechanism has been integrated into the glass-filled
polymer handle system (black release button).

Windowed Doors
*rev o lu tion  case cart doors feature an industry first - clear, impact and scratch resistant poly
windows.
*Windows allow staff to view contents of cart and determine the status at a glance.
*Doors are constructed using a combination of aluminum and stainless steel.
*The aluminum reduces the overall weight of the cart making it easier to maneuver.
*Aluminum doors are powder-coated with a custom high-temp, chip resistant resin.

Bumper System
*High temp bumper is bolt-mounted directly to the bottom of the cart creating a smaller overall
footprint.
*The four piece bumper assembly can now be easily replaced or adjusted in the field with the use of
common tools.

Shelf Lockarm
*The new two position, spring loaded arm mechanism securely locks the shelf in the extended
or closed position.

movement from the shelf.

Shelf Roller
*The new rev o lu tion  cart shelving system uses a self lubricating, glass filled rollers for ease of
movement.

rollers will not create unwanted friction, gall the material, or create uneven wear surfaces that make
shelf movement difficult.

Cabinet
*The stainless steel wrap features rounded corner construction for increased strength.
*The integrated body, floor and doors increases the cart s overall rigidity allowing the cart to sustain
greater impact while keeping the structure square.

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br /><br />Please note that to qualify as an eligible small business for purposes of a small business set-aside, at least 50% of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel must be expended for employees of the small business awardee (see FAR 52.219-14 Limitations on Subcontracting).<br /><strong><br />Purpose and Objectives<br /></strong>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency whose mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability, conducting, supporting and making medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) is a translational science center that prides itself on its tremendously productive pipeline and is innovative in several ways. NCATS brings together a diverse range of scientists, including medicinal chemists, biologists, toxicologists, and engineers, in to ultimately translate basic science into real products and services that help improve people's lives.<br /><br />Screening is often the starting point in development and a wealth of knowledge is obtained from screening a diverse collection. It provides the starting point of all information for medicinal chemistry's structure-activity relationship (SAR) design to synthesize novel compounds that have more desirable properties. A diverse and novel screening collection provides the backbone of our operation and is imperative for translational sciences to obtain effective small molecules with on-target effects.<br /><br />These small molecules have been designed around analysis of available chemical and biological information, identification of key pathways modules/targets, computational and "wet biology" assessment of target druggability and potential binding domains. The resulting information is analyzed by synthetic and medicinal chemistry teams in order to bring new chemical diversity and to design unique scaffolds that are likely to interact with the designated targets yielding focused compound libraries. Having such small molecules will make a huge impact in our screening against the variety of targets that NCATS works on and will also help tremendously in bioinformatics analysis which will allow a more thorough and effective SAR expansion by the medicinal chemist.<br /><strong><br />Project Requirements<br /></strong>NCATS seeks to purchase one (1) Chemical Library of 216 specific compounds with the following salient characteristics:<br />1. 5mg of each compound (if 5mg not available, 1mg or more acceptable)<br />2. Each compound must be guaranteed to have a purity of &gt;90% that has been confirmed by NMR and/or LCMS spectra<br /><br />NCATS will provide tared, barcoded 4mL glass vials for samples to be dispensed in. It is ideal for all samples to be dispensed into the glass vials provided by NCATS, but it is sufficient if original packaging is provided for a subset of the compounds.<br /><br />The Contractor must be able to provide the following electronic information for each required molecule: <br />1. The amount dispensed to each vial reported to 1 decimal point (e.g. 4.9mg, 5.0mg, 5.2mg) <br />2. The vial's barcode associated to your sample's catalog number, SMILES, CAS, and name in either an Excel file or SDF<br /><em><br />See attachment for the list of specific compounds.<br /></em><strong><br />Anticipated Period of Performance<br /></strong>Delivery is to occur within eight (8) weeks after receipt of tubes from NCATS.<br /><strong><br />Required Information<br /></strong>All capability statements must provide the following: (1) DUNS number; (2) organization name; (3) organization address; (4) point of contact; (5) point of contact title, address, telephone, and email address; and (6) size and type of business (e.g., 8(a), HUBZone, etc.) pursuant the applicable NAICS code.<br /><strong><br />Submission Instructions and Due Date<br /></strong>Written capability statements must be SUBMITTED NO LATER THAN 12:00PM EDT FRIDAY, AUGUST 24, 2018 to the below Contracting Office Address, Attn: Kimberly Espinosa. Electronic capability statements will be accepted by the primary point of contact listed below.<br /><strong><br />Disclaimer and Important Notes<br /></strong>This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the organization's qualifications to perform the work.

<DESC>1. Brief Description of Information Sought.
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is being issued to assist the Government in market research about industry capabilities to provide information and communications technology (ICT) supply chain risk information through provision of "due diligence" research based on publicly and commercially available unclassified data. DHS seeks information about capabilities that address risk as a function of threat, vulnerability, likelihood, and consequences, and aggregate multiple data sets into structured archives suitable for analysis and visualization of the relationships of businesses, individuals, addresses, supply chains, and related information.</p>
<p>The information generated through the due diligence capability will be shared between organizations and may be used in combination with other information to broadly address supply chain risks to Federal, State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial governments, and Critical Infrastructure owners and operators (hereinafter, "stakeholders").</p>
<p>The government seeks information about capabilities that enable identification and mitigation of ICT products (e.g., hardware, software, devices) that may contain potentially malicious functionality, are counterfeit, are vulnerable due to deficient manufacturing practices within the supply chain, or are otherwise determined to enable or constitute a threat to the United States.</p>
<p>The government also seeks information about capabilities that enable identification and mitigation of supply chain risks presented by ICT-based services (e.g., cloud services, managed services), as well as service providers that use ICT and the ICT contains, transmits, or processes information provided by or generated for the stakeholder to support the operations or assets of a stakeholder entity (e.g., professional services).</p>
<p>The categories of capability offerings that the government is interested in learning more about include (1) supply chain risk due diligence information; and (2) tool, product or system solution used to deliver due diligence information.</p>
<p>2. Background.</p>
<p>This RFI is intended to build upon the knowledge gained from prior information requests and industry and stakeholder engagements related to business due diligence and supply chain risk management.</p>
<p>Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM) is the process of identifying, assessing, and mitigating the risks associated with the distributed and interconnected nature of ICT product and service supply chains. It covers the entire lifecycle of a system (including design, development, distribution, deployment, acquisition, maintenance, and destruction) as supply chain threats and vulnerabilities may intentionally or unintentionally compromise an ICT product or service at any stage of the lifecycle.</p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), all other Federal, State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial governments, and Critical Infrastructure owners and operators are highly dependent on vendors and integrators of ICT (including IoT) to accomplish their various missions, and as a result, the global ICT supply chain is a significant source of risk to the nation.</p>
<p>The government anticipates due diligence research will be conducted on selected suppliers that provide products, services, or solutions which connect in any way to a stakeholder information system or which contain, transmit, or process information provided by or generated for the stakeholder to support the operations and assets of a stakeholder entity. Possible subjects of due diligence research include all companies directly involved in delivery of products, services, and solutions to stakeholders, through all tiers of the supply chain.</p>
<p>Examples of how due diligence information may be shared with stakeholders include, but are not limited to:<br />&bull; Shared without enrichment; and<br />&bull; Shared after enrichment with government or other stakeholder data.</p>
<p>Examples of how due diligence information may be used by stakeholders include, but are not limited to:<br />&bull; Assisting in market research, development of source selection evaluation criteria and other solicitation provisions, and contract performance indicators;<br />&bull; Supporting testing and evaluation activities and information system authorizations;<br />&bull; Measuring contractor performance; and<br />&bull; Supporting more detailed supply chain risk assessments, audits, or investigations.</p>
<p>3. Intended purpose. The DHS intends to use the information received in response to this RFI for planning purposes and to help define requirements for a cyber supply chain risk assessment capability to support stakeholders.</p>
<p>3.1. Objectives for this capability include:<br />3.1.1. Affordable;<br />3.1.2. Automated process supported by threat analysis;<br />3.1.3.

Minimize duplication of effort and cost from better decision-making, using a shared solution, centralized purchase of data sets, and reuse of due diligence information; and <br />3.1.7. Aligned, as much as possible, with similar practices, such as those emerging or evolving in the vendor community and insurance industry</p>
<p>3.2. No proposals are being requested or accepted with this notice. No contract shall be awarded from this notice. This special notice does not constitute a request for a quote or proposal for the procurement of products or services.</p>
<p>3.3. In order to obtain additional information, the Government may hold an industry day or schedule one-on-one meetings.</p>

<DESC><strong><br />REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<br /></strong>&nbsp;
<p><strong>BIOLOGICAL ADVANCED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY /<br />PHARMACEUTICAL COUNTERMEASURE INFRASTRUCTURE</strong></p>
<p><strong>DATE:</strong> August 17, 2018</p>
<p><strong>TITLE:</strong> CONTRACT DEVELOPMENT AND MANUFACTURING ORGANIZATION PARTNERSHIPS</p>
<p><strong>RFI No.:</strong> 18-BARDA-CDMO-RFI-001</p>
<p><strong>1.0 Description</strong></p>
<p>1.1 The Pharmaceutical Countermeasure Infrastructure Division (PCI) in support of the Biomedical Advanced Research Development Authority (BARDA) is seeking information on how an interested contractor could assist the U.S. Government (USG) with Medical Countermeasure Manufacturing Preparedness</p>
<p>1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY<br /><br /><strong>This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does NOT constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), a promise to issue an RFP, or a commitment to issue any type of solicitation in the future.</strong> This RFI does not commit the USG to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, BARDA is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.</p>
<p>Respondees are advised that the USG will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Submission is voluntary and is not required to propose to subsequent solicitations on this topic (if any).</p>
<p>If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps)</span> website and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness &amp; Response (ASPR) website at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">https://www.medicalcountermeasures.gov/</span>. It is the responsibility of the potential repondee to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to any potential requirement.</p>
<p><strong>2.0 Background</strong></p>
<p>Within the USG, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) is tasked with protecting the civilian population by providing leadership in research, development, acquisition, deployment, and use of effective medical countermeasures to treat the adverse health effects resulting from intentional exposure to chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threat agents, pandemic influenza and emerging infectious diseases.</p>
<p>In an effort to improve preparedness capabilities, the USG is seeking to establish potential on-going relationships with Contract Development and Manufacturing Organizations (CDMOs) in addition to the existing contracts supporting the Centers for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing (CIADMs) and the Fill Finish Manufacturing Network (FFMN).</p>
<p>There are several challenges facing these types of relationships, and as such, the USG is seeking feedback from CDMO organizations on how to best partner with the USG, while improving access to CDMO capabilities, capacities, and availability. The traditional CDMO / Product Sponsor relationship is to have the Product Sponsor identify and subcontract activities to a CDMO. With this model, the USG has limited visibility into the items identified above, having to work through the Product Sponsor to ask questions and receive information from the CDMO. In a USG / CDMO Prime contract situation, the relationship is typically reversed, having the Product Sponsor as the subcontractor to the CDMO Prime, which can lead to contractual concerns between the two parties as it is outside of the familiar contractual situation between both parties.</p>
<p>Additionally, the majority of the USG preparedness products developed have limited to no commercial value outside of a USG stockpile, or manufacture during a declared Public Health Emergency, therefore future revenue streams are limited. Taking resources away from projects to develop and qualify processes which are only going to be utilized inconsistently, or in time of a declared Public Health Emergency has been a deterrent to USG partnering in the past.</p>
<p><strong>3.0 Requested Information</strong></p>
<p>The USG is seeking feedback from CDMO organizations on how best to partner with the USG with recommendations to address the partnership concerns identified below:</p>
<p>1) USG access to CDMO Capabilities, Capacities, and Availability</p>
<p>a. Discuss options to maintain USG visibility to the evolving technical and business practices regarding pharmaceutical development and manufacturing.</p>
<p>2) Prime / Product Sponsor relationships</p>
<p>a. Discuss options to avoid contractual relationship issues between the Prime and Product Sponsor, while maintaining the items outlined in 1) above.</p>
<p>3) Preparedness Limitations to Annualized Revenue</p>
<p>a. Discuss best ways for the USG to incentivize partnering for preparedness purposes, outlining best practices to engage with the USG and Product Sponsors for providing CDMO services when the larger portion of activities would be one time only, with a wait for a declared health emergency for additional response.</p>
<p><strong>4.0 Responses</strong></p>
<p>4.1 Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI with a white paper.</p>
<p>4.2 White papers shall adhere to the following:</p>

<SOLNBR>140G0218Q0226
<RESPDATE>082218
<ARCHDATE>10012018
<CONTACT>Valdez, Robert
<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT: This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE. The U.S. Geological Survey is conducting a MARKET SURVEY to determine the interest and capability of any firm eligible to compete under NAICS code 334516 with a Small Business Size Standard of 1000 employees for a high vacuum metal coater.  

THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. ALL COST ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION AS REQUESTED BY THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE SHALL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CONTRACTOR. Submission is voluntary. 

Minimum Specification: Chamber Size: > 100 mm diameter &  >60 mm high; Vacuum pump: Dry scroll or other oil free pump(s); Monitor: Thickness monitor with 1 nm accuracy; Stage: Rotating stage that can accommodate up to four 25 mm epoxy mounts; Target Material: Iridium; Control: Programmable Logic Controller; Termination: Automated feature based on elapsed time or completion of programmable recipe.  The high vacuum metal coater must place the quartz crystal thickness monitor in the center of the stage flush with the sample surface to allow for a more accurate coating thickness than those offset to the side.  The high vacuum metal coater must allow for vacuum transfer of samples that are sensitive to surface oxidation, as this is critical for low KV analysis of surfaces that can quickly build an oxidation layer during transport from the coater to the instrument.  

Responses to this announcement are requested from (1) SBA certified Small Business HubZone firms; (2) Small Business firms certified by a Small Business Administration (SBA) district or regional office for participation in the 8(a) program; (3) Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business firms; (4) Small Businesses. 

In response to this announcement, please indicate your firm's socioeconomic status (e.g. small business, service-disabled veteran-owned, women owned, HUBZone, etc.)  This information will assist the Government in determining how small businesses can fit into the acquisition strategy.

A firm is considered small under NAICS code 334516 with a Small Business Size Standard of  1000 employees. Any information submitted is voluntary. If sufficient interest and capability is not received from firms in categories (1) through (4) above, any solicitation may be issued as unrestricted without further consideration.

Interested small business firms shall submit (1) NAME, ADDRESS, and PHONE NUMBER OF THE FIRM (including DUNS NUMBER); (2) a CAPABILITY STATEMENT including (a) RECENT (within the last three fiscal years) RELEVANT (similar projects to this requirement) performance history (identify the name of the owner and their point(s) of contact with telephone and fax numbers, e-mail addresses; and (b) in what capacity (e.g., prime, subcontractor etc.) they performed the work; and (3) their SIZE STATUS. 

Your company must have a DUNs number and be registered on-line at the System for Award Management (SAM). You will also be required to provide your small business status information either via the RFP or the On-line Representations and Certifications (ORCA) also located at the SAM website before an award to your company can be made. Your on-line ORCA registration will cover any/all of your offers to the Federal Government, and only needs updated annually.

All responses must be submitted NLT August 22, 2018 at 3:00pm MST via e-mail to: rvaldez@usgs.gov.

This is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP) or Invitation for Bid (IFB) and does not constitute any commitment by the Government. Responses to this sources sought notice will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. All interested sources must respond to future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this market survey. Any solicitation that may be issued will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website and no paper copies will be provided.

Set-Asides, Limits on subcontracting, and the Non-Manufacturer Rule
Complete responses to this notice will assist the VA in determining any potential set-aside for the requirement.  Not providing all information requested in response to this notice may result in the VA being unable to determine a vendor potentially capable of satisfying the requirement and, subsequently, if the  rule of two  criteria is not met, a specific set-aside category may not be decided by the Contracting Officer.  To qualify as a small business under a small business set-aside contract, the offeror must be considered a small business under the NAICS code assigned to the procurement.  In addition, the small business must either (1) be the manufacturer of the end item being produced (and the end item must be produced in the US) or (2) comply with the non-manufacturing regulations in 13 CFR 121.406.  

Summary of Non-Manufacturing regulations:

The small business is primarily engaged in the retail or wholesale trade and normally sells the type of item being supplied;
The small business takes ownership or possession of the item(s) with its personnel, equipment, or facilities in a manner consistent with industry practices; and 
The small business will supply the end item of a small business manufacturer, processor, or producer made in the United States, unless the SBA has issued a waiver to this requirement.  When multiple items are being acquired, a waiver is not required if at least 50% of the estimated contract value is composed of items that are manufactured by small businesses.

The NRC requires vendor support and confirmed that Integrated Security Technologies does not have any resellers. These kiosks have been tested, secured and are an integral part of the NRC's current enterprise architecture and technical reference model. They are also component of the NRC's overall Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM) program.</p>
<p>The kiosks are custom and maintenance must be provided by the manufacturer. Even if other vendors could<br />currently meet the NRC's requirements, the NRC does not currently intend to replace its investment in the<br />Integrated Security Technologies kiosks. To do so would cause the NRC to incur significant additional cost, would<br />be highly disruptive and would introduce significant risk to the NRC. Standards for agency software toolsets are established and maintained for several years to maximize the return on those investments and to minimize<br />disruption to agency operations.</p>

In 1931, the company created the first pellet mill, the 30 HP Flat Bed with stationary flat die, and we became California Pellet Mill (CPM).</p>
<p>In the years that followed, CPM created more pellet mill models with additional features. In the 1980s, they greatly expanded their product offerings through the creation of Roskamp Champion with the acquisition of the Roskamp Roller Mill Company and Champion Hammermills. In 2002, Beta Raven, a leading supplier of feed mill automation and ingredient scaling systems, joined their team.</p>
<p>With facilities around the globe, CPM sell and service machinery and equipment in Europe, Asia, Latin America, North America and other parts of the world. CPM are the world's leading supplier of process equipment to the animal feed and the oilseed processing industries. CPM also serve the corn wet milling, pet food, ethanol and wood industries, and they are the world leader in pelleting, particle size reduction equipment and automation.</p>
<p>Pursuant to the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.</p>

<SOLNBR>RWPDA2-PA022
<CONTACT>David M. Patti, Agreements Specialist, Phone 5864676071, Email david.m.patti4.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>FEDBIZOPPS NOTICE OF INTENT FOR OTHER TRANSACTIONAL AGREEMENT (OTA)<br /><br />This Notice of Intent is not a Request for Prototype Proposals but is provided for planning purposes only. A project agreement will not be awarded from this announcement. <br /><br />The Army Contracting Command, Warren, Michigan, in conjunction with the Program Executive Office for Ground Combat Systems (PEO GCS), Project Director Main Battle Tank Systems (PD MBTS), Product Director Combat Recovery Systems (PdD CRS), has the requirement to upgrade the M88A2 Heavy Equipment Recovery Combat Utility Lift &amp; Evacuation System (HERCULES) vehicle.<br /><br />The M88A2 HERCULES provides towing, winching, and hoisting operations to support battlefield recovery operations and evacuation of heavy tanks and other tracked combat vehicles. The HERCULES recovers tanks mired to different depths, removes/replaces M1 Abrams turrets and power packs and uprights overturned heavy combat vehicles. Due to recent and ongoing M1A2 Main Battle Tank (MBT) modernization efforts, the M88A2 recovery vehicle requires upgrades and improvements to ensure it can accomplish the required task of single vehicle recovery of the heaviest tracked combat vehicle which is currently the M1A2 MBT. With all force protection kits applied, the weight of the M1A2 MBT is approximately 80 tons (160,000lbs.). <br /><br />In the near future the Government intends to issue a Request for White Paper (RWP) in support of the M88A2 HERCULES Single Vehicle Recovery (SVR) Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) effort through the Detroit Arsenal Automotive Other Transaction Agreement (DA2 OTA), managed by the Defense Automotive Technologies Consortium (DATC), US Army Tank and Automotive Research Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) and Army Contracting Command (ACC) - Warren. <br /><br />This effort will require Project Agreement Holders (PAH) to design, build and deliver up to nine (9) M88A3 production representative prototype vehicles to meet the requirements defined within the RWP by modifying United States Government (USG) provided M88A2 vehicles. The prototypes will be subjected to a series of Government tests to validate that the M88A3 meets the requirements of the P-Spec. A follow-on sole source contract(s) or agreement(s), or combination thereof, to provide production M88A3 vehicles and ancillary engineering and logistics support, may result from successful completion of this effort. The immediate follow-on production effort is targeting 35 vehicles per year for two years. The USG is anticipating follow-on production contracts until the entire Army Authorized Objective of 933 is completed.<br />Only DATC members that have submitted a complete White Paper (WP) in response to the RWP, whether individually or as a named participant on a team, will be allowed to submit a proposal in the subsequent Request for Prototype Proposal (RFPP) phase. The Government will down select based on if the WP submission is complete and acceptable.
<p>Static Vehicle Display</p>
<p>To aide in the drafting of the RWP response, arrangements have been made to allow Lead Systems Integrators (LSI) and their teams that are considering submitting a WP to review an M88A2 vehicle at TACOM. Potential offerors that are not planning to act as a LSI will not be provided vehicle access, they must arrange access with their potential LSI.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Air Shelters USA LLC.<br /><br />The Office of Research Services needs to purchase Zumro Tech Decon System. Air Shelters USA, LLC is the sole manufactures of the brand; Zumro rapid inflatable decontamination shelters designed for the specific and technical environmental needs of the NIH that shall be used for emergency response to chemical, radiological and biological release incidents on the NIH Campus and surrounding communities. Air Shelters USA, LLC has proprietary air frame structures, connector features and equipment that no other manufacture can produce that reduce deployment time, maintenance training and storage of the system. The air frame structures allow for repositioning after deployment due to environmental shifts and secondary contamination from wind movement of byproducts of the incident. The oversized air frame structure allows for the highest safety factor in the industry, so mitigation of the contained patients, equipment and shelters will be completed when the mission dictates.

<CONTACT>Suzanne Johnston, Purchasing Agent, Phone 907-789-6061, Fax 907-789-6094, Email suzanne.johnston@noaa.gov
<DESC>NOAA's NMFS, Alaska Fisheries Science Center, Auke Bay Laboratories, intends to negotiate, on a single source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Northwest Technology, Inc.
<p>The Alaska Fisheries Science Center, Fisheries Monitoring and Analysis (FMA) Division and the Salmon Ocean Ecology (SOE) program requires T-Wand Coded Wire Detectors manufactured by Northwest Marine Technology, INC (NWT). These metal-detecting wands are ultrasensitive, hand-held, rugged, waterproof, and float which makes them suitable for the harsh Alaska fish processing and dock conditions. The wands are capable of detecting specific coded wire tags (CWTs) which are 1.1 mm long, metal tags, and used extensively for Pacific salmon research. FMA and SOE require these specialized NWT T-Wand detectors to effectively sample the salmon bycatch in the Alaskan groundfish and halibut fishery for mandated data collection. The tags that have been used over the past 10 years on the salmon are NWT tags and therefore can only be read with NWT T-wands.</p>
<p>Supporting rationale. Only one source or brand name is reasonably available as detailed below: <br />Brand Name - This particular brand name is essential to the requirement and market research indicates similar products do not meet or cannot be modified to meet agency needs. The T-Wand CWT need to be able to detect the extremely small tags used in Pacific salmon in order to collect salmon data. In order to detect the 1.1 mm tags, an ultra-sensitive metal detecting device is necessary. In addition, the device must be hand-held, rugged, and waterproof for the Alaska climate and sea conditions with a minimum detection range of 5.5cm. NWT is the only manufacturer of metal detecting wands that allow FMA observers to sample salmon bycatch per our data collection mandates. NWT exclusively manufactures and sells both the coded wire tags and the equipment to detect them in the field, hatchery and lab. There are no other vendors on the market with a comparable product and NWT holds patents on all of their CWT detection devices, including the T-wand. Purchasing CWT wands from Northwest Marine Technology will ensure that the equipment we are currently using from this company can be utilized for this and future coded-wire tagging events in Alaska. This requirement is essential to the successful completion of all projects using equipment from Northwest Marine Technology Inc.</p>
<p>Compatibility to existing systems or equipment - The required supplies or service must be compatible in all aspects (form, fit, and function) with existing systems or equipment and the source is uniquely qualified to meet the requirement. The equipment to be purchased is only manufactured by Northwest Marine Technology Inc. and is the only product on the market that is compatible with the coast-wide salmon tagging studies and with the equipment used in Alaska with the coded-wire tagging project, which eliminates all other manufacturers as possible substitutes. Mainstream metal detecting wands used in other industries have a far less sensitivity. The primary use for these wands is to detect weapons under a person's clothing. A coded wire tag is much smaller than a grain of rice and, in fact, is barely visible to the naked human eye. Metal detecting wands used for security screening purposes do not even advertise their sensitivity because they do not need to be very sensitive. No other industry uses metal detecting wands that meet our requirements.</p>
<p>Without NWT T-wands, FMA &amp; SOE will be unable to effectively sample salmon bycatch in the shore side processing facilities in Alaska. Snouts have been collected from fish with clipped adipose fins in the past, but hatcheries no longer regularly clip all adipose fins of hatchery fish. T-wands will allow us to take snouts from tagged fish, and not miss any important data. These data are used by NOAA and other state agencies and academic institutions for management decisions and assess which stocks are affected by the groundfish fishery.</p>
<p>Award for this requirement will be in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13. Anticipated value will be under the Simplified acquisition procedures with an estimated value of less than $150,000.00. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. It is the Government's belief that only Northwest Marine Technology can provide the items stated above. If you feel that your firm possesses the ability to provide these requirements, then you must respond by demonstrating your firm's technical capability to meet these requirements by September 1, 2018. No known potential alternate sources exist which could satisfy these requirement</p>

<DESC>Synopsis:<br />This acquisition is being conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 13.1-Simplified Acquisition Procedures <br />The United States Census Bureau intends to negotiate, on a sole-source basis, a fixed price purchase order to the Brattle Group, 7 Times Square, Suite 1700, New York, NY 10036.
<p>The Brattle Group shall provide expert financial analysis services to the Government in support of the 2020 Decennial Census. <br /><br />Market research efforts have indicated that the Brattle Group is the only known source with key expert knowledge of financial risk analysis requirements of the 2020 Decennial Census operations of the U.S. Census Bureau. The Brattle Group possesses critical task knowledge of a Census Bureau procurement in order to provide necessary risk assessment. <br /><br />The Brattle Group is the only responsible provider of this unique expert financial analysis skillset. The Brattle Group is a known provider of testifying and consulting expert services in litigation matters related to mergers and acquisitions, dissenting shareholder actions, leveraged buyouts, recapitalization, debt recharacterization and avoidance actions. Additionally, the former acquisition history of the Brattle Group is extremely pertinent and detrimental to a current acquisition. Not using the critical knowledge and key expert services of the Brattle Group puts the 2020 Decennial Census at high risk of failure. Therefore, the Brattle Group is the only responsible source to provide key expert financial analysis services to the U.S. Census Bureau. <br /><br />The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition for this simplified acquisition is FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).</p>
<p>This is not a request for competitive quotes; however, all interested sources who believe they can meet the requirements may submit a capability statement no later than August 21, 2018 to the point of contact for this notice. Information received because of this notice will be considered solely for determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement and will be at the sole discretion of the Contracting Officer.</p>

<DESC>The USACE, Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) Contracting Office intends to issue a sole source award to GEM Systems, Inc., 135 Spy Court, Markham, ON Canada L3R 5H6, for the purchase of a GPS enabled, cold operating magnetic gradiometer with VLF acquisition and total field magnetometer base station. The Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC), Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL) currently has a research project that requires a GPS enabled magnetic gradiometer field base station to measure the earth's magnetic field at a discrete location. A high sensitivity magnetic gradiometer and base station are to augment EMI detection of buried munitions in support of range assessment and sustainment on cold regions projects. The required specification s are as follows: The gradiometer should use potassium based sensor rather than cesium vapor or proton procession as potassium sensor offers greater levels of sensitivity and accuracy; Integrated very low frequency electromagnetic induction capability; Allows for the concurrent VLF measurements, and can operate in the extreme temperatures of the cold regions; and A base station (GSM-19), GPS components for the base station and gradiometer, VLF module, and data reduction cable. <br />This procurement action is exercised as sole source under statutory authority set forth under FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i). This Notice of Intent is for information purposes only. The Government intends to procure from only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i).

The program office within Program Executive Officer, Land Systems Marine Corps (PEO LS) for the Common Aviation Command and Control (CAC2S) intends to award an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract on a sole-source basis to Raytheon Solipsys, 8170 Maple Lawn Blvd, Fulton, MD 20759 for software licenses for the Multi Source Correlator Tracker (MSCT) and Tactical Display Framework (TDF) software applications and software maintenance, upgrade and modification services in support of the CAC2S Increment I systems. This effort is expected to be awarded in Fiscal Year 2019 with an approximate five year ordering period. <br /><br />The MSCT and TDF are commercial computer software applications that have been modified to meet the Marine Corps CAC2S requirements. In accordance with the CAC2S Acquisition Strategy, the CAC2S program did not acquire Government purpose rights for commercial hardware or software, and has only limited rights to the core MSCT and TDF software. Raytheon Solipsys retains the rights needed to modify the MSCT and TDF source code and remains the only source available to provide software lifecycle support. Raytheon Solipsys is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the MSCT and TDF Commercial Off-The-Shelf software applications. These applications provide the primary tactical/ mission functionality of the CAC2S software suite. Over the course of development of CAC2S, these applications have been integrated/interfaced with other tactical information systems and networks to enable CAC2S to fully meet the CAC2S Increment I Capability Production Document requirements. Specifically, the MSCT and TDF perform the predominant functions required to meet the CAC2S Data Fusion Key Performance Parameter. Due to the extent of development, integration and testing of these applications within the CAC2S, replacement or use of other applications to meet the CAC2S Increment I requirements is not practicable. <br /><br />THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This acquisition is being pursued on a sole source basis under the statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements". Unless stated herein, no additional information is available. Responsible interested parties may submit a capability statement in which they identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement if received within seven calendar days after the date of the publication of this synopsis. The Government will consider all information received by the response date. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses received as a result of this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All submissions become Government property and will not be returned. Contractors are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this notice of intent. The North American Industry Classification System code is 541511 - Custom Computer Programming Services.<br />&nbsp;<br />GENERAL INFORMATION: The information provided herein is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. The Government has not made a commitment to procure any of the items discussed and this notice should not be construed as a commitment or as authorization to incur cost for which reimbursement would be required or sought. <br /><br />All responses to this notice shall be submitted to Mr. Alexander Lyon at alexander.lyon@usmc.mil and Ms. Christine Kuney at christine.kuney@usmc.mil.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), SAO West, Network Contracting Office 21, intends to enter into a sole source procurement for Carefusion Pyxis anesthesia equipment, automated medication dispensing equipment, software, support services, and analytics services for the VA Southern Nevada Healthcare System (VASNHS), 6990 North Pecos Road, North Las Vegas, Nevada, 89086. In accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(2)   Soliciting from A Single Source, the Department of Veterans Affairs intends to award a firm-fixed price contract on a sole source basis with Carefusion Solutions, LLC, 3750 Torrey View Ct, San Diego, CA 92130 for furnishing the Pyxis anesthesia equipment, automated medication dispensing equipment, software, support services, and analytics services, installation, and implementation. The contractor shall deliver and install equipment at the VASNHS located at 6900 North Pecos Road, North Las Vegas, Nevada 89086 within ninety (90) days after contract award. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 339113 and the Business Size Standard is 750 employees.
The sole source rationale is based on the proprietary nature of the equipment and software and their unique compatibilities with existing hardware and software currently in use. Carefusion is the only contractor that is currently able to integrate with the VA s systems. Also, Carefusion is the only vendor capable of providing the supplies and services without the VA experiencing substantial duplication of costs that could not be expected to be recovered through competition.
This notice of intent is not a solicitation or request for competitive quotes. No solicitation package is available. A determination not to compete this requirement is solely within the discretion of the U.S. Government. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the Agency. Any capability statement, proposal, or quote provided shall be at no cost or obligation to the Government. Responses must be received no later than 11:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time on Monday, September 10, 2018. All responses shall be submitted to Susanne Christen via email at Susanne.Christen@va.gov. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted.

<p>(2) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;</p>
<p>(3) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor.</p>
<p>(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly-</p>

[The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.]</p>

<p>(i) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations;</p>
<p>(ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii));</p>
<p>(iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and</p>
<p>(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.</p>
<p>(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies-</p>
<p>(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Labor Standards wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and</p>
<p>(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.</p>

To assure timely and equitable evaluation of the quote, the offeror must follow the instructions contained herein. The quote must be complete, self-sufficient, and respond directly to the requirements of this solicitation. <br />B. The contracting officer has determined there is a high probability of adequate price competition in this acquisition. Upon examination of the initial offers, the contracting officer will review this determination and if, in the contracting officer's opinion, adequate price competition exists no additional cost information will be requested and certification under FAR 15.406-2 will not be required. However, if at any time during this competition the contracting officer determines that adequate price competition no longer exists offerors may be required to submit information other than cost or pricing data to support a determination of price reasonableness.<br />C. Specific Instructions: Quotes shall be submitted in two parts:</p>
<p>1. Part I - Price quote with price annotated on the provided pricing sheets; and<br />2. Part II - Past Performance:</p>
<p>(a) Quality and Satisfaction Rating for Contracts Completed in the past three years: Provide information currently available (letters, metrics, customer surveys, independent surveys, etc.) which demonstrates customer satisfaction with overall job performance and quality of completed product for a relevant type contract. In addition, explain corrective actions taken in the past, if any, for substandard performance and any current performance problems such as cost overruns, extended performance periods, numerous warranty calls, etc.</p>
<p>(b) Past Performance Questionnaires: The government will evaluate the quality and extent of offeror's performance deemed relevant to the requirements of this solicitation by utilizing the responses to the past performance questionnaires. NOTE: QUESTIONNAIRES MUST BE SUBMITTED BY THE RATER. QUESTIONNAIRES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED WHEN SUBMITTED BY THE OFFEROR. Recent past performance is identified as relevant past performance performed within the last three years and relevant past performance is defined as successfully performing preventative maintenance and repair of boiler controls similar to the size and quantity of those listed in this RFQ.</p>
<p>If a teaming arrangement is contemplated, provide complete information as to the arrangement, including any relevant and recent past/present performance information on previous teaming arrangements with same partner. If this is a first time joint effort, each party to the arrangement must provide a list of past and present relevant contracts.</p>
<p>(c) Subcontractor Consent: Past performance information pertaining to a subcontractor cannot be disclosed to the prime offeror without the subcontractor's consent. Provide with the quote a letter from all subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement, consenting to the release of their past performance information to the prime contractor.</p>
<p>(d) Documents submitted in response to this solicitation must be fully responsive to and consistent with the following:</p>
<p>- Requirements of the solicitation and performance work statement (PWS), and government standards and regulations pertaining to the PWS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items <br />BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: This is a competitive best value award decision in which competing offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis of past performance being more important than price. By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale.</p>
<p>Price Evaluation: The government shall rank all offers by price, including any option prices. An offeror's proposed prices will be determined by multiplying the quantities identified by the proposed unit price for each contract line item number (CLIN) to confirm the extended amount for each. Offerors whose total evaluated price is unreasonable in accordance with FAR 13.106-3(a) may not be considered for award.</p>
<p>Performance Confidence Assessment: The contracting officer shall seek recent and relevant performance information on all offerors based on (1) questionnaires; (2) the past efforts provided by the offeror and (3) data independently obtained from other government i.e. Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS); Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS); Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS), or other databases; and interviews/questionnaires with Program Managers, Contracting Officers and Fee Determining Officials, and commercial sources and commercial sources. The government reserves the right to seek information on higher priced offerors if none of the lower priced offerors receive a "Substantial Confidence" performance confidence assessment.</p>
<p>a. Recent past performance is identified as relevant past performance performed within the last three (3) years and relevant past performance is defined as successfully performing preventative maintenance and repair of boiler controls similar to the size and quantity of those listed in this RFQ. The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the government to assess the offeror's probability of meeting the solicitation requirements based on the offeror's demonstrated past performance. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment of Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Limited Confidence, No Confidence, or Unknown Confidence. Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will not be rated as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror.</p>
<p>b. In evaluating past performance, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this RFQ.</p>
<p>c. If the lowest priced offer is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance confidence assessment, that offer represents the best value for the government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>d. If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance confidence assessment, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment or until all offerors are evaluated. The Contracting Officer shall then make an integrated assessment best value award decision.</p>
<p>e. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified. Offeror's may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their offer (for example, the relevance of past performance information) or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system.</p>
<p>f. Offerors are responsible for submitting a well-written quote with adequately-detailed information that allows for a meaningful review by the procuring agency. Those offers who do not provide the detailed information risks an unfavorable rating.<br /><br />The evaluation of past performance information will take into account past performance information regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement when such information is relevant to the instant acquisition.</p>
<p>Please note that the General Accountability Office has held that offerors are responsible for submitting a well-written offer with adequately detailed information which clearly demonstrates compliance with the solicitation requirements and allows a meaningful review by the procuring agency.</p>
<p>ADDENDUM TO FAR 52.228-5 Insurance - Work on a Government Installation<br />1. The required workmen's compensation insurance shall extend to cover employer's liability for accidental bodily injury or death and for occupational disease with a minimum liability of $100,000.</p>
