<p>This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of&nbsp;foreign participation has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other&nbsp;restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation regarding eligible sources (e.g. if&nbsp;this is a small business set aside foreign sources may not participate as prime contractors but&nbsp;could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).<br /><br />Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12 (acquisitions of commercial items) in its solicitation for the described supplies. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.<br /><br />The Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.

It is suggested that <br />small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed.</p>
<p>While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price, technical and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation. An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate <br />government personnel.

<SUBJECT>NATO International Competitive Bidding (ICB): Pilot Study on Improving Strategic Foresight Analysis (SFA) Methodology Using Computing Power
<SOLNBR>IFIB-ACT-SACT-18-75
<RESPDATE>110818
<ARCHDATE>11112018
<CONTACT>Lee Ann Carpenter, Trade & Industry Analyst, Phone 202-482-2583, Fax 202-482-5650, Email LeeAnn.Carpenter@bis.doc.gov
<DESC>Supreme Allied Commander Transformation Headquarters (HQ SACT) intends to issue an Invitation for International Bidding (IFIB) for the performance of a pilot study on improving Strategic Foresight Analysis (SFA) methodology using computing power.
<p>Potential prime contractors must 1) be pre-approved for participation in NATO International Competitive Bidding (ICB), 2) be nominated to the bidders list by the U.S. Government, and 3) be companies that have performed two similar contracts within the last five years substantially similar in scope to the requirement described in the solicitation. Contractor personnel performing services under the contract must be citizens of a NATO nation, must have committed no criminal offences, and must have appropriate professional training and experience in a related field(s).</p>
<p>The reference for this project is IFIB-ACT-SACT-18-75.<br /><br />Award Type: Lowest Price, Technically Compliant</p>
<p>Partial bidding will be considered.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENT</p>
<p>This pilot study aims to provide a proof of concept to outline how computing power and data analysis tools could be used to support different aspects of strategic foresight analysis methodology. The deliverables of the SFA Pilot Study will be in two parts: the first, a report on how political trends will evolve over the next two decades and shape the future security context; the second, a report on the lessons learned using computing power in development of the SFA research, trend analysis and scenario development.</p>
<p>NATO ACT will conduct a pilot study by incorporating computing power and tools in the research, trend analysis, and scenario development parts of its methodology in the development of SFA reports. This pilot study encompasses three different but interrelated tasks:</p>
<p>Task 1: Research/Large Data Ingest Tool(s): Contractor is expected to reach out and access different web pages and other data sources that are identified by the requirements holder. Should contractor identify any additional data sources, those will be coordinated with the requirements holder. The use of commercial sources of information will be coordinated with the requirements holder to avoid duplicate payments. Data sources will be aligned with the SFA themes: Political-Human-Technology-Economics/Resources-Environment.</p>
<p>The contractor will use a much larger data set and data analytics to extract data from multiple sources. In this context, a wide variety of reports and media/social media sources will be included. Crowd sourcing techniques will also be used as part of data collection and verification. The tool(s) should enable machine learning as data collection continues. The contractor will be responsible for the storage of the collected data. This data will not be shared with any other entity without authorization of&nbsp;HQ SACT.</p>
<p>The data derived from multiple sources as an outcome of search will be stored, indexed, cleaned, and be ready for further analysis. Data will categorized and classified to allow the analyst access without any restrictions. The data will be structured in a common and usable format. It must also be possible to reliably automate structuring and formatting conversions. The origin and source of the data should be available to COTR to make sure sources are known so that credibility and reliability can be evaluated. The contractor will provide insights on how data is collected, categorized, cleaned, verified, and validated.</p>
<p>Task 2: Trend Analysis Tool(s): The contractor will use prepared data to further analyze trends, cause and effect relations and cluster trends to reduce the number of trends to a comprehensible level by the analysts. In order to analyze trends, the contractor will install/allow use of tool(s). The contractor will provide descriptive analytic tools, such as mind maps, to visualize the data and provide insights on the evolution and trajectory of the trends. the&nbsp; contractor will also provide tools for trend management and support for development of the reports that will provide insights on the trends and their associated implications.</p>
<p>Task 3. Scenario Development Tool(s): Based on the outcome of research, the contractor will provide a scenario development tool(s) that will be used to gain further insights, inform and/or validate trends and implications. The scenario tool(s) should allow &lsquo;what if' analysis for exploration of certain hypotheses. As a result, scenario analysis tool(s) will increase the ability to provide in-depth analysis of different situations and to identify indicators, trends, and associated defense and security implications.</p>
<p>BIDDING PROCEDURE</p>
<p>NATO ICB requires that the U.S. Government nominate U.S. prime contractors to the bidders list. Before the U.S. Government can nominate a U.S. prime contractor to the bidders list for this procurement, the U.S. firm must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. U.S. firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis.</p>
<p>The U.S. NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume indicating contracts completed as a prime contractor and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA.</p>
<p>U.S. firms can download a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application from the following website:</p>
<p>http://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/other-areas/strategic-industries-and-economic-security-sies/nato-related-business-opportunities</p>
<p>The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If, when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following in the text of your email:</p>
<p>- the title and/or solicitation number of the project<br />- the name/phone/FAX/email of the company employee who should receive the bid documents</p>
<p>Upon approval of the one-time NATO ICB application, the Department of Commerce will then know to issue a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE), which is the document used to nominate an approved facility to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>
<p>Firms should request a DOE (and, for firms new to NATO ICB, submit a completed one-time NATO ICB application) by: 08 November 2018</p>

<DESC><p align="left">Southwest Regional Maintenance Center (SWRMC) intends to issue&nbsp;a coast-wide&nbsp;solicitation N5523618R0011 for a firm-fixed price contract for the execution of the FY-19 Dry-Docking Service Craft (DSCO) Availability of the ARCO (ARDM-5) on the West Coast under NAICS 336611. The anticipated contract is considered a supply-type contract. The supply being procured is the repaired, mission-ready vessel, which is returned to service with the United States Navy&nbsp;Fleet. <br /><br />The six-month availability will include a combination of maintenance, modernization, and repair, and is expected to require a highly capable contractor with substantial facilities to include a dry-docking facility capabile of accomodating the ARCO (ARDM-5), and human resources capable of completing, coordinating, and integrating multiple areas of vessel maintenance, repair, and modernization.&nbsp;The contractor shall furnish the necessary supervision, material, labor, services, equipment, and facilities to perform the requirements in accordance with the Statement of Work.</p>
<p align="left">The CNO's Homeport Statute, 10 U.S. Code 7299a(c), requires a contract for short-term work for the overhaul repair, or maintenance of a naval vessel be performed at the homeport of the vessel, provided there is adequate competition. 10 U.S. Code 7299a(c)(4) defines "short term work" as work that will be for a period of 10 months or less. The&nbsp;DSCO for the&nbsp;ARCO (ARDM-5)&nbsp;is scheduled to be less than 10 months, however, market research revealed there is no adequate competition in the homeport area; therefore the FY19 DSCO will be solicited as a Coast-wide, Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract. Based on the complexity, magnitude, and duration of the requirement, the Government's market research indicates there are not two or more small business concerns capable of competing for the requirement. Consequently, this procurement will not be set-aside for small business in accordance with FAR 19.502-2(b).</p>
<p align="left">The applicable NAICS code is 336611 (Ship Building and Repair) with a small business size standard of 1,250 employees. In addition, this procurement will utilize the policies and procedures of FAR Part 15 "Contracting by Negotiation".</p>
<p align="left">This procurement is a Firm Fixed Price arrangement. Contractors that are interested in this procurement may send an e-mail providing all point of contact information (company name and address, CAGE code, primary and secondary points of contact, telephone phone number, and e-mail addresses) to <a href="mailto:allison.e.alexander@navy.mil">allison.e.alexander@navy.mil</a> with a&nbsp;copy to <a href="mailto:roderick.rioveros@navy.mil">roderick.rioveros@navy.mil</a> and subsequently will receive a courtesy notification when the solicitation is posted.</p>

INTRODUCTION
The Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Program Contracting Activity Central (PCAC) anticipates soliciting quotations and subsequently awarding a Firm-Fixed-Price contract for Surgical Equipment for the VA Northern California Health Care System (VANCHCS).  Acquisition of these items is part of the initial outfitting and activation of the new Chico VA Clinic in Chico, CA.

DESCRIPTION
A contract is needed for the Chico VA Clinic for below listed brand name or EQUAL equipment.

SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS/MANUFACTURERS CUTSHEETS
The contractor will be required to include manufacturer cut-sheets/specifications for  or equal  items quoted.

ADMINISTRATIVE
The solicitation will be issued as a  Request for Quote  (RFQ) conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Parts 12 and 13. The solicitation will be advertised as a total Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) set-aside.  The applicable NAICS code is 339112 with a size standard of 1000 Employees.   The solicitation will be issued on or about November 1, 2018 for approximately ten (10) calendar days.  Offerors will be required to submit their quotes electronically via email. 

Products that are purchased outside of our authorized distributor network on the gray market generate a number of concerns such as: counterfeit or adulterated devices, inadequate storage conditions, tracking issues in case of a recall, loss of warrantee, and most importantly patient safety. In some instances, unauthorized distributors procure products from an authorized distributor for resale. However, authorized distributors purchase products at list price, and the unauthorized distributors are reselling the product at a price point below list price, which raises questions about product sourcing.

The solicitation will include the requirement that responders provide an authorized distributor letter that states the responder is an authorized dealer/distributor of the OEM for the items being procured such that all product warranties and service and/or preventative maintenance agreements transfer to the VA and will be honored by the OEM or guarantees that the OEM gives authorization to the responder to fulfill all warranty, service, and/or preventative maintenance obligations for the equipment.  Vendors who are unable to supply proof of authorized dealer or distributorship will not be considered for award.

This notice is not a request for competitive offers.  Questions of a technical nature will not be answered as part of this notice; however, all general questions may be submitted in writing to the issuing office via email at Sandra.mruk@va.gov and Sandra.johnson3@va.gov.  Telephone calls will not be accepted.  The VA reserves the right to use only Federal Business Opportunities (FBO), via the internet, to provide notification of any amendments to this notice and the subsequent issuance of the solicitation.  It is the contractor s responsibility to view FBO daily for any amendments to this notice and the subsequent issuance of the solicitation.

<DESC><strong>SYNOPSIS:</strong> The Department of Defense, United States Air Force (USAF), Air Force Material Command (AFMC), 96th Range Group (RN), 782d Test Squadron, Guided Weapons Evaluation Facility (GWEF), is currently conducting market research seeking capabilities statements from potential sources, including small businesses (SB), 8(a), HUBZone, Economically Disadvantaged Woman-Owned (EDWOSB), Woman-Owned (WOSB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned (SDVOSB) small businesses that are capable of providing procurement, modification and sustainment support for 15 Flight Motion Simulator (FMS) Systems with an approximate net worth of $50M.
<p><br />Current GWEF FMS systems are single and multi-axis electro-hydraulic computer controlled systems manufactured by Carco Electronics and Acutronic USA. These FMS systems are used for hardware-in-the-loop testing and characterization of guided munition systems. For the purposes of this solicitation, the term "FMS systems" includes rate tables, aero-load simulators, and 3-axis and 5-axis simulators. The FMS systems are complex, custom OEM manufactured items. All engineering and technical information for these systems (drawings, specifications, performance data, software coding languages and software programming, interface communication protocols) is owned by and proprietary to the OEM, and not owned by the government. Proof of direct applied knowledge of or ability to obtain ready access to OEM proprietary engineering and technical information is required.</p>
<p>The FMS systems are in continual daily use. Rapid procurement, modification and sustainment support response time is required. Ownership of or ready access to at least one FMS system configured similar to the government configuration is desired in order to test and prove out support solutions prior to implementing to minimize system downtime.</p>
<p>Interested sources must provide demonstrated capacity and capability with verifiable past performance history to provide engineering and technical support for at least the following: procure, provide and install all materials, spare parts and consumables; design, test, modify and install system components, modifications and improvements; repair, refurbish, and maintain to manufacturer specifications; operate, calibrate, align, tune, and verify performance to manufacturer specifications; procure new FMS systems.</p>
<p>All interested vendors shall submit a response demonstrating their capability to provide this support to the Primary Point of Contact listed below along with a copy of the attached questionnaire. Proposals are not being requested or accepted at this time. As stipulated in FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No solicitation (Request for Proposal) exists at this time; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely within the Government's discretion.</p>

<p><br />1. GENERAL INFORMATION:</p>
<p>Army Contracting Command-Rock Island (ACC-RI) Contract Pricing Division has a requirement to obtain commodity and wage escalation data, history and forecasts, primarily at the national level.</p>
<p>2. SCOPE:</p>
<p>To accomplish this mission, ACC-RI requires subscription service that provides escalation/de-escalation forecasting services for the Contract Pricing Division. The type of subscription is Pricing &amp; Purchasing Service- North American Prices Module for 10 users. The period of the subscription will be from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2024, which includes a one year base with four option years.</p>
<p>The information required in the subscription includes but is not limited to the following areas:</p>
<p>Pricing &amp; Purchasing Service - North American Prices Module includes the Cost Analyzer, textual analysis, and interim updates. This module includes several prices, wages, and costs primarily for the United States with selected coverage for Canada and Mexico. Sector coverage includes energy, labor, steel, nonferrous metals, petrochemicals, building materials, machinery and equipment, transportation services, as well as paper and packaging, among others. Modeling approach is based upon theory that price escalation follows a base path dictated by changes in production costs (materials, energy, labor) with supply-side influences on price formation traced from crude materials, to intermediate materials, and finally to finished goods; demand-side considerations (e.g. periods of high or low demand) are included in the modeling specification and help explain price movements caused by deviations in the base price path established by production cost. The full detail of these forecasts and historical data updates will be provided on a quarterly basis.</p>
<p>Provide access to electronic databases and publications installed on the server at its facilities and made available through its search interface. The interface environments are HTML and Excel. The system is accessed and search results are delivered via the Internet/Web. Access is controlled through passwords for individual users. Authorized users can search and retrieve text on demand, view records on their desktop and download or print items in HTML, Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and PDF. Provide individual website accounts; users will have access to all information content within Pricing &amp; Purchasing Service - North American Prices Module including PDF documents, Excel Workbooks, e-mail alerts, webcasts, help facilities, as well as customer, technical, and account management support and product training.</p>
<p>Projections are used to evaluate proposed rates of price and wage escalation as well as to define economic price adjustment clauses in contracts between private sector companies and public sector buyers. Specifically, the forecasts are utilized by public sector price analysts in evaluating forward prices and wages in a multi-year award context, often for very significant procurements, to determine fairness and reasonableness of proposed quotes. Pricing &amp; Purchasing Service - North American Prices Module is also used in supply chain management efforts for quantifying key escalation drivers and risks associated with specific material, energy, and labor purchases, and for optimal timing of buys.</p>
<p>Pricing &amp; Purchasing Service - North American Prices Module shall include prices, wages, and costs primarily for the United States with selected coverage for Canada and Mexico.</p>
<p>All price and wage indicators, with complete history and forecast observations, are available in downloadable Excel workbooks. DataInsight-Web Cost Analyzer enables user to build composite price indices; breakdown price index inputs (labor, materials, energy); examine demand indicators; obtain productivity adjusted price indices. Supply Manager presents projections of the major cost drivers for each industry including fundamentals-prices, costs, demand, productivity, and margins.</p>
<p>Monthly Commodity Price Forecast Update/Briefing, a subset interim forecast updated monthly, provides indication for direction of next fully detailed quarterly forecast update. Weekly Pricing Pulse is a subset historical price tracker updated weekly. Includes weekly and 26-week moving average observations. IHS Global Inc's Industrial Materials Price Index, the GIIMPI, is a weighted average of weekly spot prices for a key collection of globally traded manufacturing inputs: crude oil, ethylene, propylene, benzene, aluminum, copper, nickel, zinc, lead, tin, pulp, lumber, rubber, cotton, wool, para-xylene, steel scrap, dynamic random access memory (DRAMs), and ocean-going freight rates. Selected daily spot prices also provided.</p>

<p>U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) - Office of the Commissioner (OC) - Occupational Health Services (OHS)- Office of Laboratory Safety and Science (OLSS) - Clinical Services</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS/QUOTES - THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE/REQUEST FOR INFORMATION, AND INFORMATION SUBMITTED WILL BE USED FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought/Request for Information (RFI) is for information, planning and market research purposes only and shall not be construed as either a solicitation or obligation on the part of the Food and Drug Administration or its Centers. The purpose of this RFI is to identify small businesses (i.e., Small Businesses, SBA Certified 8(a) Small Businesses, Woman-owned Small Businesses (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Small Businesses, and Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB) that are capable of providing the full range of services described in this RFI and the draft statement of work (SOW). FDA will use this market research information to assess the market's capability to successfully meet FDA OC/OHS's requirements for Clinical Services. FDA welcomes responses from all interested small businesses. FDA does not intend to make a decision or award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise reimburse interested sources for the preparation of any information submitted for FDA's use of such information. FDA reserves the right to contact vendors if additional information is required.</p>
<p>Overview: <br />The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is the nation's primary federal agency responsible protecting and advancing public health. In addition, FDA plays a significant role in the Nation's counterterrorism capability. To perform these duties, FDA employs attorneys, biologists, chemists, computer specialists, consumer safety officers, engineers, medical officers, pharmacists, statisticians, and administrative personnel. The FDA headquarters is located on the 130-acre White Oak campus. There are multiple field locations located throughout the US and overseas. The Agency has six product-oriented centers in addition to a worldwide field force to carry out its mission. The FDA encounters environmental, sociological, and occupational health matters like those found on the campuses of major universities.</p>
<p>Through Occupational Health Services (OHS), the Office of Laboratory Safety and Science (OLSS) provides a comprehensive medical program for employees, visitors, and guest workers of the FDA per 29 CFR Part 1910 and 1960.80. These services include emergency/urgent medical care, work-related medical evaluations, medical care for occupational injuries and illnesses, work-related travel medical support, health surveillance programs (including immunizations), and employee counseling services. Moreover, the OLSS provides leadership in the development and implementation of occupational health and safety policies, standards, and procedures designed to create, promote, and support a safe and healthful research and regulatory environment. The OLSS encompasses both the Office of the Director and Employee Safety and Environmental Management Staff. While the operations of the OHS clinics are conducted by contract, occupational medical health and surveillance are an integral part of OLSS.</p>
<p>Occupational Health Services supports approximately 25,000 FDA employees, including contractors. Approximately 16,000 employees, roughly 55 percent of the FDA workforce are located in the National Capital Region. The remaining approximate 9,000 employees are located at FDA laboratories and field offices throughout the country and across the world. These field locations include the National Center for Toxicology Research (in Arkansas), over 200 hundred field offices of the Office of Regulatory Affairs, and multiple laboratory facilities.</p>
<p>Currently, occupational health services are provided for FDA employees through an Interagency Agreement (IAA); the Chief Medical Officer, Occupational Health Services is the Technical Expert for this IAA. There are 298 Health and Wellness Centers located in Federal buildings throughout the United States as well as a large network of more than 15,000 private-provider physicians and nurses. Federal Occupational Health operates the Health and Wellness Centers as well as five FDA Occupational Health Units in the National Capital Region (NCR). The clinical staff in the NCR are provided through a subcontracting agreement. It is expected that this new contract will increase operational and management efficiencies and thereby improve current provision of occupational health services.<br />The Food and Drug Administration requires clinical services to FDA/OC/OHS/OLSS to achieve the following objectives: Efficiently sustain the workplace health and safety of FDA employees; Provide occupational health and clinical services, counseling, and training to FDA employees, and guest workers at the National Capital Region Health Units and at all FDA field locations nationwide and internationally; Comply with occupational health and safety regulatory requirements and guidelines; and Maintain a high-level of employee satisfaction with the clinical services received.</p>
<p>The FDA seeks to acquire contractor support to provide all necessary personnel and management to conduct a comprehensive occupational medical program for the FDA. Specifically, the FDA seeks contractor support in sustaining the workplace health and safety of all FDA employees through provision of occupational health services (e.g. counseling, and training).</p>
<p>It is the Government's intention to award a five (5) year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.</p>

<CONTACT>Lisa L. Schaupp, Contract Specialist, Phone 3014020735, Email Lisa.Schaupp@nih.gov
<DESC><p>The National Institutes of Health ("NIH"), Clinical Center is conducting a market survey/sources sought notice to determine whether there is a reasonable expectation of a responsible/capable offeror to provide a High Density Pharmacy Storage and Inventory Management System with, at least, the characteristics listed below. Accordingly, NIH is hoping that there exists a reasonable expectation of at least two responsible/capable offerors in order for NIH to compete the requirement. Additionally, NIH is attempting to ascertain if there exists a reasonable expectation of at least two responsible/capable small business offerors in order for NIH to compete the requirement as a small business set aside.</p>
<p>Accordingly, NIH is seeking capability statements as to the attached SOW from other-than-small businesses, small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service disabled veteran-owned small businesses, HUBZONE small businesses, small businesses under the 8(a) program, and/or businesses under the GSA Schedule capable of providing a system with the following performance characteristics.</p>
<p>The High Density Pharmacy Storage and Inventory Management System must be capable of providing the following. See attached Statement Of Work for more details.</p>
<p>1. The Contractor shall provide a non-developmental Automated Storage System capable of storing high density medications and supplies that will operate as a single integrated solution. The solution shall use a commercial off the shelf software and hardware component that are configurable to the NIH Clinical Center workflow. The solution must have been demonstrated and proven to be in use at another inpatient pharmacy hospital setting. <br />2. The solution shall fit into the pharmacy. Any changes needed/required to accommodate the vendors quoted solution such as the relocation of current fixed shelving/furniture in existing space or addition of dedicated power lines, must be quoted as part of vendors solution and will be considered normal installation. Vendors are responsible for verifying all dimensions and other design features necessary for operation and installation of their quoted solution.<br />3. The solution shall interface with the clean room pharmacy to support access from the clean room.<br />4. The hardware component shall be capable of withstanding a 60 second loss of utility power with no loss of data and no manual intervention to recover.<br />5. The automated storage system shall be able to store at minimum 4 commercial medication items per storage unit with the option to expand storage capabilities.<br />6. The pharmacy automation solution shall use wireless barcode scanning as a means of medication and patient validation throughout the stocking, filling, dispensing and returning to stock process. <br />7. The solution shall support both non-IV and non-narcotic formulary in variety of form factors such as individual packets, cups, syringes, vials, blisters. <br />8. The solution shall have the ability to store narcotic and refrigerated formulary.<br />9. The solution shall have the capability to store non medication items such as supplies for the IV room.<br />10. The storage system shall be capable of storing investigational drugs at controlled room temperature.<br />11. The system shall be capable of ensuring that earliest expiring medications are dispensed first.<br />12. The pharmacy automation solution shall interface with the Allscripts EHR, Omnicell ADCs, inventory Management System and other commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) pharmacy systems. Loss of the interface with EHR shall not impede the system from continuing to fill orders until all orders that have already been transferred are completed.<br />13. When dispensing medication from the storage unit, the pharmacy automated storage solution shall <br />2.13.1 Be capable of using and displaying multiple unique patient identifiers.<br />2.13.2 Print a label to be affixed to the medications to be restocked in the ADC.<br />2.13.3 Use software to fill products not in the automated storage, including, but not limited to fluid bags and irregular dosage forms.<br />2.13.4 Automatically notify user if the automation does not have enough quantity to fulfill the entire order and provide the user option to replenish the automation or divert the order to manual fulfillment based on defined par, max, min and critical levels.</p>

ALTHOUGH A RESPONDENT CAN RESPOND WITH WHATEVER INFORMATION THE RESPONDENT SEES FIT, THE IDEAL CAPABILITY STATEMENT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES THE REQUIREMENTS IN THE SOW AND THE REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION BELOW, AND IS NOT A GENERIC SALES BROCHURE OR MARKETING HANDOUT. FURTHER, THE GOVERNMENT REQUESTS, BUT DOES NOT MANDATE, THAT THE CAPABILITY STATEMENT IS LIMITED TO NO MORE THAN TEN PAGES. ANY PROPRIETARY INFORMATION IN THE SUBMITTED CAPABILITY STATEMENT SHOULD BE CLEARLY MARKED AS SUCH.</p>
<p>The information obtained from this market research is for Government planning purposes only, and will assist the Government in planning its acquisition strategy. This is strictly market research, and the Government is not opening a question and answer period concerning this market research. Further, the Government will not pay for any costs incurred in the preparation of information in response to this market survey.</p>
<p>In addition to addressing the requirements listed above, the Government requests that your capability statement address the following requests for information, if relevant.</p>
<p>1) Please provide the full company/entity name, address including points of contact (phone number and e-mail address), DUNS numbers, and type/size of the company/entity by NAICS code.</p>
<p>2) If your company/entity is a dealer or service-provider, and not a manufacturer of the end items/products contemplated by the SOW, please identify your company as such and identify the end item/product manufacturers that you would be obtaining goods from in order to perform the contract, and where the manufacturers are geographically located.</p>
<p>3) According to the small business limitations on subcontracting standard provided by the amended Small Business Act at 15 U.S.C. &sect; 657s, the requirement for a small business supplier is that the small business prime contractor "may not expend on subcontractors more than 50 percent of the amount, less the cost of materials, paid to the concern under the contract . . . ." 15 U.S.C. &sect; 657s(a)(2). However, "[c]ontract amounts expended by a covered small business concern on a subcontractor that is a similarly situated entity [(i.e., another small/small disadvantaged business of the same type)] shall not be considered subcontracted for purposes of determining whether the covered small business concern has violated [limitations on subcontracting.]" 15 U.S.C. &sect; 657s(b). If you are a small business, please address your ability to adhere to limitations on subcontracting at 15 U.S.C. &sect; 657s.

<DESC>NOTE: This Sources Sought/Request for Information is also posted under NAICS Codes (336611 and 541330) in order to reach all interested parties.  Only one response is necessary for this announcement.  This notice is for market research purposes only and does NOT constitute a request for proposal.  This notice shall not be construed as a contract, a promise to contract, or as a commitment of any kind by the Government.  The Government is NOT seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.
<p>This Sources Sought/Request for Information (RFI) notice is issued by the Department of the Navy, Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA), Program Executive Office (PEO) Unmanned and Small Combatants (USC), Unmanned Maritime Systems Program Office (PMS 406).  The Navy is conducting market research in accordance with FAR Part 10 to determine if sources exist that are capable of satisfying the Navy's anticipated program requirement for independently deploying Medium Unmanned Surface Vehicles (MUSVs).  MUSVs are defined as vessels between 12 and 50 meters in length.  NAVSEA is taking an accelerated approach with industry to leverage existing, manned or unmanned surface ship designs that can be designed and/or modified to rapidly deliver an unmanned surface ship capability.</p>
<p>In accordance with 10 U.S.C. Section 7309, no major component of the hull or superstructure of the MUSV may be constructed in a foreign shipyard.</p>

<p>The objective of this RFI is to assess industry's ability to provide a materiel solution within an accelerated timeframe at an affordable cost.  The Navy is seeking information to help determine the interest, technical and manufacturing capabilities, technical quality of solutions, knowledge, experience level, and qualifications of industry to meet the Government's needs to develop and build a MUSV.  Additionally, the Navy is interested in technical, administrative, and business risks in pursuit of the desired solution.  The Navy has not yet determined the acquisition approach to MUSV.  NAVSEA issues this RFI to obtain industry input to support the Navy's Unmanned Maritime Systems Program Office (PMS 406) within Program Executive Office Unmanned and Small Combatants.  Respondents should identify their materiel solutions, as well as the cost drivers and timeframe, for providing those solutions.  Solutions that only cover a portion of the desired end product are welcome.  It is expected that some unmanned surface vehicle solutions will require modifications to support Navy payloads to be specified at a later date.  Navy is seeking the following in response to this RFI:</p>
<p>1.	What already designed and/or fielded vessels are available as a basis for design of a MUSV?</p>
<p>2.	What technically mature systems/subsystems are available to meet the needs of MUSV? What is the manufacturing capacity and timeline to build a new vessel if applicable?  What is the availability of existing vessels that can be repurposed for this mission if applicable?  What is the manufacturing capacity and timeline to modify an existing vessel to become compliant with desired requirements if applicable?</p>
<p>3.	What is the time frame for each of the following:</p>
<p>a.	Design of MUSV to incorporate a defined payload (with given Size, Weight, Power and Cooling requirements), fabrication of MUSV, contractor test of MUSV, and integration of future payloads after MUSV design is complete.  Include suggested methodologies enabling:</p>
<p>1)	program streamlining and acceleration<br />2)	manufacturing strategies, technologies and approaches for increased production and<br />3)	methodologies supporting warranty, vessel upgrade/modification, and maintenance support to the vessel after delivery.<br />b.	Conversion of existing vessels, if available, into a MUSV to incorporate a defined payload (with given Size, Weight, Power and Cooling requirements), contractor test of MUSV, and integration of future payloads after MUSV design is complete. Include suggested methodologies enabling:<br />1)	program streamlining and acceleration <br />2)	manufacturing strategies, technologies and approaches for increased production and<br />3)	methodologies supporting warranty, vessel upgrade/modification, and maintenance support to the vessel after delivery.</p>
<p>4.	If your solution delivers a vessel designed for manned operation, describe how the craft systems lend themselves to automation and/or remote monitoring and operation (i.e. fly by wire, existing monitoring systems, etc.)  If your solution is an autonomy system for a vessel designed for manned operation, or if your solution is an autonomous vessel, describe the autonomy architecture and capabilities.  For both solutions, describe sensory spectrums and associated data streams required to functionally operate the vessel.  Respond for autonomous operation ranging from Human delegated, to Human supervised and finally to Fully Autonomous, with focus to progressing towards the highest level of</p>
<p>5.	Using Cost As an Independent Variable (CAIV), provide matrices (or equivalent) that compare the potential system and subsystems in your approach, technical maturity, performance and schedule trade-offs and risks associated with each system/subsystem.</p>
<p>6.	What are the primary complexity and cost drivers associated with MUSV as they relate to your approach?  Estimate Total rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimate using FY19 dollars for the build of one MUSV.

In particular, express the fifth unit's cost as a fraction of the first unit's cost, or provide a formula expressing the nth unit's cost as a function of first vessel cost and "n", the number of the vessel.</p>
<p>8.	In production, what would be the optimal interval between vessel deliveries for your organization?  How much cost efficiency could be provided to the Government on such a schedule compared to deliveries spaced 12 months apart?</p>
<p>9.	Specify trade space issues/concerns for technical capability, cost, and schedule.</p>
<p>10.	Specify what, if any, damage control systems are available (e.g., dewatering for flooding, inert gas flooding system for firefighting, etc.)</p>

The Threshold number of personnel during temporary manning is four, with an Objective of zero. Respondents are asked to state how many personnel their approaches would take, and which task drives that number.<br />The objective of this RFI is to assess industry's ability to provide a materiel solution within an accelerated timeframe at an affordable cost. The Navy is seeking information to help determine the interest, technical and manufacturing capabilities, technical quality of solutions, knowledge, experience level, and qualifications of industry to meet the Government's needs to develop and build a MUSV. Additionally, the Navy is interested in technical, administrative, and business risks in pursuit of the desired solution. The Navy has not yet determined the acquisition approach to MUSV. NAVSEA issues this RFI to obtain industry input to support the Navy's Unmanned Maritime Systems Program Office (PMS 406) within Program Executive Office Unmanned and Small Combatants. Respondents should identify their materiel solutions, as well as the cost drivers and timeframe, for providing those solutions. Solutions that only cover a portion of the desired end product are welcome. It is expected that some unmanned surface vehicle solutions will require modifications to support Navy payloads to be specified at a later date. Navy is seeking the following in response to this RFI:</p>
<p>1. What already designed and/or fielded vessels are available as a basis for design of a MUSV?</p>
<p>2. What technically mature systems/subsystems are available to meet the needs of MUSV? What is the manufacturing capacity and timeline to build a new vessel if applicable? What is the availability of existing vessels that can be repurposed for this mission if applicable? What is the manufacturing capacity and timeline to modify an existing vessel to become compliant with desired requirements if applicable?</p>
<p>3. What is the time frame for each of the following: <br />a. Design of MUSV to incorporate a defined payload (with given Size, Weight, Power and Cooling requirements), fabrication of MUSV, contractor test of MUSV, and integration of future payloads after MUSV design is complete. Include suggested methodologies enabling:<br />1) program streamlining and acceleration<br />2) manufacturing strategies, technologies and approaches for increased production and<br />3) methodologies supporting warranty, vessel upgrade/modification, and maintenance support to the vessel after delivery.<br />b. Conversion of existing vessels, if available, into a MUSV to incorporate a defined payload (with given Size, Weight, Power and Cooling requirements), contractor test of MUSV, and integration of future payloads after MUSV design is complete. Include suggested methodologies enabling:<br />1) program streamlining and acceleration <br />2) manufacturing strategies, technologies and approaches for increased production and<br />3) methodologies supporting warranty, vessel upgrade/modification, and maintenance support to the vessel after delivery.</p>
<p>4. If your solution delivers a vessel designed for manned operation, describe how the craft systems lend themselves to automation and/or remote monitoring and operation (i.e. fly by wire, existing monitoring systems, etc.) If your solution is an autonomy system for a vessel designed for manned operation, or if your solution is an autonomous vessel, describe the autonomy architecture and capabilities. For both solutions, describe sensory spectrums and associated data streams required to functionally operate the vessel. Respond for autonomous operation ranging from Human delegated, to Human supervised and finally to Fully Autonomous, with focus to progressing towards the highest level of</p>
<p>5. Using Cost As an Independent Variable (CAIV), provide matrices (or equivalent) that compare the potential system and subsystems in your approach, technical maturity, performance and schedule trade-offs and risks associated with each system/subsystem.</p>
<p>6. What are the primary complexity and cost drivers associated with MUSV as they relate to your approach? Estimate Total rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimate using FY19 dollars for the build of one MUSV. Please provide your basis for cost as follows: Recurring and Non-recurring Costs (including design), and first unit cost. If providing recommended sparing, logistics, and sustainment costs, break these out as separate items.</p>
<p>7. Describe your expected labor learning curve in serial production of MUSV. In particular, express the fifth unit's cost as a fraction of the first unit's cost, or provide a formula expressing the nth unit's cost as a function of first vessel cost and "n", the number of the vessel.</p>
<p>8. In production, what would be the optimal interval between vessel deliveries for your organization? How much cost efficiency could be provided to the Government on such a schedule compared to deliveries spaced 12 months</p>
<p>apart? <br />9. Specify trade space issues/concerns for technical capability, cost, and schedule.</p>
<p>10. Specify what, if any, damage control systems are available (e.g., dewatering for flooding, inert gas flooding system for firefighting, etc.)</p>
<p>11. Describe a logistics support strategy which could include contractor support for the initial craft in theatre for up to two years.</p>

<p>b. ISR repairs may require the Contractor to dispatch personnel as a contractor field service team (CFT) to perform aircraft ISR throughout the east Pacific region, and other areas as required, without impacting PMI event turn-around times (TAT).</p>
<p>4) Aircraft Modifications <br />a. Aircraft modifications (e.g. technical directives, airframe changes, etc.) shall be accomplished either concurrently with PMI events or as standalone actions.</p>

<DESC><br />REQUESTING SOURCES SOUGHT AND CAPABILITY STATEMENTS
<p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. This is not a request for offers, quotes or proposals. This notice does not represent a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or award a contract. This is a market research tool only to determine the capability of potential sources.</p>
<p>The Office of Inspector General (HUD OIG) Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is contemplating establishing a contract under NAICS Code(s) 511210 for Software Publishers, 519120 for Libraries and Archives, 519130 for Internet Publishing and Broadcasting and Web Search Portals. The Small Business Standards are $38,500,000.00, #1,000, and $15,000,000.00 respectively. PSC Codes would be Information Technology 7030 and/or R702 Data Collection and/or R605 Library. The services/product required is a primarily online data aggregation, indexing, and investigative platform. HUD OIG is issuing this Request For Information (RFI) in order to solicit responses from capable sources and capability statements to ensure sufficient competition exists to meet the government's requirements. <br /><br />Teaming arrangements and joint ventures will be considered for any subsequent procurement based on the Government's market research, provided that all ventures are appropriately balanced between large / small offerors in accordance with an applicable SBA regulations and HUD / HUD OIG policy.<br /><br />Please review the Draft Requirements below and provide your feedback, responses, and questions to Robert Coyle at Rcoyle@hudoig.gov. <br /><br /><br /><strong>So, what exactly is HUD OIG contemplating acquiring? </strong></p>
<p>BACKGROUND<br />HUD OIG has a continuing requirement for access to investigative databases that allow HUD OIG personnel to query a wide variety of information sources with related applicable search/reporting toolsets and functions in support of their investigations, audits, and Law Enforcement efforts.<br /><br />HUD OIG currently utilizes Lexis Nexus's Accurint tool, which expires in the Second Quarter FY 19, barring continuation. As part of a broader look at HUD OIGs IT and Investigative capabilities and resources, HUD OIG is looking to update and or replace its current capabilities with a single unified support contract that will effectively address the needs of all its offices (OI, OA, and OE), which has proved difficult in the past. <br /><br />GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF WORK<br />HUD OIG is seeking a primarily online solution with some offline capabilities, that can support a wide variety of law enforcement activities. The attached excel file FY19 Desired Capabilities.xlsx lists the areas HUD OIG is interested in, though HUD OIG understands that not all capabilities are likely to be available, sometimes due to technological feasibility, sometimes due to limitations of primary sources/regulations. <br /><br />CONTEMPLATED PERFORMANCE METRICS<br />Metrics under consideration are:<br />&bull; Frequency of Updates to Data Sources<br />&bull; Time to initial response for Help Desk support<br />&bull; Time to final resolution for Help Desk Support<br /><br />CONTEMPLATED REPORT REQUIREMENTS<br />&bull; Reporting Requirements are anticipated on a Monthly Basis, to include basic user metrics, queries, support request numbers, and etc as related to Performance Metrics</p>
<p>CONTEMPLATED MAGNITUDE OF THE PROJECT<br />Under $500,000.00<br /><br />CONTEMPLATED PLACE OF PERFORMANCE<br />Online, with use across CONUS and OCONUS (US Territories and States)<br /><br />RESPONSE REQUESTED<br /><br />Small Businesses are encouraged to respond.<br /><br />This synopsis is a market research tool being used to determine the availability and capability of potential sources prior to determining the method of acquisition and whether the government will proceed with this acquisition. The Government will not pay for any information solicited. If a contract is ultimately pursued, responses to this synopsis will be used to aid in determining whether the acquisition is set-aside for small business or in establishing small business subcontracting goals. All qualified firms are encouraged to respond. <br /><br />The capability statement shall address, at a minimum, the following for the past three years:<br /><br />1. Name and address of company and or companies (if there is a teaming arrangement or joint venture);<br /><br />2. Technical expertise relevant to the requirement;<br /><br />3. Technical approach relevant of the requirement (1 to 2 paragraphs);<br /><br />4. Management approach relevant to the requirement (1 to 2 paragraph);<br /><br />5. Corporate experience relevant to the requirement (1 to 2 paragraph);<br /><br />6. Indicate if you are a small business or any other socio-economic categories that apply to your firm under the designated NAICS code;<br /><br />7. Whether you have had unequal access to any information relevant to the acquisition that could provide an unfair competitive advantage; <br /><br />8. Relevant past performance. Your capability statement needs to include a list of three customers (Government/non-Government) within the past three (3) years highlighting similar work in nature, scope, complexity, and difficulty and a brief description of the scope of work.

<p>9. Interested firms shall indicate whether they are interested in providing a one hour demo to HUD OIG staff, at HUD OIG HQ. Please note that an answer in the affirmative does not require HUD OIG to accept.</p>
<p>10. Interested firms shall indicate whether they are interested in providing a trial of their product to HUD OIG for a one to two week period, to allow HUD OIG staff to review parties capabilities first hand. Providing a trial will require entering into a no cost trial agreement, and interested parties shall state what they are willing to authorize/allow. Please note that an answer in the affirmative does not require HUD OIG to accept.</p>
<p>11. Interested firms shall indicate what, if any, schedules or contract vehicles are available on. <br /><br /><br /><br />Interested firms responding to this market survey must provide a capability statement demonstrating their experience, skills and capability to fulfill the Governments requirements for the above.

Citations to pertinent laws, codes and regulations such as 44 U.S.C chapters 21, 29, 31 and 33; Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552); Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a); 36 CFR Part 1222 and Part 1228.
Contractor shall treat all deliverables under the contract as the property of the U.S. Government for which the Government Agency shall have unlimited rights to use, dispose of, or disclose such data contained therein as it determines to be in the public interest. 
Contractor shall not create or maintain any records that are not specifically tied to or authorized by the contract using Government IT equipment and/or Government records. 
Contractor shall not retain, use, sell, or disseminate copies of any deliverable that contains information covered by the Privacy Act of 1974 or that which is generally protected by the Freedom of Information Act. 
Contractor shall not create or maintain any records containing any Government Agency records that are not specifically tied to or authorized by the contract. 
The Government Agency owns the rights to all data/records produced as part of this contract. 
The Government Agency owns the rights to all electronic information (electronic data, electronic information systems, electronic databases, etc.) and all supporting documentation created as part of this contract. Contractor must deliver sufficient technical documentation with all data deliverables to permit the agency to use the data. 
Contractor agrees to comply with Federal and Agency records management policies, including those policies associated with the safeguarding of records covered by the Privacy Act of 1974.

The Contractor (and any sub-contractor) is required to abide by Government and Agency guidance for protecting sensitive and proprietary information. 

VA INFORMATION AND INFORMATION SYSTEM SECURITY/PRIVACY LANGUAGE FOR INCLUSION INTO CONTRACTS, AS APPROPRIATE
GENERAL

Contractors, contractor personnel, subcontractors, and subcontractor personnel shall be subject to the same Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks as VA and VA personnel regarding information and information system security.

ACCESS to VA INFORMATION AND VA INFORMATION SYSTEMS

A contractor/subcontractor shall request logical (technical) or physical access to VA information and VA information systems for their employees, subcontractors, and affiliates only to the extent necessary to perform the services specified in the contract, agreement, or task order.

All contractors, subcontractors, and third-party servicers and associates working with VA information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of VA appointees or employees who have access to the same types of information.  The level and process of background security investigations for contractors must be in accordance with VA Directive and Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program.  The Office for Operations, Security, and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures.

Contract personnel who require access to national security programs must have a valid security clearance.  National Industrial Security Program (NISP) was established by Executive Order 12829 to ensure that cleared U.S. defense industry contract personnel safeguard the classified information in their possession while performing work on contracts, programs, bids, or research and development efforts.  The Department of Veterans Affairs does not have a Memorandum of Agreement with Defense Security Service (DSS).  Verification of a Security Clearance must be processed through the Special Security Officer located in the Planning and National Security Service within the Office of Operations, Security, and Preparedness.

Custom software development and outsourced operations must be located in the U.S. to the maximum extent practical.  If such services are proposed to be performed abroad and are not disallowed by other VA policy or mandates, the contractor/subcontractor must state where all non-U.S. services are provided and detail a security plan, deemed to be acceptable by VA, specifically to address mitigation of the resulting problems of communication, control, data protection, and so forth.  Location within the U.S. may be an evaluation factor.

The contractor or subcontractor must notify the Contracting Officer immediately when an employee working on a VA system or with access to VA information is reassigned or leaves the contractor or subcontractor s employ.  The Contracting Officer must also be notified immediately by the contractor or subcontractor prior to an unfriendly termination.

SECURITY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION

The term  security incident  means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures.  The contractor/subcontractor shall immediately notify the POC and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor/subcontractor has access.

To the extent known by the contractor/subcontractor, the contractor/subcontractor s notice to VA shall identify the information involved, the circumstances surrounding the incident (including to whom, how, when, and where the VA information or assets were placed at risk or compromised), and any other information that the contractor/subcontractor considers relevant.

With respect to unsecured protected health information, the business associate is deemed to have discovered a data breach when the business associate knew or should have known of a breach of such information.  Upon discovery, the business associate must notify the covered entity of the breach.  Notifications need to be made in accordance with the executed business associate agreement.

In instances of theft or break-in or other criminal activity, the contractor/subcontractor must concurrently report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement entity (or entities) of jurisdiction, including the VA OIG and Security and Law Enforcement.  The contractor, its employees, and its subcontractors and their employees shall cooperate with VA and any law enforcement authority responsible for the investigation and prosecution of any possible criminal law violation(s) associated with any incident.  The contractor/subcontractor shall cooperate with VA in any civil litigation to recover VA information, obtain monetary or other compensation from a third party for damages arising from any incident, or obtain injunctive relief against any third party arising from, or related to, the incident.

<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Directorate of Procurement is considering an increase to the value and an ordering period extension of the Special Operations Personal Equipment Advanced Requirements Tactical Stand-Alone (SPEAR TSA) &amp; Modular Supplemental Armor Protection (MSAP) Ballistic Plate contract H92222-14-D-0061, awarded to Leading Technology Composites (LTC) after a competitive small business set-aside source selection in September 2014. A ceiling increase of $50M and an ordering period extension to November 2020 is anticipated to meet component requirements for life-saving equipment and allow ample time to complete the competitive source selection for the follow-on contract. The original ceiling and ordering period was established based upon operational requirements assessed at the time of award. Due to operational events and unforeseen additional customers, the demand for this capability has increased substantially. Furthermore, based upon actuals, the timeline from market research to award is approximately 24 months. Many of the re-compete activities are underway with the anticipated award date in late 2020. Lastly, a reactive source selection for this requirement is not pragmatic due to the Production Demonstration Models prerequisite for evaluation and the current unprecedented delays in the raw material availability throughout the body armor industry. The current Critical to National Defense (DO) rated requirements are being delayed considerably across the Department. In accordance with the Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS), PDMs are considered unrated orders and, therefore, a lower priority than the current DO orders. Consequently, to expect short notice PDMs for a source selection with immediate product delivery upon award is impractical and would certainly result in unacceptable delays with extensive duplication of costs. All questions and comments regarding this matter should be directed to Capt Matthew Albers at Matthew.Albers@socom.mil.

<CONTACT>Christy H. McKethan, ESD Contract Specialist, Phone 2523356072, Email Christy.H.McKethan@uscg.mil
<DESC>Event: Real Time Parts Tracking Industry Day
<p>Sponsor: Aviation Logistics Center (ALC) Business Operations Division (BOD)</p>
<p>Background: <br />The United States Coast Guard (USCG), ALC is conducting market research to determine feasibility of receiving commercial contractor-furnished resources for the procurement of real time parts tracking. The current system is not Windows 10 compatible and is downloaded to the network at the conclusion of the workday. It utilizes a barcode scanner that up to four (4) artisans are using daily. Parts movement needs to be tracked between the manufacturing and repair facility on base to the various product lines and warehouse. The proposed system must be able to wirelessly transmit parts movement and locations to a centralized Windows 10 compatible web based platform that will be accessible from 40 users daily. The network connection on base for wireless devices is Wi-Fi based, but we would be open to cellular access also that does not connect directly to the Coast Guard network. We prefer a barcode scanner system as opposed to Radio Frequency Identification Device (RFID) tags since our current parts inventory system utilizes barcoding.</p>
<p>To facilitate planning, ALC will host an Industry Day, November 7th. The location will be USCG, ALC, Heavy Maintenance Facility, Training Room 4. The Industry Day will consist of a review of the USCG's minimum requirements and a question and answer period. Each company will be given 30 minutes to present their product to the USCG one-on-one. Although the Industry Day (site visit) is not required, it is strongly encouraged. The event is part of ALC's market research that will be used to identify potential solutions to ultimately determine an optimal sourcing strategy. Contractors must register to attend this event. Interested parties shall submit the attached registration questionnaire no later than October 31, 2018. Base access will not be granted without this information. Directions to USCG Base Elizabeth City can be found at http://www.uscg.mil/alc/directions.</p>
<p>The applicable North American Industrial Classification Code (NAICS) 488190 and the small business is $32.5M. Responses are due no later than October 31, 2018 and may be submitted via email to Christy.H.McKethan@uscg.mil. Questions concerning this Industry Day notification may be directed to Christy McKethan at Christy.H.McKethan@uscg.mil. Respondents are advised that the USCG will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this Industry Day notification including participation.</p>
<p>Who Should Attend: <br />Attendance is limited to companies with demonstrated expertise in the design and installation of real time parts tracking. Prior federal contracting experience is not required.</p>
<p>Registration: Please limit the number of attendees from your company to two (2) people.</p>
<p>There is no cost to attend this event. There will be no refreshments served at this event.</p>
<p>Registration will close at October 31, 2018.</p>
<p>Day of Event: Onsite registration will begin at 0815. Please allow 15 minutes for security screening required to enter USCG Base Elizabeth City. This event is open to U.S. citizens only. Government issued photo ID (i.e. driver's license) will be required for admittance.</p>

Critical Value.  A test result that requires evaluation by a physician or other health care provider as soon as verified.  Failure to take appropriate action as a result of a critical value might cause harm or undue suffering for a patient.  A list of critical values is to be made available to each VA facility upon request.
Frozen Section.  A biopsy specimen that is immediately frozen and cut with cryostat; then mounted on a slide, stained, and examined by a pathologist.  Frozen sections provide a rapid diagnosis to the physician during surgery.
Paraffin Block.  A tissue specimen that has been embedded in paraffin wax that the sections can be cut for histologic examination. 
Reference or Referral Laboratory.  The contract laboratory that provides testing, and examination of specimens provided by the medical treatment facility.
Reference Value.  A range of test values expected for a designated population of individuals.
Slides. Glass surface containing biological material to be analyzed.
Specimen.  A body fluid or tissue sample removed for medical examination and analytical testing.
STAT.  A designated category of tests that requires immediate processing to expedite results to physicians handling potentially life-threatening cases.
Surgical Specimen.  A sample or part of an organ or tissue removed during surgery for medical examination and analytical testing.
Tests.  Diagnostic assays to evaluate a patient's physiological condition.
Routine Test - A test that is usually performed at high volume in which the result is required in 24 hours generally.
Specialized Test - A test that is performed in low volume but the technology, expense, or time-consuming nature of each test, is such that some delay is expected.  However, results should be received within a reasonable amount of time to meet patient care needs. The delay usually occurs to allow tests received from different enters to be batch to make the operation cost-effected.
Esoteric Test - A test that is similar to specialized tests, except they can only be done in a few laboratories throughout the country.
TAT - The length of elapsed time between pick-up or dispatch of specimen from the contractor s laboratory until the receipt of the completed printed/ electronically transmitted report back in the lab. These definitions apply whether the contractor or a subcontractor performs the test.
Special handling - Unusual circumstances may dictate the need for a specimen to be picked up, run out of sequence at a special time, or reported within a shorter than usual time.
Overflow - A test usually performed in the VAMC lab, which might be referred to the contractor s laboratory in case of instrument breakdown or other circumstances interfering with the VAMC s ability to analyze the specimens.
Proficiency Testing - An assessment of the accuracy of testing by a laboratory based on the analysis of an unknown specimen analyzed by a large number of other labs.  The proficiency survey is conducted by an organization or agency authorized by the Department of Health and Human Services to do so.

<SOLNBR>FA8604-18-R-4025
<RESPDATE>061518
<CONTACT>Doug Rogers, Program Manager, Email douglas.rogers.7@us.af.mil
<DESC>High Energy Laser (HEL) Flexible Prototype <br />Request for Information (RFI)
<p>1.0 Description</p>
<p>1.1 The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) is interested in rapid demonstration and verification of a laser weapon system (LWS) in a realistic operating environment for potential future integration with an airborne vehicle. Responses to this RFI should provide evidence of demonstrated LWS potential for military utility. AFLCMC requests estimates of costs and time required to complete any remaining development, subsystem level testing, system level integration, and integrated system-level ground testing. This information will be used by AFLCMC as market research and as a basis to assess the feasibility, cost, schedule and risk associated with an airborne HEL Flexible Prototype program.</p>
<p>1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This RFI does not commit the U.S. Government to contract for any supply or service. Moreover, the AFLCMC is not seeking proposals at this time, and it will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the respondent party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if issued.</p>
<p>2.0 Background</p>
<p>2.1 For the purposes of rapid demonstration and verification, the Air Force would prefer a non-developmental LWS suitable for airborne applications. In May 2017, Eglin AFB released the "Airborne Tactical Laser Technology" RFI, and those responses have been reviewed. For the purposes of planning timelines for this HEL Flexible Prototype RFI response, assume a 12 month schedule constraint from the time of contract award for integration to system level ground test verification of a LWS. The success of meeting this schedule milestone is the primary factor for continued work toward the flying prototype and the possibility of future LWS production.</p>
<p>2.2 The government will provide a classified RFI addendum to describe specific uses to all qualified vendors. The RFI addendum is classified SECRET. Interested parties must provide an appropriately cleared point of contact and a classified, preferably SIPRNET, email address to receive the addendum. Send requests to: Program Manager, Doug Rogers (<strong>douglas.m.rogers6.civ@mail.smil.mil</strong>) and Technology Protection Lead, Chaun Edwards (<strong>chaun.l.edwards.civ@mail.smil.mil</strong>).</p>
<p>2.3 Security Requirements: While this RFI is unclassified, responses may be either unclassified or classified up to the SECRET level.</p>
<p>3.0 Requested Information</p>
<p>3.1 Provide an RFI response that clearly documents all applicable previous and current development, testing, and operational use of LWS technology potentially suitable for operations in a flight environment.</p>
<p>3.2 Describe your definition of a LWS as it pertains to the information provided in the RFI addendum. Furthermore, provide estimates of DoD Defense Acquisition Guidebook based technology readiness levels (TRL) of essential LWS subsystems and attributes pertinent to the use cases in the RFI addendum. Include subsystems and attributes such as but not limited to: cooling, electrical power, laser, beam control, battle management, irradiance at range, power level achievable, power requirements, engagement range, duty cycle, fire-control (find/fix/track of designated target), energy storage, computing, command &amp; control, jitter mitigation, environmental requirements, atmospheric attenuation, weight, volume, and beam wavelength/bandwidth, and airborne platform integration/interface requirements.</p>
<p>3.3 The government is interested in understanding cost, schedule, performance, and risk of each LWS concept submitted. Cost estimates are assumed to be in 2018 dollars unless indicated otherwise.</p>
<p>3.4 Provide a DoD Defense Acquisition Guidebook based TRL estimate of an integrated ground test ready LWS.</p>
<p>4.0 Responses</p>
<p>4.1 Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI with a white paper not to exceed 20 pages using 12 point Times New Roman font. White papers are <strong>due no later than 15 June 2018, 1700 Eastern Time</strong>. Unclassified responses shall be submitted via secure e-mail or secure website only to the Program Manager, Doug Rogers (<strong>douglas.rogers.7@us.af.mil</strong>) and the Lead Engineer, Maj Adam Tobias (<strong>adam.tobias@us.af.mil</strong>). Classified responses shall be submitted via SIPRNET e-mail to Doug Rogers (<strong>douglas.m.rogers6.civ@mail.smil.mil</strong>) and Chaun Edwards (<strong>chaun.l.edwards.civ@mail.smil.mil</strong>). Interested parties shall follow the instructions below regarding how to deliver the white paper response package content. RFI responses shall be organized into two separate sections as outlined below.</p>
<p>4.1.1 Section 1 of the white paper response shall provide administrative information, and shall include the following as a minimum:</p>
<p>4.1.1.a Company name, mailing address, overnight delivery address (if different from mailing address), CAGE code, phone number, fax number, and e-mail of designated point of contact. Respondents are further requested to indicate their Foreign Ownership, Control or Influence (FOCI) status, if applicable.</p>
<p>4.1.1.b A statement stipulating the submitter's desired distribution of the white paper.</p>
<p>4.1.2 Section 2 of the white paper shall address the information requested in Section 3.0 of this RFI. Proprietary information, if any, MUST BE CLEARLY MARKED. Please be advised that all submissions become government property and will not be returned. Only government employees will review submitted responses to this RFI. Respondents are advised that employees of commercial firms under contract with the government may be used to administratively process submissions and perform other administrative duties requiring access to other contractor's proprietary information. These administrative support contracts include nondisclosure agreements prohibiting contractor employees from disclosing any information submitted by other contractors or using such information for any purpose other than that for which it was furnished.</p>
<p>5.0 Industry Discussion</p>
<p>Government representatives may or may not choose to hold an Industry Day or meet with respondents after white papers are submitted. Such discussions, if desired, will be scheduled by government invitation directly with individual respondents and based on compelling responses to this RFI. The intent of any such discussions would only be to obtain additional clarification of potential capabilities to meet government requirements and further expose risks (especially development risks).</p>
<p>6.0 Questions</p>
<p>Questions regarding this announcement shall be submitted in writing via e-mail to the Program Manager, Doug Rogers (<strong>douglas.rogers.7@us.af.mil</strong>). Verbal questions will NOT be accepted. Questions will be addressed by posting answers to the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps.gov) website. Accordingly, questions shall NOT contain proprietary or classified information. The government does not guarantee questions received after 15 June 2018, 1700 Eastern Time will be answered.</p>
<p>7.0 Summary</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY to understand industry's available LWS technology. The U.S. Government has made no final solicitation decision regarding eventual procurement or by what means such a solicitation, if any, would be handled (FAR or other transactions). The information provided in this RFI is subject to change and is not binding upon the U.S. Government. The U.S. Government has not made a commitment to procure any of the items discussed, and release of this RFI should not be construed as such a commitment or as authorization to incur costs for which reimbursement would be required or sought. All submissions become U.S. Government property and will not be returned.</p>

<DESC>Synopsis: <br /><br />Announcement.<br /><br />The U.S. Army Network-Cross Functional Team, with Program Executive Office C3T, will host a tactical network related forum to discuss needs for distributed computing (mission command) solutions, including the potential to deliver Cloud services to tactical formations. This Technical Industry Forum will take place from August 1-2, 2018 in Raleigh, North Carolina at the Marriott Raleigh City Center. All persons who wish to attend this forum must register no later than 5:00p.m. (EST) July 20, 2018. Registration is available at this link: <br /><br />https://armytacticalcloudindustryday.eventbrite.com<br /><br />The goal of the event is to assist industry partners and interested government organizations in identifying and aligning their efforts with Army tactical network modernization priorities. This event is meant for a technical audience to include Cloud service providers, systems and software engineers, architecture experts, data analytical experts and integrators. The Army encourages non-defense IT companies to participate in this two day forum, as these companies may have innovative solutions to enable: data analytics, artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, block chain, multi-level security, identity and access management and storage and delivery across Army tactical formations operating in a disconnected, intermitted and limited bandwidth (DIL) environment. <br /><br />The first day will provide an introduction to Army hierarchy and decision making structures in order to enable technical audience members to understand the physical and network environments in which the Army operates. Technical panels will then discuss Army network implementation, management, and constraints in four distributed computing (mission command) related areas: 1. Data Logistics; 2. Infrastructure; 3. Enterprise Service Architecture; 4. Mission Partner Environment. <br />The second day will offer an opportunity for conversation and technical exchange between audience members and Army network technical experts and user community representatives. This day will reseat panel members who will be prepared for conversation exchange on each topic area addressed on day one. This will enable vendors, in an open session, to ask questions for clarification, operational understanding (uniformed operators will be present) and technical understanding. Each topical session will have a moderated panel and will field questions from attendees regarding that topic. At the end of the event, for those interested, the Army will host a &lsquo;doing business with the Army' session for those vendors who would like to understand how to respond to Army solicitations, work with Small Business Offices and explore types of Army contracts that might be employed to seek capability. This session is optional. This information is intended to help scope follow-on white papers and demonstrations resulting from this technical forum. <br /><br /><br />Problem Statement: <br /><br />The U.S. Army seeks to leverage Cloud capabilities within the tactical ecosystem. This tactical compute Cloud will be constrained by a variety of factors that fall into the following categories: Data Logistics, Infrastructure, Enterprise Service Architecture, and Mission Partner Environment. Each of these areas is affected by the operational environment including contested and congested environments, low bandwidth, spectrum denied, and many other factors that preclude traditional cloud solutions. The US Army is seeking capability ideas in the above categories that will meet the needs of the operating force.<br /><br /><br />DRAFT AGENDA: Dress code for both days: Military: Duty Uniform; Civilian: business casual<br /><br />DAY 1<br /><br />0700-0800: Registration/Breakfast <br /><br />0800-0810: Opening remarks<br /><br />0810-0830: Remarks MG Pete Gallagher<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Director, Network CFT <br /><br />0830-0850: Remarks MG Dave Bassett<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PEO C3T<br /><br />0850-0950: "Army 101": Operational Structure Mr. Erik Hanson<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. John Bender<br />Description: Overview of the Army's structure, units, and operating methods. <br /><br />0950-1005: Break<br /><br />1005-1100: "Army 201": The Network Mr. Erik Hanson <br />Description: Overview of the Army's networks and how they relate to the Operational Structure, challenges relating to the network, and what cloud related problems we are asking industry to solve.<br /><br />1100-1130: UPDATE: Mission Command Software Development Kit Mr. Krupal Kapadia, Chief Engineer, product manager Tactical Mission Command <br /><br />1130-1230: LUNCH<br /><br />1230-1330: Topic 1 Panel: Data Logistics <br />Description: Soldiers &amp; Sensors generate mass quantities of data that must be aggregated for analysis at higher echelons; the outcome of which must be transferred as actionable intelligence to the edge of the battlefield.<br /><br />1330-1430: Topic 2 Panel: Infrastructure <br />Description: Army Units are not aligned on a single baseline - often requiring units to integrate legacy technology into advantaged environments.

<DESC>NATIONAL ARCHIVES AND RECORDS ADMINISTRATION<br />REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<br />Conservator <br />88310319RFI00001
<p><br />1.0 Introduction</p>
<p>The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) is an independent Federal agency that helps safeguard and preserve our nation's history by overseeing the management of all Federal records. The stories of our nation and our people are told in the records and artifacts cared for in NARA facilities around the country and people can discover, use, and learn from this documentary heritage. The mission is to ensure ready access to the essential evidence that documents the rights of American citizens, the actions of Federal officials, and the national experience.</p>
<p>NARA issues this Request for Information (RFI) package to obtain information regarding conservation services.</p>
<p>This RFI is intended strictly for market research. It is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation. Potential solutions presented may or may not lead to a solicitation. Any decision to proceed with a solicitation would be based, in part, on available funding.</p>
<p>2.0 Description/Objective</p>
<p>NARA requires the services of one (1) conservator to stabilize paper-based records prior to digitization. A range of stabilization treatments will be performed on original War of 1812 Pension and County Land Warrant Application Files, ca. 1871-ca. 1900 to ensure safe handling and full image capture of content during digitization.</p>
<p>On average the Contractor will work approximately 24 hours per week. Fluctuations in schedule shall be decided by mutual agreement between the Contractor and NARA as long as enough files are completed to supply work to the scanning camera operator. To ensure the scanning operation is continual, it is estimated that an average of 39 files per week need to be completed.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall treat approximately 13 files for every eight (8) hours worked or approximately 2,000 files per year (156 days), including necessary treatment documentation. The pace of work will be determined by the condition of the files and a reasonable number of files per hour will be decided by mutual agreement between the Contractor and NARA. The files to be treated shall receive archival preparation before coming to the lab. The preparation staff will tab items that require treatment to permit safe handling during imaging and/or to permit full image capture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Contractor shall perform the following treatments as needed:<br /><br />&#61607; Separation of documents where unique information is obscured <br />&#61607; Mending <br />&#61607; Local humidification<br />&#61607; Surface cleaning<br />&#61607; Removal of prior mends</p>
<p>The Contractor shall ensure that torn documents will be mended using long-fiber tissue and paste, heat set tissue, and/or remoistenable tissue.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall ensure that mends are secure and will not detach when documents are flexed and handled.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall ensure that adhesive attachments are removed with no skinning of the paper, no feathering or bleeding of inks, and no residual tide lines.</p>
<p>See Attachment 1 for images of sample documents requiring treatment.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide conservation treatments in accordance with American Institute for Conservation (AIC) Code of Ethics in a manner consistent with the durability and aesthetic quality of the records. The AIC Code of Ethics can be found at http://www.conservation-us.org/about-us/core-documents/code-of-ethics#.U-O6SFP1u-Q.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the period of performance will be for one base year plus two option years.<br />The conservation work will be performed at NARA's Washington, DC location.</p>
<p>Contractor personnel shall pass a NACI background check to be allowed to work at NARA.</p>

The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-101. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is  443142 with a small business size standard of $32.50M. This requirement is a [ Small Business ] set-aside and only qualified offerors may submit bids.  The solicitation pricing on www.FedBid.com will start on the date this solicitation is posted and will end on 2018-10-24 17:00:00.0 Eastern Time or as otherwise displayed at www.FedBid.com.

It offers a compact external storage chassis capable of accommodating drives with a SAS 12 Gb/s or SATA 6 Gb/s interface. The box can support both 2.5" and 3.5" disk drives, each one contained in a disk carrier. This compact tower provides one 6 Gb/s SFF-8088 SAS and four 12 Gb/s SFF-8644 connections. Out-of-band CLI can be redefined to the manufacture default setting on those connections. Configuration and environmental information are accessible either via in-band (SES-3.0 over SMP) or out-of-band serial port.
The ARC-4038 includes 8 internal plus 20 external SAS 12 Gb/s ports for host and easy expansion. It features SAS and LSI DataBolt bandwidth optimizer technology. This enclosure is compatible with SAS-enabled systems as well as 6 Gb/s drives and backplanes. Using DataBolt, the ARC-4038 buffers 6 Gb/s data and then transfers it out to the host at 12 Gb/s speeds in order to match the bandwidth between faster hosts and slower SAS or SATA devices.
The ARC-4038 contains an embedded expander manager that can access via in-band SES-3.0 over SMP protocol and out-of band RS-232 port. The ARC-4038 expander firmware and EPLD has implemented the SES-3.0 protocol and disk activity map to the individual fault/activity status indicator on the backplanes. It has autonomous chassis management of the power supply status connectors and two fan monitor/speed control connectors through the SES-3.0 protocol. The hardware monitor can keep track of system voltage and temperature as well as offer a warning message via an alarm buzzer and the corresponding LED.
The ARC-1883X PCIe RAID controller offers increased performance and improved enterprise data protection. This low-profile card is equipped with a 1.2 GHz dual-core ROC processor, 2GB of DDR3-1866 memory, and PCIe 3.0 interface. It supports up to 256 drives and provides two SFF-8644 ports. The drives are preconfigured in a single RAID 5 array, providing 70TB of usable storage.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

<p>The solicitation number is W912EQ-19-Q-0004 and is being issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). This procurement is a 100% small business set aside in accordance with FAR Part 19.5 with a North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 811310, and an applicable size standard of $7.5M.</p>
<p>A. The provision at FAR 52.212-1 (Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial) applies to this acquisition.  See the addenda below titled, "Instructions to Offerors".<br />B. The provision at FAR 52.212-2 (Evaluation -- Commercial Items) applies to this procurement.  <br /> <br /> (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>All quotes submitted will be evaluated for (1) Technical Acceptability, (2) Satisfactory Past Performance, and (3) Price. The government will issue award to the Offeror whose quote is the Lowest Price of those determined to meet at least the minimum requirements to be determined technically acceptable &amp; that demonstrates satisfactory past performance.</p>
<p>Submittals; <br />It is incumbent upon the offeror to submit sufficient information for the Government to make a determination of your technical acceptability, satisfactory past performance and price. Failure to submit sufficient information for the government to determine your technical acceptability, satisfactory past performance or price may be cause for rejection of your quote.</p>
<p>(1)	Technical Acceptability - to be determined technically acceptably offerors shall submit for evaluation, documentation of their capability to provide the specified services in accordance with the project Scope-of-Work, including but not limited to, the capability to provide the services specified, and in accordance with the specified delivery schedule.</p>

Past performance information of key personnel and crew may be provided if the company has limited or no past performance. In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will be evaluated as neutral on Past Performance, providing the offeror supplies a certified statement with their offer that no past performance information is available.</p>
<p>The Government's approach to evaluating past performance is to check the references provided by the contractor to verify satisfactory past performance as well as data obtained from other sources available i.e. government database, past contract files, etc. The offeror is cautioned that while the Government will consider data from other sources, the burden of demonstrating satisfactory past performance rests with the offeror.</p>
<p>It is incumbent upon the offeror to submit sufficient documentation and information for the Government to determine technical acceptability, satisfactory past performance and proposed price. Failure to submit sufficient information for the government to determine technical acceptability, past performance or price may be cause for rejection of your quote.</p>
<p>(3) Price - Price quotes will be examined to determine the extent to which proposed prices are comparable with the Government estimates, and previous procurement history and a determination made of Price Reasonableness. The Government may reject any quote that is determined to be Not Fair and Reasonable, unrealistically high or low in price when compared to Government estimates, or are unbalanced, such that the quote is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the requirements. All quotes will be evaluated and a determination made of lowest price, from prices presented on the Bidding Schedule, based on the Total of all line items.</p>
<p><br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. This can be accomplished through informal discussion between the interested party and the Contracting Officer. During the course of such discussions Contracting Officers shall ensure that the Chief of the Contracting Office (COCO) remains informed of all issues and developments as they occur. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns of the interested party, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protest through the Ombudsman Hotline at (202) 372-3695. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirements for filing an agency protest or protest with another forum. <br />Interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

Option 2 - 

This is FAR Part 13 acquisition utilizing Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) procedures.  The Government will
award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government considering price and other factors. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

Technical Capability   The Government will evaluate quotes on the basis of whether or not the offeror provided a signed statement certifying that the quote submitted meets the technical capability specified in the Statement of Work.  Technical Capability shall consist of meeting the technical requirements of the Statement of Work.

Price   The Government will evaluate offers by adding all line item prices - the Total of All CLINS will be that sum. The Government may use various price analysis techniques and procedures to make a price reasonableness determination. Offers that do not meet the technical capability requirements of the Statement of Work shall not be selected regardless of price.

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

(d)  All Offerors are advised that, in the interest of efficiency, the Government reserves the right to conduct the review in the most effective manner.  Specifically, the Government may first sort the quotes of all Offerors by price from lowest price to the highest.  Thereafter, the Government will review the Technical Capability of the lowest priced quote only.  If the lowest priced Offeror s Technical Capability is determined to be acceptable and meets the requirements, the Government may make award to that Offeror without further reviews of the remaining Offerors  Technical Capability.  If the lowest priced Offeror s Technical Capability is determined to not meet the requirement, then the Government may review the Technical Capability next lowest priced quote, and so on, until the Government reaches a quote that is determined to meet the Technical Capability requirements.

This is FAR Part 13 acquisition utilizing Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) procedures.  The Government will
award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government considering price and other factors. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

Technical Capability   The Government will evaluate quotes on the basis of whether or not the offeror provided a signed statement certifying that the quote submitted meets the technical capability specified in the Statement of Work.  Technical Capability shall consist of meeting the technical requirements of the Statement of Work.

Price   The Government will evaluate offers by adding all line item prices - the Total of All CLINS will be that sum. The Government may use various price analysis techniques and procedures to make a price reasonableness determination. Offers that do not meet the technical capability requirements of the Statement of Work shall not be selected regardless of price.

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

(d)  All Offerors are advised that, in the interest of efficiency, the Government reserves the right to conduct the review in the most effective manner.  Specifically, the Government may first sort the quotes of all Offerors by price from lowest price to the highest.  Thereafter, the Government will review the Technical Capability of the lowest priced quote only.  If the lowest priced Offeror s Technical Capability is determined to be acceptable and meets the requirements, the Government may make award to that Offeror without further reviews of the remaining Offerors  Technical Capability.  If the lowest priced Offeror s Technical Capability is determined to not meet the requirement, then the Government may review the Technical Capability next lowest priced quote, and so on, until the Government reaches a quote that is determined to meet the Technical Capability requirements.

Description
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 12.6, and Part 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested, and a written solicitation document will not be issued.

This solicitation is a request for quotations (RFQ), and is set aside for qualified Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) sources. Qualifying sources will need to be verified in Veteran Information Page (VIP) by the closing date of the RFQ. Award will be based on the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source for meeting or exceeding the requirements as stated herein.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 811219, with a small business size standard of $20.5M.

Evaluation Criteria:
Technically acceptability evaluation criteria will be on a pass or fail basis and based on the following:

Contractor Capability Statement: Offeror s capability statement for meeting or exceeding the governments minimum requirement in accordance with the enclosed Statement of Work (SOW). Contractors who merely restate what is in the SOW will receive an unacceptable/fail evaluation rating.
  
Past Performance: Contractor past performance will be based on review of CPARs as shown under FAPIIS/PPIRS.  Any uncorrected marginal and unsatisfactory ratings will be referred to the SBA for a Certificate of Competency (COC). If COC is not granted they will receive an unacceptable/fail evaluation rating.

  Evaluation of Options:
Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government s best interests, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. This includes options under FAR 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, which applies to this solicitation.  Evaluation of options under FAR 52.217-8 will be accomplished by using the prices offered for the last option period to determine the price for a 6-month option period, which will be added to the base and other option years to arrive at the total price.
Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. There are several benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see Section VI of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Country Representative is a member of the DCHA/OTI Asia Regional Team, reports to the OTI Asia Regional Team Lead or designee, and is based in Malaysia.  The Country Representative's principal responsibility will be development, oversight, and management of DCHA/OTI's Malaysia country program.  The incumbent will be called upon to represent OTI's mission and programs to Embassy colleagues, Malaysian government officials, in-country visitors, senior officials from other international organizations, bilateral donors, and local government officials.</p>
<p>The OTI Malaysia program supports the U.S. Government's larger objective of assisting Malaysia in transforming the momentum generated by its recent, historic election into meaningful, lasting reforms and a strengthened democratic system. In May, Malaysians elected a multi-racial, multi-party opposition coalition led by former Prime Minister Mahatir Mohamad, in alliance with longtime opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim.  The vote was an extraordinary and unexpected rejection of the corrupt and increasingly autocratic regime of Najib Razak and marked the first time since Malaysia gained independence from Britain in 1957 that the Barisan Nasional coalition had lost. The new Malaysian government now faces the challenge of meeting the high expectations of its supporters while addressing the rampant corruption that characterized the previous government. In close coordination with Embassy colleagues and other USG actors, the OTI Malaysia program will support key government actors working to introduce key reforms, address corruption, and improve transparency as well as media entities seeking to increase public awareness, understanding, and engagement in the reform process. OTI's rapid and targeted programing addresses emerging issues and empowers local partners to leverage timely and locally driven activities that enhance engagement between government and citizens in addition to promoting norms of tolerance, coexistence, and dialogue.</p>
<p>CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Country Representative requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of an operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The incumbent has a high level of integrity and attention to detail to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation. The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. She or he places a premium on the building of positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The incumbent is able to prioritize and complete tasks without follow-up by the supervisor, while also filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The Country Representative is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based DCHA/OTI Asia Regional Team Leader or his/her designee, the Country Representative - Malaysia will perform the following duties:</p>
<p>At the GS-14 Country Representative level:<br />Note: Duties and responsibilities are listed in order of importance for this position</p>
<p>&#9679;	Manage a high-profile program in a dynamic environment and provide programmatic, operational, and strategic guidance to OTI's implementing partners (contractors and/or grantees) ensuring that activities are contributing to OTI's program objectives and are within the partner's scope;</p>
<p>&#9679;	Conceptualize and design program strategies and objectives in close coordination with OTI staff, U.S. Embassy, Host Country government, and local civil society officials based on political analysis and U.S. Government policy.</p>
<p>&#9679;	Communicate and coordinate OTI's in-country activities between OTI and its implementing partners, USAID, the U.S. Embassy and other donor organizations;</p>
<p>&#9679;	Design and review staffing plans to meet overall program objectives as well as recruit, train, supervise, and evaluate the performance of in-country OTI staff;</p>
<p>&#9679;	Monitor local and regional political developments and regularly brief OTI and partner <br />staff on their potential programmatic impact;</p>
<p>&#9679;	Analyze and report on current political developments, security concerns, and other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&#9679;	Provide recommendations to the Washington-based Contracting Officer Representative (COR) and/or the Regional Team Leader on implementing partner performance, the appropriateness of the partner's scope to OTI's country objectives, partner's budgets, and modifications thereto;</p>
<p>&#9679;	Provide USAID concurrence on all implementing partner activities, including final approval of grantees for grants under contract, in accordance with the USAID's Automated Directives System (ADS);</p>
<p>&#9679;	Ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, as well as monitoring and evaluation;</p>
<p>&#9679;	Ensure that OTI's programs and activities are monitored and evaluated and that lessons learned are applied to ongoing or future activities;</p>
<p>&#9679;	Prepare and maintain OTI program budgets for field operations;</p>
<p>&#9679;	Serve as OTI's primary liaison with USAID Mission personnel, U.S. Embassy staff, Host-Country Government Officials, UN Organizations, Indigenous and International Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), and other pertinent organizations.  Develop and maintain collaborative relationships to ensure close coordination at the field level, identify the widest range of potential local partners and opportunities, and achieve maximum synergy with other programs;</p>
<p>&#9679;	Prepare operational plans in collaboration with the U.S. Embassy, including logistics and property use guidelines, closeout and hand-over, security procedures, and contingency and evacuation plans;</p>
<p>&#9679;	Ensure that all OTI and partner field staff adhere to in-country security guidelines set by the U.S. Embassy Regional Security Officer and other organizations such as the United Nations or host government;</p>
<p>&#9679;	Articulate program strategy, as well as communicate and coordinate OTI's in-country activities between OTI and its implementing partners, USAID, and other donor organizations; prepare and disseminate programmatic, financial and periodic reports to the USAID Mission, OTI/Washington and other organizations as appropriate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:</p>
<p>The Country Representative will be supervised by the Washington-based DCHA/OTI Regional Team Leader for Asia or his/her designee as part of OTI's Field Programs Division. The Country Representative will also report to the US Embassy/Malaysia's Chief of Mission or designee. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision. Though this is a senior field-based position, the incumbent is expected to actively and proactively collaborate with OTI/Washington leadership, and to fully utilize, embrace, and become an expert on OTI systems and processes. Failure to adequately perform the scope of work above and/or failure to take direction from the supervisor may result in corrective actions, including denial of step or grade increases, extension of contract probationary periods, performance improvement plans, and/or termination for the convenience of USAID/OTI.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:</p>
<p>The supervisor will provide administrative directions in terms of broadly defined missions or functions. The employee will independently plan, design and carry out programs, projects, studies or other work assignments. The employee's work will be considered technically authoritative and normally accepted without significant change, and will be reviewed in terms of fulfillment of program objectives, influence on the overall program, or contribution to the advancement of the objective.</p>
<p>10.	AREA OF CONSIDERATION: U.S. Citizenship</p>
<p>11.	PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>PHYSICAL DEMANDS:<br />While in Malaysia, the work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands.

<p>AAPD 06-10 - PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 28, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.  Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES - Please see Attachment 2 to this solicitation for information on AAPD No. 18-02.</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).<br />&emsp;<br />ATTACHMENT 2</p>

<p>APPENDIX D - DIRECT USAID CONTRACTS WITH A U.S. CITIZEN OR A U.S. RESIDENT ALIEN FOR PERSONAL SERVICES ABROAD</p>
<p>GP 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES (MAY 2018) (Pursuant to class deviation #M/OAA-DEV-AIDAR-18-3c)</p>
<p>USAID will provide Medevac services to the contractor and authorized dependents, through the Department of State's Bureau for Medical Services (MED), similar to those provided to U.S. Government employees in accordance with 16 FAM 300 Medical Travel. Medevac costs include travel and per diem, but do not include medical care costs. To be covered by the Medevac program, the contractor and authorized dependents must obtain and maintain international health insurance coverage that includes overseas hospitalization, and must provide proof of such insurance to the contracting officer prior to relocation abroad.</p>

<DESC>High Energy Laser (HEL) Flexible Prototype <br />Request for Information (RFI)
<p>1.0 Description</p>
<p>1.1 The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) is interested in rapid demonstration and verification of a laser weapon system (LWS) in a realistic operating environment for potential future integration with an airborne vehicle. Responses to this RFI should provide evidence of demonstrated LWS potential for military utility. AFLCMC requests estimates of costs and time required to complete any remaining development, subsystem level testing, system level integration, and integrated system-level ground testing. This information will be used by AFLCMC as market research and as a basis to assess the feasibility, cost, schedule and risk associated with an airborne HEL Flexible Prototype program.</p>
<p>1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This RFI does not commit the U.S. Government to contract for any supply or service. Moreover, the AFLCMC is not seeking proposals at this time, and it will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the respondent party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if issued.</p>
<p>2.0 Background</p>
<p>2.1 For the purposes of rapid demonstration and verification, the Air Force would prefer a non-developmental LWS suitable for airborne applications. In May 2017, Eglin AFB released the "Airborne Tactical Laser Technology" RFI, and those responses have been reviewed. For the purposes of planning timelines for this HEL Flexible Prototype RFI response, assume a 12 month schedule constraint from the time of contract award for integration to system level ground test verification of a LWS. The success of meeting this schedule milestone is the primary factor for continued work toward the flying prototype and the possibility of future LWS production.</p>
<p>2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has decided not to release a classified RFI addendum to describe specific uses to all qualified vendors. The unclassified RFI addendum&nbsp;will be made available upon request. Interested parties must provide an appropriately cleared point of contact and a classified, preferably SIPRNET, email address to receive the addendum. Send requests to: Program Manager, Doug Rogers (<strong>douglas.m.rogers6.civ@mail.smil.mil</strong>) and Technology Protection Lead, Chaun Edwards (<strong>chaun.l.edwards.civ@mail.smil.mil</strong>).</p>
<p>2.3 Security Requirements: While this RFI is unclassified, responses may be either unclassified or classified up to the SECRET level.</p>
<p>3.0 Requested Information</p>
<p>3.1 Provide an RFI response that clearly documents all applicable previous and current development, testing, and operational use of LWS technology potentially suitable for operations in a flight environment.</p>
<p>3.2 Describe your definition of a LWS as it pertains to the information provided in the RFI addendum. Furthermore, provide estimates of DoD Defense Acquisition Guidebook based technology readiness levels (TRL) of essential LWS subsystems and attributes pertinent to the use cases in the RFI addendum. Include subsystems and attributes such as but not limited to: cooling, electrical power, laser, beam control, battle management, irradiance at range, power level achievable, power requirements, engagement range, duty cycle, fire-control (find/fix/track of designated target), energy storage, computing, command &amp; control, jitter mitigation, environmental requirements, atmospheric attenuation, weight, volume, and beam wavelength/bandwidth, and airborne platform integration/interface requirements.</p>
<p>3.3 The government is interested in understanding cost, schedule, performance, and risk of each LWS concept submitted. Cost estimates are assumed to be in 2018 dollars unless indicated otherwise.</p>
<p>3.4 Provide a DoD Defense Acquisition Guidebook based TRL estimate of an integrated ground test ready LWS.</p>
<p>4.0 Responses</p>
<p>4.1 Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI with a white paper not to exceed 20 pages using 12 point Times New Roman font. White papers are <strong>due no later than 15 June 2018, 1700 Eastern Time</strong>. Unclassified responses shall be submitted via secure e-mail or secure website only to the Program Manager, Doug Rogers (<strong>douglas.rogers.7@us.af.mil</strong>) and the Lead Engineer, Maj Adam Tobias (<strong>adam.tobias@us.af.mil</strong>). Classified responses shall be submitted via SIPRNET e-mail to Doug Rogers (<strong>douglas.m.rogers6.civ@mail.smil.mil</strong>) and Chaun Edwards (<strong>chaun.l.edwards.civ@mail.smil.mil</strong>). Interested parties shall follow the instructions below regarding how to deliver the white paper response package content. RFI responses shall be organized into two separate sections as outlined below.</p>
<p>4.1.1 Section 1 of the white paper response shall provide administrative information, and shall include the following as a minimum:</p>
<p>4.1.1.a Company name, mailing address, overnight delivery address (if different from mailing address), CAGE code, phone number, fax number, and e-mail of designated point of contact. Respondents are further requested to indicate their Foreign Ownership, Control or Influence (FOCI) status, if applicable.</p>
<p>4.1.1.b A statement stipulating the submitter's desired distribution of the white paper.</p>
<p>4.1.2 Section 2 of the white paper shall address the information requested in Section 3.0 of this RFI. Proprietary information, if any, MUST BE CLEARLY MARKED. Please be advised that all submissions become government property and will not be returned. Only government employees will review submitted responses to this RFI. Respondents are advised that employees of commercial firms under contract with the government may be used to administratively process submissions and perform other administrative duties requiring access to other contractor's proprietary information. These administrative support contracts include nondisclosure agreements prohibiting contractor employees from disclosing any information submitted by other contractors or using such information for any purpose other than that for which it was furnished.</p>
<p>5.0 Industry Discussion</p>
<p>Government representatives may or may not choose to hold an Industry Day or meet with respondents after white papers are submitted. Such discussions, if desired, will be scheduled by government invitation directly with individual respondents and based on compelling responses to this RFI. The intent of any such discussions would only be to obtain additional clarification of potential capabilities to meet government requirements and further expose risks (especially development risks).</p>

<p>Questions regarding this announcement shall be submitted in writing via e-mail to the Program Manager, Doug Rogers (<strong>douglas.rogers.7@us.af.mil</strong>). Verbal questions will NOT be accepted. Questions will be addressed by posting answers to the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps.gov) website. Accordingly, questions shall NOT contain proprietary or classified information. The government does not guarantee questions received after 15 June 2018, 1700 Eastern Time will be answered.</p>
<p>7.0 Summary</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY to understand industry's available LWS technology. The U.S. Government has made no final solicitation decision regarding eventual procurement or by what means such a solicitation, if any, would be handled (FAR or other transactions). The information provided in this RFI is subject to change and is not binding upon the U.S. Government. The U.S. Government has not made a commitment to procure any of the items discussed, and release of this RFI should not be construed as such a commitment or as authorization to incur costs for which reimbursement would be required or sought. All submissions become U.S. Government property and will not be returned.</p>

<DESC><p>Amendment 0003 ***UPDATE***10-17-18<br /><br />In August 2018, the Network CFT conducted an industry Technology Exchange Meeting in Raleigh, NC to conduct market research on distributed computing (mission command) solutions and the potential to deliver Cloud services to tactical formations. Following the Technology Exchange Meetings, the Army issued a Request for White Papers on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO).<br /><br />The Army received 78 white papers that are currently being reviewed. Assessments are anticipated to be completed by the end of October, and industry can expect to receive a response by late November. <br /><br />Vendors with promising capability will receive an invitation for a no cost demo, to be held in the December - January timeframe. At these demonstrations, vendors will show their capability focused on technical maturity, operational relevance and technical ability to integrate into the Army's network design. They will be expected to answer technical questions from a panel of government technical, program and operational subject matter experts.<br /><br />The government assessment leads will present outcomes of the demonstrations to Network-CFT and PEO C3T leadership. As part of these outcomes, the Army will develop an experimentation/assessment plan as well as identification of possible resourcing for promising capabilities. If selected, vendors will be notified of next progressive steps.</p>

<DESC><p>This notice is to announce a Request for Information in support of a Prototype Project under the Authority of Section 2371b of Title 10, U.S.C. to carry out Other Transactions. Specifically, the Government has a need for a Secure Intra-Soldier Wireless Module with Reduced Size and Power which will allow U.S. Army Research Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Communications and Electronics Research and Development Engineering Center (CERDEC), Night Vision Electronics Sensors Directorate (NVESD) to address emerging requirements for smaller, lower power Intra-Soldier Wireless (ISW) modules that can support AES-256 bit encryption. The objective of this effort is to demonstrate significant size and power reduction in prototype ISW modules to support integration with dismounted Soldier systems such as the Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS). This effort will also address emerging requirements for improved encryption to support certification for Secure but Unclassified (SBU) and Secret and Below (SAB) operation. The products of this effort will enable integration of secure, small, low power ISW modules with existing or developmental sensor systems to provide improved ISW capabilities to the dismounted Soldier. In summary, this effort will deliver prototype ISW modules that can be evaluated against established size, power consumption, and security requirements. NVESD anticipates a single twenty (20) month prototype agreement award to support this program.</p>

<p>Attached are the Q&amp;As from the Industry Day held September 20, 2018.</p>
<p style="mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto">Also attached is the updated NIIN population separated into Active and Inactive items.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The spreadsheet includes stock on hand, due-in, annual demand quantity, and supplier data, as well as other information.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><br /><br />For the Active items, there are three groups identified:</p>
<p>1.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Initial Priced Group - These are items DLA anticipates including in the RFP to be priced. These will be included in the evaluation of proposals.</p>
<p>2.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Future Price Group - Based upon the current stock position and anticipated demand, pricing for these items will not be required initially; however DLA anticipates requiring pricing at some point during the base performance period.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These items will not be priced at the time of proposal submission and will not be included in the evaluation of proposals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<DESC>Fleet Logistics Center Yokosuka (FLCY) &amp; Fleet Readiness Center Western Pacific (FRCWP), in support of NAVAIR's Program Manager Aviation (PMA) 207, is seeking interested contractors with significant KC-130J experience to provide scheduled and unscheduled Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) services for U.S. Marine Corps KC-130J aircraft forward deployed to the Western Pacific region. The place of performance will be in facilities proposed by the Contractor that meet the requirements of the contract.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The government's range requirements for the place of performance are not yet defined and we are open to industry feedback. The prior solicitation, N62649-14-R-0089, required the place of performance to be within 2,600 nautical miles of MCAS Iwakuni, Japan.</span>&nbsp; If approved, the government is considering potential for&nbsp;more than 4 option years.<br /><br />The incumbent contractor is AIROD SDN BHD (CAGE Y5029).&nbsp; The existing contract is currently performed in the contractor's facilities in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.<br />
<p><br />Contractor MRO support will include the following:</p>
<p>1) Depot Level Maintenance<br />Depot level maintenance (also known as Heavy Maintenance) tasks/actions are those requiring major overhaul or complete rebuilding, remanufacturing, or modification of aircraft structures, parts, assemblies, and end items, including support equipment in accordance with the Integrated Maintenance Plan (IMP) Specification and other applicable maintenance manuals.</p>
<p>2) Planned Maintenance Interval (PMI) work under IMP<br />IMP requirements provide for airframe, systems and component inspection (through visual and Non-Destructive Inspection (NDI) methods), defect correction, preventative maintenance, operational checkouts and Technical Directive compliance.</p>
<p>The IMP requirements for aircraft subject to this process are the minimum requirements, formulated and established to the depth required to ensure the reliability, operational availability, safe operation and airworthiness of the aircraft for the duration of the established service period. The IMP Program will provide depot support throughout the total service life of the aircraft.</p>
<p>a. PMI events for KC-130J will be based on the latest NAVAIR Specification.</p>
<p>b. The estimated Aircraft throughput is 4 aircraft per year. However, the contract type will be indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) and will not guarantee either the quantity or frequency of aircraft inductions.</p>
<p>c. It is anticipated that the Contractor shall be capable of supporting a nominal workload of 1 aircraft in flow, with a surge capacity to 3 aircraft in flow.</p>
<p>d. Aircraft inducted for PMI will be flown to the contractor's facility.</p>
<p>3) In-Service Repairs (ISR)<br />Unscheduled maintenance requirements are those requirements, (typically identified as Depot Level Maintenance), which cannot be directly related to any scheduled requirement described herein and which are discovered as an incidental result of the following functions accomplished as a part of and during the scheduled inspection, and during squadron operational use.</p>
<p>a. ISR repairs are expected to be completed either concurrently with PMI events or as standalone actions.</p>
<p>b. ISR repairs may require the Contractor to dispatch personnel as a contractor field service team (CFT) to perform aircraft ISR throughout the east Pacific region, and other areas as required, without impacting PMI event turn-around times (TAT).</p>
<p>4) Aircraft Modifications <br />a. Aircraft modifications (e.g. technical directives, airframe changes, etc.) shall be accomplished either concurrently with PMI events or as standalone actions.</p>
<p>b. The Government will provide the technical data and material required for completing modifications.</p>
<p>5) Customer Service<br />Customer Service requirements include Squadron Operational Level maintenance tasks performed concurrent with PMI activities when approved by the Government.</p>
<p>6) Engineering Support<br />Engineering services, necessary to support the requirements of the contract, including submittal of repair procedures to be reviewed and approved by the Government.</p>
<p>7) Logistics Support<br />Logistics services necessary to support the requirements of the contract, including timely supply data and material requisition requests necessary for completing aircraft maintenance requirements within the established TAT. The government will provide or directly fund procurement of all material.</p>
<p>8) Program Management Support<br />Program Management necessary to support the requirements of the contract, including annual Program Management Reviews (PMR), weekly production meetings, Production Plans that identify the critical path to PMI completion within the established TAT.</p>
<p>Interested companies are asked to respond to this notice by submitting the following information to the Contracting Officer via email: kurt.dronenburg@fe.navy.mil. Please also include any questions or comments related to the requirements described above:</p>
<p>(1) Company name, point of contact, telephone numbers, e-mail address, company CAGE Code, and DUNS</p>
<p>(2) Approximate annual gross revenue for the past 5 years (if available).</p>
<p>(3) Description of the company's ability to mobilize, manage and finance a contract of this size.</p>
<p>(4) Description of Government or commercial contracts for work on identical Type/Model/Series (T/M/S) aircraft (both as prime and sub-contractor)*</p>

<DESC><div>16 April 2018:&nbsp; This is an INDUSTRY DAY ANNOUNCEMENT by Fleet Readiness Center Western Pacific (FRCWP) and NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center Yokosuka (FLCY)&nbsp;for Aviation Depot-Level Maintenance, Modification, Repair and Overhaul (MMRO) services in support of United States Marine Corps KC-130J aircraft. This notice is issued solely for informational and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. The planned industry day will serve as a market research tool, both for informing industry of United States Government (USG) requirements for these services and for determining industry's interest, awareness and capabilities for providing those services. The industry day forum will allow for networking among interested service providers and lead to USG awareness of industry's capabilities for supporting this aircraft. <strong>FRCWP will host the Industry</strong> <strong>Day at Naval Air Facility (NAF) Atsugi&nbsp;from</strong> <strong>23 to 24 May 2018, beginning at 9:00 AM and ending at 4:00 PM each day</strong>.</div>
<div></div>
<div>FRCWP uses contracts with MMRO service providers to support aircraft maintenance. In general, requirements will consist of Integrated Maintenance Plan (IMP) and In-Service Repair (ISR) Depot-Level support. FRCWP is particularly interested in identifying potential service providers for its upcoming&nbsp;KC-130J IMP and ISR support requirement. Aviation MMRO service providers will have the opportunity to learn about FRCWP's mission, to meet with contracting personnel from Fleet Logistics Center Yokosuka (FLCY) and Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), and to provide feedback to the Government to consider as we develop our requirements. If questions arise during the industry day that cannot be answered in person, those answers will be published on FEDBIZOPPS after the event. There will be opportunities for Industry/Government one-on-one sessions on 24 May for interested service providers. Depending on the number of companies attending, the one-on-one sessions are anticipated to be held in 60-minute intervals on the hour by appointment only.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Advance registration for this event is required</strong>. Parties interested in attending the industry day and the one-on-one sessions must submit&nbsp;the attached documents in your registration package via email to Mr. Kurt Dronenburg at kurt.dronenburg@fe.navy.mil and to Mr. Seiji Yoshino at seiji.yoshino.ja@fe.navy.mil. Please also&nbsp;include the&nbsp;company's name, the names and titles of participating individuals, and contact information to include telephone numbers and email addresses in your registration package. Participating companies are further requested to provide CAGE and DUNS codes if available. No more than five participants per company may register. Additional instructions for accessing the industry day location will be provided at the time registration packages are received. <strong>All registrations must be received no later than 17:00 PM Tokyo time on 30 April 2018.</strong></div>
<div><strong></strong></div>
<div><strong>Registration submittals must include NAF Atusgi Base Access requests per the attached files.</strong> Participants wishing to attend the conference who do not possess the proper documents for access to NAF Atsugi must advise the USG during the reservation process.   If an attendee is other than a Japanese National or SOFA Sponsored, that individual must present a valid passport with current visa or alien registration card to the security personnel at the Main Gate in order to come aboard NAF Atsugi.     <strong>All attendees not driving onto NAF Atsugi must be present at the NAF Atsugi Main (Front) Gate no later than 0800 (8:00 A.M.) on May 23rd and 24th to be escorted aboard the installation.</strong></div>
<div><strong></strong></div>
<div>Note:  Per NAFATSUGIINST 5512.9F and USFJINST 31-204, "Designated Third Country Nationals" have additional registration requirements that must be completed before base access is approved. Attendees from such designated countries are advised to not make any travel arrangements/reservations before base access approval is confirmed. FLCY/FRCWP will not process access requests for Government Officials from such designated countries.&nbsp;"Third Countries" include Malaysia and Singapore.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Vendors are responsible for securing their own lodging and food during this event. Industry participation is voluntary and the USG will not reimburse respondents or attendees for efforts expended as a result of this notice.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>The government will provide draft solicitation documents describing our planned requirements in a future update to FBO.</strong></div>

<DESC><strong>Notice of Amendment to Duration of Proposed Bridge in Services.&nbsp; </strong>The proposed sole source contracting action has been extended one additional month for a period of performance of 11/01/2018 - 01/31/2019. The added month is necessary to allow adequate time for a transition of management and services at the Port Facilities. The extended duration has been determined to remain insufficient to offset startup costs necessary to receive a competitive proposal because the incumbent is uniquely positioned to not incur such costs. Any interested sources that believe they have the capabilities and resources to fulfill the need for a bridge in services at the Port Facilities from 11/01/2018 through 01/31/2019 must contact Dylan White directly at dylan.white@gsa.gov. Submit requested information described in the first paragraph of this notice.
<div><br /></div>
<div>Responses must be received by 10/22/2018 no later than 11:59 p.m. Mountain Time. The Government reserves the right to consider any information submitted in response to this notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</div>

Therefore, Solicitation 47PJ0018R0248 is cancelled in it's entirety. A new Soliciation will be issued in the upcoming months and will be posted on www.fbo.gov.</strong></p>
DESCRIPTION OF PROPOSED WORK: The USDC is initiating a project to remodel space within their break room, conference room, storage room, and copy room. In addition, they are initiating a project to replace carpet in a large portion of their office space.
<p>**Estimated Price Range: $25,000 - $100,000</p>

<p>**Small Business Size Standard: $36.5 million</p>

<p>LOCATION OF THE WORK: Fargo, Cass County, North Dakota</p>
<p>Contract Performance: 90 calendar days after notice to proceed</p>
<p>PROCEDURES FOR AWARD: The Government will first evaluate price to determine the lowest through highest priced offers. The Government intends to evaluate the technical proposals of only the three lowest priced offers, subject to the number of proposals received. The remaining technical proposals, if any, shall not be evaluated as to technical acceptability unless one of the three lowest price offers proves to be technically unacceptable. If one of the three lowest priced proposals proves to be technically unacceptable, then the fourth-lowest priced proposal (and so on) will be evaluated for technical acceptability. Any costs incurred by offerors in preparing or submitting offers are the offerors' sole responsibility; the United States will not reimburse any offeror for any proposal preparation costs.</p>
<p>PLAN AVAILABILITY: The solicitation will be available for electronic download at no charge from the Federal Business Opportunities website at www.fbo.gov.</p>
<p>AMENDMENTS TO SOLICITATION: It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the EPS site at www.fbo.gov for the release of any amendments.</p>

<p>BONDING: Bonding is required.</p>
<p>SECURITY: Before employees are allowed to work on this project site, all personnel are required to pass a security check. Forms will be provided to the successful offeror after award.</p>
<p>IMMIGRATION CONSIDERATIONS: In addition to the previously mentioned security check, any foreign national employed to work on this site will be required to provide a document authorizing him/her to work in the United States such as a copy of his/her resident alien card or a copy of his/her employment authorization card from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security/U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Bureau. Also, any person born outside of the United States who is now a naturalized U.S. citizen must provide proof of U.S. citizenship such as a copy of his/her U.S. passport or a copy of his/her certificate of naturalization.</p>
<p>BUY AMERICAN ACT / TRADE AGREEMENTS: This procurement is subject to the requirements of the Buy American Act. Per Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 25.401(a)(1), trade agreements (such as NAFTA) do not apply to acquisitions set aside for small businesses. Accordingly, any offeror proposing the use of foreign construction material, other than those articles listed in FAR 25.104, must request an exception to the Buy American Act as described in FAR Part 25.2. Such an exception must then be approved by the Government before the requested material may be used in this construction project.</p>
<p>ELIGIBLE OFFERORS: All responsible small business firms may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>All prospective offerors are also required to use the System for Award Management (SAM) in federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission.

<DESC>Solicitation Number:	W912DQ19R4001<br />Request for Industry Input<br /> <br />The following is a Request for Industry Input for a Roof Replacement Contract. It is anticipated that a solicitation in reference to this request will be published in the Federal Business Opportunities website in the winter of 2018.
<p>The Government is seeking the input of industry for a requirement under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 238160 (Roofing Contractors) to obtain information on the feasibility of executing a roofing project with a required, specific and limited time constraint. This announcement is for industry input only.  NO PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND NONE WILL BE ACCEPTED AT THIS TIME.  Note:  Feedback does not restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition or project approach.  Also, the Government will not reimburse respondents for any cost incurred in preparation of a response to this notice.</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Kansas City District seeks the input of industry regarding the feasibility of successful completion of a construction contract to replace a low-slope roof system on an industrial building with a required, specific, and limited time constraint.  The work will be located at an Army facility near Kansas City, Missouri.  Due to the extremely short timeframe in which a portion of the work must be executed, the complexity of logistical coordination that will be required in order to execute a portion of this work, and the number of roofing personnel required to be working in relatively close proximity during this short time period, the Government is contemplating an unrestricted Contract solicitation.   The estimated magnitude of this roofing contract is $4M-$5M.</p>
<p>Work under this contract includes removal and replacement of a low slope roof on a single industrial building.  There are two roof areas in particular in which schedule constraints may impact the ability to execute all work required in these two areas.  Existing Roof information for these areas is summarized below:</p>
<p>Roof Area 1<br />Sub Area 	Roof SF	Membrane	Deck<br />JN	 5,916	EPDM	Concrete<br />JS	 7,157	EPDM	Metal<br />H	 1,440	EPDM	Metal<br />I	    440	EPDM	Wood<br />Roof Area 2<br />Sub Area 	Roof SF	Membrane	Deck<br />P	15,412	EPDM	Concrete<br />Q	  1,376	EPDM	Concrete<br />AC	     194	BUR	Concrete</p>
<p><br />Work will include removal of existing roofing materials down to the deck and replacement of the roof with a TPO roof system.  Roof deck in sub area H exhibits deterioration and is to be replaced with a metal deck.   Roof drains will be cleaned out, and appropriate flashing, seaming, and leak-stop accommodations shall be provided for all joints, existing mechanical equipment supports and penetrations, and vertical edge conditions, in accordance with final plans and specifications to be issued at a future date.</p>
<p>All personnel working on site or delivering materials/equipment to the project site must undergo security screening and be eligible for issuance of a temporary badge for access to the site.</p>
<p>Areas 1 and 2, including all sub areas, must have all roof replacement activities completed within a 7-day period during July 2019.</p>
<p>Due to the limited duration in which work must be completed and the scope of the roofing effort to be conducted in Areas 1 and 2, the Kansas City District is soliciting feedback from industry to assist in determining the feasibility for executing this work within the 7-day window.</p>
<p>An Industry Feedback Meeting/Webinar for interested contractors is scheduled for Friday, October 26, 2018 from 9am to 11am CDT at the Richard Bolling Federal Building, in the first floor USACE Emergency Operations Center, at 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, MO.  Due to meeting room space limitations, a maximum of two people per company will be granted access to the room to attend in person.</p>
<p>An overview of work required will be provided for Areas 1 and 2 and discussion and request for feedback will be focused on the feasibility of executing work in the short duration allotted.</p>
<p>To view or download draft versions of the plans and specifications for Areas 1 and 2, contractors must be registered with ProjNet at www.ProjNet.Org.  Downloads are available only through the ProjNet.org website.  The website is occasionally inaccessible due to maintenance. The government is not responsible for any loss of internet connectivity or for a contractor's inability to access the draft documents at the referenced website.<br />Prior to downloading, interested contractors MUST also have an active registration in the System for Award Management (SAM). Firms can register via the SAM internet web-site at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/.</p>
<p>**SAM NOTARIZED LETTER PROCEDURES:   An original, signed, and notarized letter identifying the authorized Entity Administrator for the entity associated with the Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number is now required within 30 days of activation for both NEW SAM.gov entity registrations and EXISTING entity updates or renewals.  Failure to do so within 30 days of activation may result in the registration no longer being active.  The notarized letters MUST BE POSTAL SERVICE MAILED (not emailed or faxed) to the "FEDERAL SERVICE DESK" and must contain the information outlined in the "instructions for domestic entities" or "instructions for international entities" located at https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service/office-of-systems-management/integrated-award-environment-iae/sam-update.  Templates for appointing an Entity Administrator are included within the respective instructions.**</p>
<p>ATTENTION: If you intend to download draft plans and specifications,  it is advised to assure your SAM registration is current, or if you do not have a SAM account, to register as soon as possible because download of documents will not be allowed without a current SAM registration.</p>
<p>To obtain draft versions of plans and specifications for Area 1 and Area 2, please email Jaclyn Yocum, Contracting Specialist, at Jaclyn.C.Yocum@usace.army.mil with the following information:</p>
<p>1)	Name<br />2)	Title<br />3)	Company Name<br />4)	Phone Number<br />5)	SAM Registration Number<br />6)	Indicate if you plan to attend the industry event in person, via Webinar, or by written response.  <br />7)	If attending in person, provide the name of each person who will attend (Maximum 2 per company).</p>
<p>Upon confirmation, you will be provided with a ProjNet Plan Room digital key and information on how to access the ProjNet Plan Room.   Draft Plans will be available from October 18 through October 25, 2018 in the Plan Room on ProjNet at https://www.projnet.org .</p>
<p>While feedback/industry input will be sought during the event, interested contractors may also respond in writing to this Request for Industry Input announcement with a limit of 5 pages for your response. The following information is requested:</p>
<p>1.	Organization name, address, email address, website address, telephone number, and business size (small or large) and type of ownership for the organization; include DUNS number and CAGE code.  Indicate if you are a Large Business, Small Business, and if applicable, sub-category of Small Business (Service Disabled Veteran Owned, HubZone, Women Owned).</p>
<p>2.	Firm's interest in providing a proposal on the pending solicitation, once issued.</p>
<p>3.	Firm's feedback on the feasibility of successfully completing roof replacement in Areas 1 and 2 within 7 calendar days.  Please provide the following assuming there are no weather-related issues (rain, excessive wind).</p>
<p>a.	Include specific information regarding why this work in Areas 1 and 2 is or is not feasible to be accomplished within 7 calendar days. <br />b.	Identify items that could impact feasibility of completing the work within the 7 calendar day window and the extent of impact that could potentially be overcome within the 7 calendar days.    <br />c.	Additional information to help assess feasibility is as follows:<br />i.	Multiple shifts per day are allowed.  <br />ii.	Pre-staging of materials will be allowed on roof areas near Areas 1 and 2, subject to structural load limitations.<br />iii.	Security screening and badging will be conducted prior to start of the work.<br />iv.	Contractor will be responsible for ensuring there are sufficient personnel and materials on hand to execute the work.<br />d.	Identify what additional information would be required to assist in determining feasibility or would assist you in providing a thorough price proposal.</p>
<p>4.	In the event of inclement weather during construction activities, the draft specifications require that any exposed roof area that has not been completed be covered with a second layer of SBS bitumen base sheet to ensure the roof is dried in.  This is expected to add the flexibility to delay completion of the total roof assembly should weather become an issue and these two areas cannot be completed in the 7-day time frame.   The Government requests industry input regarding the feasibility of this requirement as well as any suggested alternatives to ensuring protection of the incomplete roof areas for an extended period of time (6 to 12 months) if the roof repair cannot be completed with the 7-day duration due to weather conditions.</p>
<p>5.	Identify if, based upon the scope of this project, you would form a joint venture or partnering agreement to execute this work.  Provide information on your Joint Venture/Partners, if applicable.  If you have an established Joint Venture, please provide the DUNS number and CAGE code.</p>
<p>6.	Provide your firm's Bonding Capability (construction bonding level per contract and aggregate bonding level, both expressed in dollars).</p>
<p><br />Please send your responses via email to Jaclyn.C.Yocum@usace.army.mil.  Submissions should be received by 12:00 p.m. CDT, October 29, 2018.</p>

<DESC>SPACE AND NAVAL WARFARE SYSTEMS COMMAND (SPAWAR), in support of the Fleet Readiness Directorate (FRD), intends to execute a ceiling increase on a sole source basis to the Navigation Sensor System Interface (NAVSSI) Multiple Award Contract (MAC) which supports multiple U.S. Navy surface ships. The two (2) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) MAC holders are required to provide and install new NAVSSI systems and upgrade kits.  NAVSSI is currently installed on more than 115 ships, including the CG, CVN, DDG, LCC, LHA, LHD, LPD and LSD Classes.
The purpose of this posting is to provide notice of other than full and open competition and a sole source ceiling increase of contracts N00039-14-D-0002 (Micro USA, Inc.) and N00039-14-D-0003 (Systems Engineering Support Co.). This contract action increases the cumulative total of orders to be issued to the MAC holders by a not-to-exceed amount of $4,500,000. The period of performance for the current MAC contracts will not be extended as a result of this action as this additional ceiling is only intended to meet the immediate and urgent requirements of the fleet necessitating delivery and installation of certified NAVSSI systems and upgrade kits during the next twelve (12) months. SPAWAR is currently in the acquisition planning phase for the award of the follow-on NAVSSI MAC to meet all future fleet requirements beyond this period. Currently, these two (2) MAC holders are considered to be the only sources that can perform the urgently needed Government requirements until such time that the follow-on contracts can be competed and awarded.
This contract action is for systems and services which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only the above mentioned sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR part 6.302-1(a)(2). This action is justified under the attached J&A which is hereby posted in accordance with FAR 6.305.
