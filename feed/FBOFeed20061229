Specialization in areas of Tax Models, Revenue Estimation and Statistics of Income are in high demand.  Resident positions require candidates to have significant project management experience, to include the ability to prepare project work plans, statements of work and manage human resources.

The MMS and MMS-P use a suite of sensors and MET data from communications satellites along with an advanced weather model to provide accurate MET data out to a range of 500km.  They measure and trans mit MET conditions such as wind speed, wind direction, temperature, pressure and humidity, rate of precipitation, visibility, cloud height and cloud ceiling.  All of these are required for precise targeting and terminal guidance.  They enable artillery to have a greater probability of first round hit with indirect fire. For the first time, the artillery community has the capability of applying MET data along with the trajectory from the firing platform to the target area.  The current sources for these syst ems components are Vaisala Inc. and Smiths Detection. Suppliers capable of furnishing any components or spares must so indicate, by writing to Commander, USA C-E LCMC, ATTN: AMSEL-LC-IEW-R-SN, Building 1201E, Ft. Monmouth, NJ 07703-5000.

<DESC>THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSE (NIDA) plans to procure services from qualified organizations certified by the Small Business Administration under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act having the capability to provide logistical and operational support for the Clinical Trials Network (CTN). 

The development of the CTN was based, in part, upon a recommendation from the National Advisory Council on Drug Abuse and conclusions of the Physicians Leadership on National Drug Policy.  The Institute of Medicine/National Academy of Sciences report "Bridging the Gap Between Practice and Research:  Forging Partnerships with Community-Based Drug and Alcohol Treatment" also recommended a national network for drug abuse treatment trials.  These sites represent a variety of treatment traditions that include pharmacological as well as behavioral and other psychosocial interventions.  Furthermore, NIDA ensures a wide variety of patient populations in the selection of CTN recipients.  Women, minority groups, and adolescents are well represented.  This contract will support all activities to enable the CTN to conduct quality multi-site clinical trials on behavior, pharmacological, and integrated therapies in Community-based Treatment Programs (CTP).  The range of support services encompasses the following areas: 

1.	Coordinating logistic and operational support for a variety of CTN meetings; 
2.	Arranging the logistics and supporting the costs associated with coordinating network calls on an as needed basis; 
3.	Coordinating and paying for consultants who provide NIDA and the CTN grantees with expert advice on a variety of topics regarding the scientific and managerial aspects of the CTN; 
4.	Preparing publicity, meeting, and protocol related materials; 
5.	Providing a scientific writer/editor to prepare reports, take minutes of meetings and conference calls, and edit documents; 
6.	Reproducing and distributing research materials, protocol related documents, and educational materials;
7.	Creating and maintaining administrative data bases to support the CTN activities;
8.	Providing translational services for CTN materials and web sites already produced in English; 
9.	Updating and expanding the CTN web site; and,
10.	Providing other miscellaneous support services.

NIDA anticipates award of one cost-plus-fixed-fee, completion type contract for a period of five years with option quantities for additional effort.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code identified for this requirement is 541611 with a size standard of $6.5 million.  RFP No. NO1DA-7-2211 will be available electronically on or about January 16, 2007.  You can access the RFP through the FedBizOpps (URL: http://www.fedbizopps.gov) or through the NIDA website at the following address: (URL: http://www.nida.nih.gov/RFP/RFPList.html).  The electronic RFP will contain all information needed to submit a proposal.  No printed version of the solicitation document or source list is available.  NIDA will consider only proposals submitted by any responsible 8(a) certified offeror.  Response to the RFP will be due on or about March 2, 2007. This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract. THIS REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL IS 100% SET ASIDE FOR CURRENT SBA CERTIFIED 8(a) SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS. Offers from concerns other than eligible 8(a) concerns will not be considered. See Note 26.

The design of BGI's saturation sampler meets two important performance criteria which are not available from other manufacturers. (1) The size-selective performance of the BGI unit has been fully characterized in the laboratory and is the only model available whose inlet performance has been documented  in peer-reviewed literature (L. Kenny, et.al. "Aspiration and Sampling Efficiencies of the TSP and Louvered Particulate Matter Inlets", J. Environ. Monitoring, 2005, 487.) (2) BGI's saturation sampler includes use of shape-cut cyclone for accurate fractionation of PM2.5 aerosols and does not rely  on impactors whose loading performance is known to significantly degrade within a few hours of fields use (L. Kenny, et al. "Investigation on the Effects of Loading on PM2.5 Separators", Health and Safety Laboratory, Sheffield, England, 1998).  BGI is the sole manufacturer of the only saturation  monitor capable of meeting the field performance specification which are required for  EPA's  field campaigns. Therefore EPA  has identified BGI Incorporated the only vendor capable of satisfy the requirement. The circumstance permitting "other than full and open competition" is FAR 13.106(B)only  one source reasonably available. The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available. Consequently, any response failing to provided the aforementioned data and instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy  of the RFQ will be ignored.

<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement BAA 07-01.     The Naval Research Laboratory is interested in receiving innovative proposals that offer potential for advancement and improvement in the technical topic areas listed. This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.302(d) that provides for the competitive selection of research proposals. This BAA is a continuously open announcement valid through 31 December 2008. The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received. Awards under this BAA are expected to take the form of contracts. Grants, cooperative agreements, other transactions may also be awarded if appropriate. NRL encourages Educational Institutions, Small Businesses (SBs), Small Disadvantaged Business Concerns (SDBs) and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) to submit proposals under this BAA. In order to conserve valuable offeror and Government resources, prospective offerors shall first submit an initial proposal, including a rough cost estimate, to the technical point of contact for each topic. Prospective offerors are encouraged to submit initial proposals as early in the fiscal year as possible to maximize the potential for award. The selection of proposals for award will be based on a scientific review of proposals submitted in response to each BAA. The major purpose of the evaluation will be to determine the relative merit of the technical approach of each proposal. Business and contractual aspects, including proposed cost and cost realism, will also be considered as part of the evaluation. Selection of proposals for award will be based on the potential benefits to the Government weighed against the cost of the proposals, in view of the availability of funds. The complete BAA including proposal preparation instructions, technical points of contact for each topic, and evaluation criteria is available at http://heron.nrl.navy.mil/contracts/0708baa/baa.htm

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (formerly the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Management Analysis, Inc. (MAI), 2070 Chain Bridge Road, Suite 550, Vienna, VA 22182. The purpose of this contract is to provide support services for the Agencys competitive sourcing (A-76) activities.  MAI will assist the Agency through various implementation phases which will complete the FY 2006 and 2008 Competitive Sourcing Program activities to meet the Presidents Management Agenda (PMA) and assist the Agency with obtaining a green rating on the PMA scorecard.  These activities include continuing to provide post-competition review support semi-annually (quality assurance evaluation activities for previous competitive sourcing studies), conducting preliminary planning reviews for upcoming planned A-76 competitions, assisting with completion of OMB cost reports, compiling and completing the annual Fair Act Inventory, reviewing and updating the Agencys A-76 website and assisting the Agency in completing its scheduled A-76 competitions.  The estimated period of performance is for approximately two years with three one year options.  MAI has been the primary supporting consultant for AHRQs competitive sourcing program, including program management and execution of competitive studies in Fiscal Years 2003, 2004 and 2006.  In this role, MAI has gained an extraordinary understanding of the AHRQ competitive sourcing strategic goals and the organizational and operational structure of AHRQ.  Having been the supporting consultant for the planning and competition phases for all of the AHRQ FY03, FY 04 and FY06 studies, MAI posses extraordinary background information and familiarity with the functions studied, substantially facilitating MAIs ability to support AHRQ both in the conduct of the next round of studies and in continuing their work on the next (post-award) phases of the competitive sourcing life cycle for the previous FY03, FY04 and FY06 studies.  MAI, during the last four years, assisted AHRQ with other HHS elements to remain at the cutting edge of OMB Circular A-76 and other competitive sourcing efforts in many functional areas that have not been considered for possible outsourcing feasibility in the past, in any other Federal environment.  Interested parties should email a capability statement that is tailored specifically to the requirement mentioned above to the Contracting Officer at Jessica.Alderton@ahrq.hhs.gov no later than 1:00pm on JANUARY 4, 2007 (REVISED).  All responses will be considered by AHRQ.  Telephone requests will not be honored.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   12/29/06 Amendment 2 to RFQ-OH-07-00033. The purpose of this amendment is to indefinitely extend the due date for receipt of quotations pending an amendment to the solicitation. Needs Assessment for EPA Criteria Pollutant Scientific Literature Database The Clean Air Act  requires the establishment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for the "criteria" air pollutants (ozone, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide and lead) and the periodic review of these  standards. One of the primary responsibilities of the National  Center for Environmental Assessment (NCEA) of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) is to prepare Science Assessments (SA) and Science Assessment Supporting Documents (SASDs) previously known as Air Quality Criteria Documents (AQCDs) for these  criteria air pollutants.  The review of scientific literature is a fundamental component for these activities.  The EPA is considering the development of a continuous process that will identify, compile, characterize and prioritize new scientific studies, which shall include the creation of an  electronic database of information from the studies. Under this order, the EPA seeks to assess the needs of potential users of the literature database and to develop options for database designs that meet these needs. An important factor in the creation of the database is that the database shall  not be simply a method of linking a reference to a published abstract or paper. Input to the database shall be accomplished by individuals knowledgeable in the various scientific disciplines contained in the SA/SASDs  and database references must be categorized into experiments relative to dose,  exposure time, exposure model, endpoint and other parameters. Database queries shall be retrievable in tabular format. Epidemiology analysis and other data references shall be categorized into usable information. This acquisition is designated as a small business set-aside under NAICS code 541710,   size standard of 500 employees and procurement will be accomplished under FAR Part 12, Commercial Acquisition Procedures and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  Interested and responsible sources may submit a quotation in response to the RFQ -OH-07-00033, which shall be considered by  the Agency.   The Government will award an order resulting from the RFQ to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the RFQ, meets  the minimum requirements of the Statement of Work (SOW), delivery and task completion schedule.   The order resulting from this acquisition will be firm-fixed  price.  This office does not intend to mail hard copies of the RFQ, but will provide electronic copies upon request. Requests must include company name, mailing address, fax number and email address. All responsible sources may submit a written request to receive the RFQ to Yvonne Harris at   harris.yvonne@epa.gov or by fax at (513) 487-2107. All requests for the RFQ must be received at the office identified above no later than Thursday December 14, 2006. Telephone responses will not be honored.

Specifically, the USPS has a need to print forwarding address information for use by letter carriers at it?s mail delivery units . The objective of this notice is to gather product information from current sources of technology that can meet the requirements specified herein. This is a request for information only and is not a solicitation to purchase equipment or services. Information gathered through this announcement will be used to prequalify sources for a competitive product evaluation at the USPS and the opportunity to submit a proposal for this solution. Prequalified sources will be notified within three weeks of this announcement. Details will follow with a solicitation requesting a proposal from suppliers. Requests for information and the performance data submission should be provided to Mr. Mark S. Travers, Contracting Officer, Automation CMC, 8403 Lee Highway, Merrifield, VA, 22082-8150, Telephone (703) 280-7953. 

BACKGROUND: The USPS is deploying the Postal Automated Redirection System (PARS) on a nationwide basis.  As part of this effort, there is a requirement to print address move information for use by individual letter carriers at the various mail delivery units located throughout the United States and select territories.  The PARS deployment will require the purchase and deployment of approximately 30,000 printers at the mail delivery units.   

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS: The printers must be capable of meeting the following performance requirements:  

Print Method:		Thermal Transfer
Resolution:		203 DPI 
Print Length:		39?

The printers will interface with existing computers and workstations on the USPS network running Windows XP operating systems.  The connection will be USB interface to the computer. Paper and other consumables will be provided by the Postal Service.  

SCHEDULE AND DELIVERABLES: For purposes of this technology assessment and market survey, potential vendors shall provide performance data for available systems for USPS review. This information should include a complete description of a working unit which substantiates the vendor?s ability to meet the requirements in this specification. This written information shall be provided no later than October 23, 2006. Minor variations to the values expressed within the above specification will be considered by the USPS if such systems are currently in use in other postal administrations or market applications. Following USPS review of the submitted system performance data, pre-qualification determination will be made and competitive evaluation testing plans will be furnished. The prequalified suppliers are firms whose record of performance in the market place has demonstrated their ability to perform to consistently high standards. The USPS will not provide funding for development activities associated with meeting the specified requirements. Interested parties of this sources sought are to submit a total of two copies (one hard copy and one soft copy) of any company promotional handouts, brochures, catalogs, technology performance specifications, and operations manuals of equipment that meets or exceeds these specifications and requirements to the address provided in this announcement. Overly elaborate responses are neither expected nor required. The USPS by issuance of this notice makes no commitment to acquisition of any thermal printing technology.

<DESC>Request for Information - The United Stated Department of Agricultures (USDA) Farm Service Agency (FSA) seeks information related to its investigation of ways to consolidate and centralize its distributed AS/400 systems currently hosted in 2384 Service Centers.  This is a Request for Information (RFI) issued solely for information and planning purposes.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). FSA intends to assess the capabilities and, if appropriate, issue an RFP at a later date.  Please ensure that any sensitive or protected information is marked as such.  The Government will not pay for, nor reimburse, any expenses incurred in responding to this RFI.  Background - Current Environment:  FSAs current distributed environment includes 2384 State and County Service Centers, each equipped with an AS/400 Model 170 system.  Local users access their offices AS/400 via PC workstations running 5250 terminal emulation.  Output is printed on a combination of twinax-attached and network-attached printers.  An average office has about four users, making a total user community of about 10,000.  The primary use of these systems is to run S/36 applications developed and maintained by FSA from 1984 to the present.  These applications run in the S/36 Virtual Machine environment (not to be confused with the S36 Environment, or S36E).  The S/36 Virtual Machine environment provides binary compatibility for S/36 applications and data. IBM dropped support for the S/36 Virtual Machine after release V4R4 of the OS/400 operating system.  Our reliance on the S/36 Virtual Machine forces us to remain on an unsupported version of the OS/400 operating system.  The S/36 application portfolio consists of COBOL, RPG, and Assembler programs and subroutines; Screen and Menu members; OCL.  These make use of unique S/36 capabilities and extensions such as the Local Data Area, and OCL substitution expressions.  System facilities such as IDDU and Query/36 are also used.  The data is stored in Indexed (including Alternative Indices), Sequential, and Direct files.  Some files have multiple record types; and some numeric-defined fields may contain non-numeric data.   Each AS/400-S/36 environment hosts one to six counties.  The S/36 namespace does not include a hierarchical file system.  A naming convention is used to allow each of hosted counties to use the same file names.  The first counties filenames begin with A., the second with B. and so on.  This convention works fine for supporting a small number of counties on a single machine, but cannot be extended to support large-scale consolidation.  The applications were developed under the assumption that they would be running in a small, local namespace.  In 2000, FSA started deploying AS/400 systems and re-hosted the applications and data from S/36 systems.  Once on the AS/400 platform, FSA started using DB2, TCPIP, Java, Websphere, and MQ Series, as well as the S/36 emulation.  MQ Software products Data Flow Studio (DFS) and QPasa are also used for file transmissions and MQ Series administration.  The complete current environment consists of AS/400s running S/36 emulation, plus some AS/400-side code (CL, COBOL), DB2 databases, TCPIP communications, Java, Websphere, and MQ Series, DFS, and QPasa.  In addition to the legacy applications, FSA has developed centralized web-based applications.  Once a full suite of Web-based applications is available, these will replace the legacy applications and the distributed environment.  Some of the existing web-based applications must get data from, or replicate data to the legacy applications.  This is done through a combination of AS/400 CL programs, Java programs, Websphere applications, MQ Series, DFS, QPasa, and additions to legacy applications.  Planned Environment:  The data stored on the 2,384 AS/400 systems includes sensitive personal and financial data.  Recent audits have identified a lack of physical security at the Service Centers, which house these systems, as a risk.  The Service Centers are generally leased office spaces located across the country.  Improving the physical security in all of these offices is an expensive process and is not likely to be accomplished quickly.  The building changes would have to be negotiated into the individual leases, and may not be possible until the current leases expire.  Due to the cost and timeframe of improving physical security, FSA is exploring the alternative of re-hosting the legacy applications in a small number of secure, central sites.  FSA is researching several variations of the centralized hosting approach, but they all share many characteristics.  The number of central sites being considered is in the range of 1 to 6.  For all centralized approaches, Service Center users will remotely access the centralized servers from their local workstations, via terminal emulation software or a web client.  Print output will be directed back to network printers in the appropriate Service Center.  The centralized systems will interact with other hosts, including mainframe and web farm.  The centralized approaches under consideration are:  1.  FSA would remove the existing AS/400 systems from the Service Centers and relocate all of the existing hardware to a small number (1-6) of centralized hosting facilities.  For six centers, this is about 400 AS/400 systems per center.  2.  FSA would re-host the legacy applications and data on a larger computing platform, which provides binary-level emulation of the current environment AS/400, S/36, MQ Series, Websphere, etc.  Assuming that one larger system can host the workload from many legacy AS/400s, and that users and data can be correctly routed and segregated, re-hosting on larger systems would mean fewer systems for the hosting facilities to operate.  This consolidation may include providing a virtual partition for each existing system.  3.  FSA would re-compile application software in order to migrate to another hardware platform, which could be scaled so that a single system would do the work of many legacy AS/400 systems.  This is similar to approach #2, except with re-compilation and migration work.  4.  FSA wishes to solicit any other relevant available options that could remove the physical security vulnerability while ensuring successful program delivery.  Desirable characteristics include:  Ability to run all existing applications and Query 36 without modification, Support combined AS/400 S/36 environment (DDM, ILAN, STRM36PRC, RUN400, etc.), Support AS/400 software, including Websphere 3.5, MQ Series, DFS, QPasa, Ability to implement without recompiling code  (Recompiling will add difficulty and complexity), Minimal changes for the FSA software developers.  FSA will continue to develop in the S/36 environment, Ability to address scaling and namespace issues, Ability to connect each remote user to the correct partition/namespace/data, Correct printing of reports, User experience and performance similar to current environment, Minimal downtime, at least comparable to current environment, Ad hoc report capability; Query 36 is preferred.

                                   EXPATRIATES (JUNE 2006). 

    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of Public Law 107?296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ?more than 50 percent? for ?at least 80 percent? each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107?296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)? 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held? 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107?296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107?296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  
The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.
