As a result, CM Computer is uniquely qualified toprovide the required chassis configuration. No equivalent computer can be obtained fromany other source which meets the specific combination of requirements.

These aspects are vital to thisinstant action, allowing for delivery of tested and certified chassis and COTSconfiguration, all of which are critical to the SOFIA early science schedule. Failure toacquire the chassis by January 31, 2009 will adversely impact other SOFIA tasks dependenton the chassis installation.

The supplies/services requested in this justification are for additional licenses for the Metastorm products already in use.  This purchase also includes support that will provide technical assistance from the vendor and product upgrades during the maintenance period (1 year). As publisher of MBPMS, Metastorm is the sole provider of support and maintenance of the product.  Metastorm has been able to make available to DS/CTO product and subject matter experts.  The in-person and remote availability and support of Metastorm personnel have been a valuable part of the overall adoption and use of MBPMS within DS.

<DESC>In accordance with rulemaking activity that is not yet complete, the FAA may use an auction to allocate leases for a certain number of slots at New York's three main airports: John F. Kennedy (JFK), Newark (EWR), and LaGuardia (LGA). If the FAA decides to conduct auctions, the number of slots to be allocated via auction will be specified in the final rule and may be supplemented by additional capacity and/or slots returned to the FAA.  As specified in the proposed Congestion Management Rule for LaGuardia Airport and the proposed Congestion Management Rule for John F. Kennedy International Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport, FAA anticipates, if the rule is adopted, conducting an auction of slot leases at these airports once a year over a five year period.
The FAA requests feedback on the proposed procedures attached by October 1, 2008.  In addition, the FAA appreciates any comments addressing the specific questions that are also attached.  Comments should be addressed via e-mail to Dr. Jeffrey Wharff at Jeffrey.wharff@faa.gov with a copy to the contracting officer at tim.spencer@faa.gov.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for test and flight motors for the Urine ProcessorAssembly (UPA). NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Kollmorgen Corporation, a division ofDanaher Corporation. Kollmorgen motors have been used in the development of the UPA since the beginning of thedevelopment of the vapor compress distillation process allowing a great deal of groundtest data and Vapor Compression Distillation Flight Experiment (VCD FE) data to becollected. The ground test data and motor life data is invaluable for an assembly thathas an expected life of ten (10) years. As such, Kollmorgen motors have been usedexclusively in the UPA.  They are used in the Pressure Control and Pump Assembly (PCPA)flight and test units, the Fluids Control and Pump Assembly (FCPA) flight and test units,and the Distillation Assembly (DA) flight and test units.  These motors are also used inthe test units used to evaluate the Firmware Controller Assemblys (FCA) performance.This is critical since the test units emulate the PCPA, FCPA, and DA during these tests. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note26.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon Friday, September 30, 2008.	Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solelyfor the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on acompetitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed efforton a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solelywithin the discretion of the government.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for one Custom 40 Diameter Zenith PTFE Lined Luminance/ Radiance Integrating Sphere.	Specifications for the sphere include the following:  1. The sphere must be a 40" diameter aluminum shell lined with polytetrafluoroethylene(PTFE). The 40" sphere diameter is needed to accommodate higher operating temperatures,foregoing the need to cool the source and to provide a stable output with shorter warm-upperiod. The aluminum shell is required to enable the sphere to reach equilibrium colortemperature stability in less than 1 hour at 412 nm. PTFE is required due to its highreflectance across the ultraviolet, visible, near infrared and shortwave infraredwavelength regions, its durability, and its non-hygroscopic properties. Provided it iskept clean, PTFE does not require replacement or recoating. In the event of acontamination event, PTFE can be easily cleaned.2. The non-uniformity of the output of the sphere must be 1% or less over the outputaperture. Moreover, given the uniformity specifications and in order to accommodatefacility customers with instruments with wide FOVs, a spherical PTFE interior, whichconforms to the shape of the interior spherical aluminum shell, is essential. Based onlaboratory measurements, approaches which attempt to approximate a spherical interiorusing a series of flat PTFE panels are not acceptable.3. The lamp ports must be of modular design to allow conversion to lamps of other wattageand types (e.g. from tungsten halogen to xenon).4. Long term (i.e. hours after warm-up) radiance stability of the sphere must be equal toor better than 0.2% at 412 nm.5. The sphere must provide radiance output equal or greater than 2500 W/m2 sr m at itspeak wavelength output (i.e. at an approx. wavelength of 1 m). / (See Attached)6. The sphere must include an external lamp housing with an attenuator, to allownear-continuous radiant output between sphere lamp radiance levels.NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items from SphereOptics, LLC pursuant to FAR 13.106,for the acquisition of supplies or services determined to be reasonably available fromonly one source.  SphereOptics, LLC meets our measurement applications and facilitycustomer radiometric calibration requirements for dynamic range, stability, anduniformity. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12, and the SimplifiedAcquisition Procedures set forth in FAR Part 13, via The Test Program for CertainCommercial Items (FAR 13.5) Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon September 22, 2008.	Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the government.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the agency.An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

(b) Submission of offers. Submit signed and dated offers to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this solicitation. Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show- (1) The solicitation number; (2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers; (3) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror; (4) A technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation. This may include product literature, or other documents, if necessary; (5) Terms of any express warranty; (6) Price and any discount terms; (7) ?Remit to? address, if different than mailing address; (8) A completed copy of the representations and certifications at FAR 52.212-3 (see FAR 52.212-3(b) for those representations and certifications that the offeror shall complete electronically; (9) Acknowledgment of Solicitation Amendments; (10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information); and (11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration. (c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation. (d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender's request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing. (e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately. (f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers. (1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due. (2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is ?late? and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and- (A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infra-structure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or (B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or (C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received. (ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted. (3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel. (4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. (5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer. (g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. (h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the offer. (i) Availability of requirements documents cited in the solicitation. (k) Central Contractor Registration. Unless exempted by an addendum to this solicitation, by submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation. If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror. Offerors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757. (l) Debriefing.

Background:The Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) is a safety-critical system that provides accurate precise navigation and landing guidance to equipped aircraft in any weather. The WAAS augments the United States Government (USG) Global Positioning System (GPS) and Standard Positioning Service (SPS). The primary mission of the WAAS is to provide a means for air navigation during all phases of flight in the National Airspace System (NAS); departure, en route and approach.  The WAAS augments GPS with the following three services: a ranging function, which improves availability and reliability; differential GPS corrections, which improve accuracy; and integrity monitoring, which improves safety.  
The Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS) is a ground-based augmentation to GPS that focuses its service on the airport area (approximately a 20-30 mile radius) for precision approach, departure procedures and terminal area operations. It broadcasts its correction message via a very high frequency (VHF) radio data link from a ground-based transmitter. LAAS will yield the extremely high accuracy, availability, and integrity necessary for Category I, II, and III precision approaches, and will provide the ability for flexible, curved approach paths. 
Scope of Work:In support of WAAS Phase III, significant technical refresh and reliability modifications will occur.  These modifications include development of an engineering model reference receiver that is L1C, L2C and L5 capable; improved WAAS processing for ionospheric estimation, scintillation robustness, and signal quality (evil waveform) monitoring; and incorporation of additional geostationary satellites and associated ground facilities.  
Integration of these enhancements must be seamless to WAAS users.  The system must continue to satisfy the stringent integrity requirements demanded of this safety of life navigation service. Integration of the new Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites into WAAS requires knowledge of signal generation simulation and modeling.  
To satisfy the above requirements, versatile systems engineering support as well as an in-depth understanding of the WAAS architecture and integrity design are required. The FAA requires senior systems engineering support for WAAS.  As well as, dedicated technical engineering support to GNSS modernization and LAAS.  The following tasks provide additional details on support activities sought by the FAA. It should be noted that inherent in these tasks are requirements for detailed knowledge of GPS receiver signal processing and design, an equivalent understanding of GNSS measurement processing and integrity algorithms,  and a mature GPS receiver and antenna test capability including access to an anechoic chamber.  Additionally, contractors shall have a demonstrated Radio Frequency (RF) interference survey, investigation capability and participation in forums on RF interference and GNSS modernization. 
An in-depth, thorough, comprehensive knowledge of WAAS and LAAS corrections generation, processing threads, integrity design, and an analytical support for WAAS modifications is required.
The ability to perform this work with a minimal to no learning curve is required. 
The FAA intends to award this contract as a Cost Plus-Fixed Fee type. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes for these efforts are 541330, 541511, 541611, 541614, 561110, 541990 and 541712.

BACKGROUND
The National Institutes of Health (NIH), an Operating Division within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary Federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research.  Helping to lead the way toward important medical discoveries that improve people’s health, NIH scientists investigate ways to prevent disease, as well as the causes, treatments, and cures for common and rare diseases.

NIH research impacts:
• child and teen health, 
• men's health, 
• minority health, 
• seniors' health, 
• women's health, and 
• wellness and lifestyle issues. 

Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.  For over a century, the National Institutes of Health has played an important role in improving the health of the nation. 

The goals of the Agency are as follows: 
1. foster fundamental creative discoveries, innovative research strategies, and their applications as a basis to advance significantly the Nation's capacity to protect and improve health; 
2. develop, maintain, and renew scientific human and physical resources that will assure the Nation's capability to prevent disease; 
3. expand the knowledge base in medical and associated sciences in order to enhance the Nation's economic well-being and ensure a continued high return on the public investment in research; and 
4. exemplify and promote the highest level of scientific integrity, public accountability, and social responsibility in the conduct of science. 

In realizing these goals, the NIH provides leadership and direction to programs designed to improve the health of the Nation by conducting and supporting research: 
• in the causes, diagnosis, prevention, and cure of human diseases; 
• in the processes of human growth and development; 
• in the biological effects of environmental contaminants; 
• in the understanding of mental, addictive and physical disorders; and 
• in directing programs for the collection, dissemination, and exchange of information in medicine and health, including the development and support of medical libraries and the training of medical librarians and other health information specialists.

Approximately 95% of all tasks are long-term for continuing performance in excess of six (6) months; however, there may be a need for intermittent tasks with flexible hours.  The majority will require full-time work; however, there may be a need for part-time services and overtime.  Part-time and overtime needs will be defined on the individual task order award documents.

This is not a new requirement.  The current contractor is Kelly Services. which provides approximately 1000 contractor employees providing long-term support to twenty-four (24) of the twenty-seven (27) NIH institutes and centers however it is anticipated that need will increase further over time.
 
The tasks require a broad skill range across the entire spectrum of employment categories.  The division of skill categories is subject to change but currently follows the approximate breakdown below:

Scientific  -                                  47%,

The subject requirement will provide for chemical engineering and other scientific technical support for EPA' s Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, Economics, Exposure, & Technology Division (OPPT/EETD).  The activities of the Office require a number of different types of analyses to be performed; including assessments of hazard, exposure, risk, pollution prevention opportunities, and the economic impact of proposed regulatory actions.  
The Chemical Engineering Branch (CEB) is one of several groups within the OPPT/EETD that provide technical support to these programs.  CEB's areas of expertise include the characterization of methods for manufacturing and using industrial chemicals; and assessments of the potential for occupational exposure and environmental releases resulting from these industrial operations.  This anticipated contract will primarily provide support for activities performed by the Chemical Engineering Branch (CEB).  The services are currently performed by the incumbent, Eastern Research Group, Inc. (ERG), under EPA contract #EP-W-05-014.  Notwithstanding the Government's option to exercise term extensions, the current contract is scheduled to expire on 31 January 2010.

Interested parties should be concise in their capability statements, and limit responses to no more than 15 pages.  Capability statements must be responsive to all information items requested herein to allow for an accurate business assessment.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to negotiate a sole source procurement under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, only one responsible source with Yankee Equipment, 1 Glass Lane, Barrington, NH for a Chicago Edge Maxx Corneless Spreader/Feeder.  Contractor must provide the following:Product description:Spreader-feeder must provide end to end ironing of flat sheets at a maximum of 1800 sheets per hour using a clipless system.  By virtue of the clipless system, less staff hours are required for production.  This spreader-feeder will record the production rate of each employee and provides a full-length lighting system for inspection, improving quality control.  It also provides pacing lights that will indicate if the machine is functioning at the present rate as selected by management.  This machine gives the option of functioning with one or two employees.  An automatic floor return reject conveyor brings misfed items back to the front center for convenient removal and eliminates the operator retrieving from the far end of the ironer.  The spreader-feeder, sheets must not drag across the floor prior to entering the machine (ironer).  The clip on systems allows sheets to drag on the floor and this has been cited by several JCAHO inspectors in the past as a sanitation challenge and by OSHA as a tripping hazard to employees feeding the ironer.The applicable NAICS code for this solicitation is 423440. The standard size in number of employees is 100. This procurement is based on the determination that the Government's minimum needs can best be satisfied by supplies available from this entity. This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. The Government does not intend to pay for information solicited. The submission of any data for review shall not impede award of this contract as planned. Interested parties may identify their qualifications/capabilities by detailing their experience in providing this service, to the Contracting Officer, by e-mail to Kimberly.Perkins3@va.gov . Such qualifications/capabilities will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Oral communications are not acceptable and responses received after September 22, 2008 at 4:00pm will not be considered. JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION	1.  Identification of the agency and the contracting activity.	VA Medical Center, VISN Laundry, Brockton, MA*2.  Nature and/or description of the action being approved.Sole Source procurement of the following: Chicago Edge Maxx Corrnerless Spreader/Feeder*3.  Description of the supplies or services required to meet the      agency's needs (including the estimated value).	Please include the IFCAP transaction number, dollar value and	a description of the item being sought.	Description: Cornerless Spreader/Feeder (2 fte will not be required to feed large linen items, such as sheets, into machine as corner clipping of items will not be required for items to be processed).  4.  Identification of the statutory authority permitting other    t	han full and open competition.	FAR 6.302-1, USC 253(c)(1) Only One Responsible Source,*5.  Demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the     	authority sited. 1.	Unlike any other feeding systems the Edge Maxx feeder is a cornerless feeding system, therefore an employee does not need to take the time to find corners of flatwork in order to feed the item.  2.	Because this cornerless feeder device only offered by Chicago Dryer (patented) eliminates the potential pulling of sheets-end to end, (clip on system) it virtually eliminates the premature tearing of sheets, therefore conceptually sheets last longer before being disposed of (fair-wear and tear reduced)3.	To achieve production requirements of up to 1,800 pieces per hour the number of employees required to accommodate this feeding requirement is eliminated from 4-5 FTEE-feeding and pulling to 2-3 FTEE (feeding and pulling), a potential savings in FTEE of 2 to 3, at $35,000 salary including benefits per year a savings of $70,000 annually. Over the approximate life of 12 years for the feeder that represents a savings (cost avoidance of $840,000).	4.	Because of the patented designs of the Edge Maxx sheets do not drag across the floor prior to entering the machine (ironer).  The clip on systems do allow sheets to drag on the floor and this has been cited by several JCAHO        inspectors in the past as a sanitation challenge and by   OSHA as a tripping hazard to employees feeding the ironer.5.	The Edge Maxx Feeder is currently used by numerous VA facilities and has been purchased recently as a sole source item in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations without any industry challenges by VAMC Oklahoma City, St. Albans (Brooklyn), West Los Angeles and Perry Point MD.*6.  Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are 	Solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a Commerce Business Daily notice was or will be published.Advertised on FEDBIZ.	The following vendors were contacted, however were unable to 	provide these services.	1.  Vendor holds patent on "Cornerless System".	2.	3.	4.7.  Determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated     cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.To be determined at date of award.8.  Description of the market survey conducted (i.e., names, of    firms and the date(s) the firms were contacted) and the     results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not    conducted.Advertised on GSA through E-Buy*9.  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and 	open competition, such as an explanation why technical data     packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, 	statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for 	full and open competition have not been developed or are not 	available.See Question 510.  A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing,      an interest in the acquisition.None to date11.  A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to        remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any         subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.This contracting activity will continue to encourage full and open competition whenever possible.

The equipment will be used for the trace analysis of classified compounds of military interest.  This equipment will allow the greatest sensitivity for the analysis and provide data on trace analysis of surfaces to determine residual contamination density.  This data is required to determine residual contamination level on military relevant matrices.<BR><BR>In the analysis of a classified compound currently the subject of an intense effort with the Environmental Chemical Biological Command, the Chemical Methodology team did an internal round robbin to determine the instrument platform which would give us the government  sensitive analysis.  This comparison test was with the specific compound under study, not with standards in the unclassified arena.  Since this software is proprietary to Agilent this cannot be done with the other vendor's platforms.<BR><BR><BR><BR>

<CONTACT>
<DESC>The Naval Inventory Control Point (NAVICP)intends to award a sole-source 8(a), firm fixed price purchase order for brand name foundry hardware. This notice does not constitute a request for quote, but posts the brand name justification and approval in accordance with FAR 5.102(a)(6). The brand name J&A is shown below:
 JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVALFOR USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION- BRAND NAME

1.	Identification of Requesting Agency and Contracting Office:
a.	Agency Name:	       Superintendent, Naval Post Graduate School (NPS)Information Technology Center (ITACS)555 Dyer's Rd, Bldg 330 RM 130Monterey CA   93943
b.	Contracting Activity:	       Naval Inventory Control Point (NAVICP)5450 Carlisle PikeMechanicsburg PA  17055-0788
2.	Nature/Description of the action:
	This brand name justification and approval is for the acquisition of a Network Operation Upgrade.  This action will provide the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) Network Operations the ability to finalize the CORE and BDF (Building Distribution Frames) upgrade to 10 GIG and IPV6 capable equipment, and Wireless deployment for academic use. 
3.	Description of supplies/services:
As stated above, this procurement is for an information technology solution as opposed to a purchase of a simple commodity. It is the intent of the requestor to purchase Foundry network equipment and configurations in support of the 10 GIG, increased support for data and voice services, and IPv6 network upgrade.  These new systems upgrades will replace the existing Foundry network switches that have reached their end-of-life and create a standardized base of network equipment meeting the JITC (Joint Interoperability Test Command) ASVALAN (Assured Services Voice Application Local Area Network) certification and requirements. This action will replace existing equipment necessary to provide the foundation for essential services and research at the NPS.  
4.	Identification of Statutory Authority:	
10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) - Only one source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

5.	Demonstration of Contractor's Unique Qualifications:
(a) Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(c), an acquisition that uses a brand name description or other purchase description to specify a particular brand name, product, or feature of a product, peculiar to one manufacturer does not provide for full and open competition regardless of the number of sources solicited.  It shall be justified and approved in accordance with FAR 6.303 and 6.304.
(b) The use of a brand name description in this acquisition is essential to the Government's requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company.  The hardware is a commercial item that has been sold, leased, or licensed to the general public. After much analysis, NPS Network Operations has determined that standardizing on Foundry NetIron MLX, FastIron SX, FGS/FLS and FES systems and configuration is the only viable way to complete the network upgrade to 10 GIG and IPv6 capable network. The equipment requested will provide additional 10 GIG capability for the CORE and BDFS, and additional copper connections at the CORE to connect the new telephone system. 6.	Government wide Point of Entry Notice/potential source:
The proposed contract will be synopsized in accordance with FAR 5.101(a) (1) and posted at the Government Wide Point of Entry.
7.	Determination of fair and reasonable costs:
This acquisition is being conducted as a small business set aside, in accordance with the provisions of FAR Part 13.5, "Test Program for Certain Commercial Items."  All applicable procurement regulations will be followed.  The Contracting Officer will determine the prices to be fair and reasonable.
8.	Description of market survey:
In the previous contract with Trofholz Technologies, Inc. (FISC San Diego Contract Ref # N00244-08-C-0980), it was determined that Foundry equipment provided the network services and scalability to NPS's present and future needs. Extensive market research was done during this procurement process and numerous commercial offerings were evaluated. Based on the results, it was determined that Foundry equipment was best value. 
9.	Other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:
None at this time.  10.  Actions to remove barriers to competition:
The proposed contract will be synopsizes in accordance with FAR 5.101(a)(1). 
11.  Statement of Delivery Requirements:
       a.  Delivery Requirements: Delivery shall be within 30 days from the effective date of the              purchase order for the hardware being acquired.

       b. Reference to Approved Acquisition Plan:  Not Required.
       c. Reference to ADP Approvals: Not required.
       d. Documentation for Spares and Repair Parts Acquisition: Not applicable.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.     This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is FDA1041160 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 05-26. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 519 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.

	The goal of this project is the development and implementation of a secure 	research portal for the ECG Warehouse operated for FDA.  The research portal 	concept is a means whereby a researcher can pose a question to the ECG 	Warehouse in some formal programming language and get a suitably formatted 	response. Depending on the researcher’s permissions, the response for some 	ECGs might be in the form of summary statistics, rather than ECG-by-ECG 	results. The ECG-level results should be retained for any production run analyses.

I.	Requirements gathering:  The Research Portal needs to serve the needs of a diverse research community. The research community needs to have input into desirable features of the portal, including manner of uploading requests, monitoring progress of procedures being run on their behalf, programming language(s) to be supported, library of functions available for common input, output, and computational tasks, and manner of retrieving results. The community whose input needs to be sought includes, at a minimum, FDA researchers and project leaders with the Cardiac Safety Research Consortium.

II.	Development and implementation plan:  The requirements need to be captured in an overall project development and implementation plan agreeable to the FDA PI.

III.	Development and implementation:  The development needs to be prioritized, staged, and prototyped. There needs to be a core group of test users to review functionality compared with the requirements. There needs to be a process for evaluating and implementing change requests.

IV.	Progress reporting:  Contractor will provide monthly reports on project status and open issues needing to be resolved.

V.	Final documentation and training:  On-site training at FDA will be performed for up to 12 FDA and external researchers. Documentation and training materials are needed.  Period of performance:  One year starting soon after response date 

VI.	DELIVERABLES:  Requirements gathering, Development and implementation plan	,  Development and implementation, Progress reporting, Final documentation and training

<p><br />52.219-28 POST-AWARD SMALL BUSINESS PROGRAM REREPRESENTATION (JUNE 2007)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause--</p>
<p>Long-term contract means a contract of more than five years in duration, including options. However, the term does not include contracts that exceed five years in duration because the period of performance has been extended for a cumulative period not to exceed six months under the clause at 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, or other appropriate authority.</p>
<p>Small business concern means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the criteria in 13 CFR part 121 and the size standard in paragraph (c) of this clause.</p>
<p>(b) If the Contractor represented that it was a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor shall rerepresent its size status according to paragraph (e) of this clause or, if applicable, paragraph (g) of this clause, upon the occurrence of any of the following:</p>
<p>(1) Within 30 days after execution of a novation agreement or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the novation agreement was executed prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.</p>
<p>(2) Within 30 days after a merger or acquisition that does not require a novation or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the merger or acquisition occurred prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.</p>

<p>(i) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract; and</p>
<p>(ii) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the exercise date specified in the contract for any option thereafter.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor shall rerepresent its size status in accordance with the size standard in effect at the time of this rerepresentation that corresponds to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this contract. The small business size standard corresponding to this NAICS code can be found at http://www.sba.gov/services/contractingopportunities/sizestandardstopics/.</p>
<p>(d) The small business size standard for a Contractor providing a product which it does not manufacture itself, for a contract other than a construction or service contract, is 500 employees.</p>
<p>(e) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this clause, the Contractor shall make the rerepresentation required by paragraph (b) of this clause by validating or updating all its representations in the Online Representations and Certifications Application and its data in the Central Contractor Registration, as necessary, to ensure they reflect current status. The Contractor shall notify the contracting office by e-mail, or otherwise in writing, that the data have been validated or updated, and provide the date of the validation or update.</p>
<p>(f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause.</p>
<p>(g) If the Contractor does not have representations and certifications in ORCA, or does not have a representation in ORCA for the NAICS code applicable to this contract, the Contractor is required to complete the following rerepresentation and submit it to the contracting office, along with the contract number and the date on which the rerepresentation was completed:</p>
<p>The Contractor represents that it ( ) is, ( ) is not a small business concern under NAICS Code - assigned to contract number .</p>
<p>(Contractor to sign and date and insert authorized signer's name and title).</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />52.243-1 CHANGES--FIXED-PRICE (AUG 1987)</p>
<p>(a) The Contracting Officer may at any time, by written order, and without notice to the sureties, if any, make changes within the general scope of this contract in any one or more of the following:</p>
<p>(1) Drawings, designs, or specifications when the supplies to be furnished are to be specially manufactured for the Government in accordance with the drawings, designs, or specifications.</p>
<p>(2) Method of shipment or packing.</p>
<p>(3) Place of delivery.</p>
<p>(b) If any such change causes an increase or decrease in the cost of, or the time required for, performance of any part of the work under this contract, whether or not changed by the order, the Contracting Officer shall make an equitable adjustment in the contract price, the delivery schedule, or both, and shall modify the contract.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor must assert its right to an adjustment under this clause within 30 days from the date of receipt of the written order. However, if the Contracting Officer decides that the facts justify it, the Contracting Officer may receive and act upon a proposal submitted before final payment of the contract.</p>
<p>(d) If the Contractor's proposal includes the cost of property made obsolete or excess by the change, the Contracting Officer shall have the right to prescribe the manner of the disposition of the property.</p>
<p>(e) Failure to agree to any adjustment shall be a dispute under the Disputes clause. However, nothing in this clause shall excuse the Contractor from proceeding with the contract as changed.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is PC-08-Q-RM1 and is issued as a Request for Quotation. The Peace Corps anticipates awarding a competitive fixed-price purchase order for:

Multimedia Overview

Instructors should be able to walk into Shriver Hall and electronically project their computer &/or video presentation without any special preparation.   

The conference room is designed to accommodate five (5) ceiling mounted projection systems, which are broken down as follows:

Two (2) in Shriver A, one (1) in Shriver B and two (2) in Shriver C, each with their own screens.  The projectors must be able to project on a screen of 12 x 15.

Phase one consists of replacing the existing projectors in Shriver Hall with new, updated models.  This will require purchase and installation, to include all mounting hardware and cable routing with labeling. 

There are a total of five (5) projectors that will need to be replaced.  The projectors are to be Christie Digital brand, Model LX-55 (or bulb compatible equivalent), which will match the projectors currently installed at Peace Corps headquarters.  Four new projectors will need to be provided by the contractor.  The Peace Corps will provide one of the projectors as government furnished equipment.  After the projectors have been mounted, they will need to be aligned and properly configured for optimal viewing.

For phase two, the contractor shall provide and install three touch control panels (one for each of the rooms).  The touch panels will need to meet requirements listed under control system heading of this Statement of Work (SOW).

Control System

•	Motorized Projection Screens 
•	(5) Christie LX55  Projectors (or bulb compatible equivalent) with  motorized ceiling mount controlled by remote with a mandatory ‘mute’ mode for the projectors
•	Presenter Computer inputs (or wireless keyboard if using in rack computer)
•	DVD / VHS Recorder / Player with inputs for other video sources 
•	Video Mixer/Switcher 
•	Lighting, and electrically controlled shades.



The requirements for the touch panels are as follows:

•	Must be at least 7 3/16" x 10 1/2" x 1 5/16" in size
•	Wireless capability
•	Docking station

The programming source codes (with full rights) as well as all schematics shall be provided to the Peace Corps along with labeling of all cabling and must be approved by the Peace Corps point of contact upon completion of project. 

Contractor shall coordinate with Peace Corps Facilities personnel within 5 business days of award to confirm requirements and work out available installation dates.

<DESC>This synopsis is for the “Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) Homeland Security Consulting Services” requirement.  This synopsis is prepared in accordance with FAR part(s) 6.302 -1, “Only one responsible source”.  This synopsis gives notice of the Government’s intent to negotiate and issue a sole source contract in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1) and Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 6.302-1 entitled "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.”  This contract is necessary to provide a continuation of critical services until the recompetition of the “Homeland Security Consulting Services” requirement is complete.  The Government intends to award a sole source contract to Mr. Arlan Van Doorn located at 614 Ninovan Road, Vienna, VA  22180, the incumbent contractor.   Mr. Van Doorn has been providing the critical, highly specialized services described above to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) since April 18, 2006.  The existing contract is scheduled to expire on September 30, 2008.  The current contract is being extended to cover a period of performance of twelve (12) months starting October 1, 2008 through September 30, 2009.  Interested vendors may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by addressing how it would be able to perform the interim services from October 1, 2008 until the recompetition is issued.

However, all capability statements received within 15 calendar days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered by the FCC.  A determination by the FCC not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the FCC.

<DESC>The FCC seeks grass roots organizations and community-based organizations to help educate consumers, assist with converter box procurement and installation, establish and staff help centers, and conduct post-deadline assistance.  Based on the experience of other countries that have gone through the transition, it appears that a large amount of activity takes place two to four weeks before the transition deadline and then two weeks after the deadline.  Therefore, planning with grass roots organizations and community-based organizations through March 2009 is extremely important.

Specific actions to achieve the objectives may include any one or combination of the following key tasks:


•	Procurement of DTV Converter Boxes.  Assistance to consumers in obtaining DTV converter boxes and related equipment from retailers (this contract does not provide for the cost of converter boxes or related equipment).  

•	Installation of Converter Boxes.  Assistance to consumers with the installation of the converter boxes and related equipment.

•	Establishment of Help Centers.  Establishment of help centers for consumers seeking information regarding the DTV transition and related equipment issues.



Post-DTV Transition Deadline Assistance.  Assistance to consumers beyond the termination of full power analog broadcasting on February 17, 2008, including technical assistance regarding converter box operations. 
Outreach to Identified Target Television Markets.  Outreach to Areas Identified in the FCC’s Nationwide Initiative Targeting 81 Cities.  Grass roots and community-based organizations may propose to conduct outreach, install converter boxes, establish help centers and conduct post-DTV deadline assistance in any one, combination of or all of the cities included in the FCC’s Nationwide Initiative for DTV Outreach announced on August 18, 2008.  Details on this August 18 announcement and the list of 81 cities can be found at www.dtv.gov or 
http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-284629A1.pdf.

In addition to the key tasks under this contract, the organizations must have the ability to:

•	Obtain full and complete knowledge of:
o	The FCC’s and NTIA’s educational materials 
o	The FCC’s www.dtv.gov website
o	NTIA’s website www.DTV2009.gov
•	Ensure appropriate messaging throughout the outreach campaign.
•	Provide the necessary resources to meet the task requirements.
•	Maintain full technical coordination and interchange of information with FCC program management team.
•	Provide real time access to program status and performance.
•	Meet program objectives while providing innovative and flexible management of project cost, schedule, performance, risks, and subcontracts.
•	If sub-contracting is to be utilized, it shall be done through effective teaming arrangements.
•	Provide feedback on and demonstration of success of outreach effort.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.The proposed contract action is for the Mediwatch Encompass Pelvic Floor urodynamic testing system for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1  'Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements'.  The use of a brand name specification is essential to the Government's requirements and precludes consideration of a product manufactured by another company.  The VA has a requirement for a urodynamic testing system with advanced analysis capabilities and integrated patient information.  The equipment must use the Windows operating system and Microsoft Office applications to export reports and data to allow the results of urodynamic investigations to be captured into the VA CPRS system. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer vendor questions.  As a result, the solicitation is hereby amended as follows:

1. Question: We believe the pattern name with 100 is for checking the resolution capability in a small writing field.  Please confirm the purpose of the pattern name with 1000?

Answer:  The 1000 GDS pattern file is for checking the resolution capability in a 1000 um x 1000 um exposure area,  whereas the 100 GDS pattern file is for checking the resolution capability in a 100 um x 100 um exposure area.

2. Question:  In both sets of GDS data, the cross-mark figure exists within the chip.  Please confirm if that cross-mark is for the pattern placement accuracy measurement or just a reference mark.

Answer:  The cross-marks are used to obtain statistics on the pattern placement accuracy of the e-beam used to expose the pattern.

<p>It is anticipated that a firm fixed price contract will be issued for this requirement. All Contract Line Items (CLIN's) must be offered on to be considered for award. Award will go to the responsive, responsible small business concern who offers the lowest cumulative price  and conforms to the requirements contained herein. Prices are being sought for two (2) different types of Electromechanical Cable  (CLIN's 0001 and 0002) . The offeror shall provide a firm fixed price quote for one (1) quantity for CLIN 0001 and two (2) quantity for CLIN 0002. Quotations shall be firm fixed price offers for the following:</p>
<p><strong>CLIN 0001 (Quantity One (1) 0.322" Electromechanical Cable): Introduction:</strong> The Pacific Marine Center uses electromechanical cable to lower various scientific instruments over the side of their oceangoing research vessels.  The cables support the instruments and provide the means for electrical signals to pass between the instruments and the vessel.  It is typically called "CTD wire".The following specifications describe the significant characteristics the cable design must have.  General: An electromechanical cable is required to lower various scientific instruments over the side of an oceangoing research vessel.  The cable shall be capable of safely lowering an instrument to 6,000 m water depth in the dynamic environment caused by ship and wave motion, and lowering/raising speeds of 70 m/min.  Multiple conductors are required for the real time transmission of electrical data and control signals and for redundancy.  The cable shall be capable of being stored under tension for five years on single drum winches to multiple layers.  Resistance to crushing is required.  It is expected that payloads will frequently produce loading of the cable (both static + dynamic) approaching 50% of rated breaking strength&yuml;(RBS). The cable will be used with LEBUS grooved drum shell.  The cable must be compatible with existing LEBUS grooved shells for a Markey DESH-5, 38" width drum. <strong>Characteristics: 1) </strong>Maximum strength attainable is identified as the best possible ratio of strength to weight.  The ability of a cable to "survive" under extreme conditions is a function of its Rated or Ultimate Breaking Strain.  Minimum breaking strength is 10,000 lbs, free end <strong>2)</strong> Highest elastic limit attainable -- identified as the best possible ratio of elastic limit to weight.  This characteristic controls the mix of payload size, wire out, wire speed and environmental conditions at which the cable can operate with safety.  This applies to both strength and electrical components of the cable.  Elongation of no greater than 1.0 ft/kft/klbf.<strong> 3)</strong> High rotational stability is identified as a minimal amount of axial rotation under loads cyclically varying from 0% to 45% of RBS.  Low rotation is considered necessary to avoid looping/hockling the cable on bottom contact or "Zero" tension conditions and to prevent excessive spinning of lowered instruments.  Maximum amount acceptable is 15 degrees/ft. <strong>4) </strong>High degree of armor stress balance is identified as the absence or near absence of variations to the relative loading on inner and outer armors that produce strength degradation when one end of the cable is free to rotate. <strong>5)</strong> Minimum service life of 5 years.  <strong>6) </strong>Cable shall be capable of operating at: greater than 30% RBS for 90% of expected life and greater than 40% RBS for 70% of expected life. <strong>7)</strong> The cable shall be able to withstand occasional loading to 50% RBS without reduction in strength or change in electrical characteristics. <strong>8) </strong>The armor shall be galvanized. <strong>9)</strong> The cable shall have a finished O.D. of 8.1788 mm (0.322"). <strong>10)</strong> The cable shall be in  one  unbroken length of 8000 m (without splices).  <strong>11)</strong> The cable shall be capable of operation with single drum winch systems where the cable is stored under tension. <strong>12) </strong>The cable shall be able to operate continuously (useful life) over sheaves not less than (NLT) 40 times the cable diameter without degradation in strength.  <strong>13)</strong> The cable must be capable of withstanding repeated flexures over sheaves at the nominal working loads given in item 6 without degradation in strength or change in electrical characteristics. <strong>14) </strong>The cable shall be capable of withstanding cyclical loading in tension as results from ship motion without degradation in strength or change in electrical characteristics. <strong>15) </strong>The cable shall not unlay when cut, i.e. it must be well preformed. <strong>16) </strong>The cable shall be lubricated for abrasion and corrosion protection.  The lubricant should not extrude in use and be of non-petroleum base. <strong>17)</strong> The cable shall have multiple electrical conductors capable of efficient transmission of low power signals at frequencies less than 20 kHz.  Cable design should be optimized to permit simultaneous transmission of 5 kHz and 10 kHz signals in a single conductor to armor circuit.  <strong>Performance Specifications: 1) </strong>Finished Diameter: - The finished diameter shall be 8.1788 mm (0.322") at a loading of 15% of RBS.  The diameter shall be uniform over the length of the cable with tolerances of (&Auml;0.0508 mm (0.002") and +0.076 mm (0.003")). <strong>2) </strong>Working Diameter: - The change in cable diameter due to a change in cable loading shall not exceed 2% of the finish diameter.  At a loading of 50% RBS the cable diameter shall not be less than 8.03 mm (0.316)".   <strong>3)</strong> Rotation: - The finished cable should not rotate about its axis more than 65 degrees per meter at 40% of RBS.  It is recognized that this requirement may not be met given the specified outer armor wire size and minimum sheave diameter. <strong>4)</strong> Rated Breaking Strength: 4500 Kg (10000 lbs) with one end free to rotate.  <strong>5)</strong> Flexure Tolerance: - Withstand &gt; 50,000 flexure cycles over sheaves 40 times wire O.D. at 35-40% of RBS without failure of individual wires or degradation of electrical performance.  Degradation in strength shall not exceed 5% of RBS.  <strong>6)</strong> Tension Cycling: - Withstand &gt; 50,000 cycles in tension from 10% to 40% of RBS at an 8 sec. period without failure of individual wires or degradation of electrical performance.  Degradation in strength shall not exceed 5% of RBS.  <strong>7)</strong> Sheave Size: - The cable shall be capable of operation with sheaves of tread diameter 38 cm (15"). <strong>8) </strong>Cable Length: - The cable shall of an unbroken lengths of 8,050 m without splices.  <strong>9)</strong> Armor Wires: - The armor wires shall be galvanized and have the following characteristics: Tensile Strength: greater than Extra Improved Plow Steel; Ductility:	greater than of XIPS; Armor: both inner and outer armor wires to have a diameter greater than  0.813 mm (0.032") SGXXIPS <strong>10) </strong>Belt: - The conductor package shall be jacketed with 0.381 mm (0.015") Hytrel to protect the conductors from armor abrasion.  <strong>11)</strong> Electrical: - The cable shall be constructed with 3 stranded copper wire conductors sized #20 AWG or larger, #19 AWG 19/0.203 mm (0.008") bare copper with 0.406 mm (0.016") wall polypropylene, each of which shall have the following electrical characteristics: Conductor Resistance: greater than 32.8 ohms/1000 m.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to incorporate the following Questions and Answers and to extend the due date to Tuesday, September 24, 2008 at 5:00PM (EST).

Q1: Under the Schedule of Supplies and Services, it states that “The Peace Corps reserves the right to award a contract for services performed in one country or multiple countries subject to funding at the firm fixed price proposed by vendors.”  However, Attachment 1 clearly indicates that one of the three countries will be selected for evaluation activities.  Please confirm whether the technical and cost proposals should cover one or three countries.

A1: One of the three countries will be selected.  Vendors may propose one country or multiple countries. 

Q2: The SOW, on page 4 and 7 indicates that Peace Corps will select the country in which the evaluation will be conducted.  Given the different language requirements of the three countries, is the offerer expected to propose key personnel who would be able to work in any one of the three countries?  In other words, do we have to propose personnel with Spanish and French language skills?

A2:  Vendor should propose key personnel in accordance with RFQ. 

Q3: On page 4 of the Attachment 1, it states that Peace Corps will conduct the pre-fieldwork activities, including drafting and finalizing the data collection instruments.  On page 8, it indicates that the Contractor will be responsible for this same task.  Please clarify which party will be responsible for the drafting and finalizing of instruments.
 
A3: As stated on page four, “it is recognized that the contractor, in collaboration with Peace Corps, shall finalize the research design, methodology, standards of evidence, measures, and data collection instruments during the first week of the evaluation.”  Vendor shall draft and finalize the data collection instruments.
 
Q4: There is no Activity item for pilot testing the data collection instruments.  We believe that this is a critical task, since making changes and improvements to the instruments after researchers have been trained and partway through the data collection process is very disruptive and inefficient.  Could you please address this issue, indicating what the reasons were for not including a pilot test of the instruments?
 
A4: As stated in RFQ, work plan information was provided for illustrative purposes only.  Vendors may propose alternate work plans.  
 
Q5: The 3-5 weeks allocated for interviewer training and data collection are extremely tight.  In order to be able assess the feasibility of this three week timeline for  interviewer training and fieldwork, we would like to know the maximum number of communities within the country that the contractor and interviewer teams would be required to visit and gather data in.
 
A5: As stated in RFQ, work plan information was provided for illustrative purposes only.  Vendors may propose alternate work plans.  There is no maximum or minimum requirement for the number of communities the vendor shall visit.  Peace Corps estimates that there are on average 40 Volunteers in each study country conducting HIV/AIDS activities and potentially using life skills in the implementation of their activities.  There is generally one Volunteer per community.

All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.

<DESC>DARPASN08-51 HAS BEEN MODIFIED AND THE CHANGES INCORPORATED.  

THIS MODIFICATION SUPERSEDES THE PREVIOUS NOTICE POSTED SEPTEMBER 02 2008.

Special Notice DARPASN08-51QUANTUM EFFECTS IN BIOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENTS (QuBE); WORKSHOP DATE: October 14-15, 2008;   REGISTRATION DEADLINE: October 10, 2008;
TECHNICAL POC: Dr. Matthew Goodman, DARPA/DSO

The Defense Sciences Office (DSO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is hosting a workshop to discuss innovative research that will investigate the way that nature may be exploiting quantum mechanical effects in biological systems.

Manifestly quantum effects have been postulated to have roles in a number of biological systems.  Recently experimental results have demonstrated long-lived quantum coherence in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) Bacteriochlorophyll complex (Nature 446, (2007), 782) and in the purple bacteria reaction center (Science, 316, (2007), 1462).  Furthermore, a quantum algorithm at work in the FMO complex which could have profound implications in the quantum information field.  In addition there may be other examples of quantum effects.  For example, new experimental results have led to the postulate that the magnetic navigation ability of some species of birds is due to the quantum Zeno effect in a photo-responsive protein complex.  

The DARPA QuBE Workshop will be held in the offices of Booz Allen Hamilton at 3811 N. Fairfax Dr., Suite 1000, Arlington, VA, 22203.  The ultimate goal of the workshop is to identify model biological systems and quantum effects for study, and to recommend research directions that would clarify the nature and potential impact of these effects.  The success of this workshop will rely heavily on group discussion of the research challenges across this interdisciplinary topic; as such, it is expected that participants will have relevant research experience.

The workshop will take place on October 14, 2008 between 1:00-7:00 PM, and October 15, 2008 between 9:00 AM - 4:30 PM.  Sign-in and badging will take place on 14 October only; any participants who are not planning to attend the first day of the workshop must notify the organizers in advance.

There is no fee for the QuBE Workshop. Details on the workshop, including registration information, can be found at the following URL: https://www.enstg.com/Signup/default.cfm?ThisCode=QUA47573, conference code QUA47573.

Registration is limited by the venue capacity (maximum of 35 people, maximum 2 from each institution).  The registration cutoff date is October 10, 2008, or at attendance capacity, whichever comes first. If there is additional space available after the registration deadline, institutions will be permitted additional participants on a first-come, first-serve basis.  Further administrative information is available from Ms. Jennifer Thabet (thabet.jennifer@bah.com).  Additional technical information can be obtained from Dr. Matthew Goodman (Matthew.Goodman@darpa.mil).  Please refer to the QuBE Workshop in any correspondence.  This special announcement is not a request for proposals.

This Justification and approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of IBM and CISCO equipment.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of States continued support of the payroll/retirement systems, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. IRM/OPS/SIO has identified the required hardware [an IBM z9 Business Class (BC) Mainframe (2096-N02 processor model series), two (2) IBM DS6800 SANS, two (2) IBM SAN19B-R routers, and two (2) CISCO MDS 922i switch devices] as a key requirement for the Departments continued use/operation of its payroll and retirement software applications.  The equipment listed above is required to maintain the existing Department of States software applications, which is based on the IBM operating software that is needed in order to carry out these functions. The 41 USC 253(c) (1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments continued use/operation of its payroll and retirement systems, which must run on the IBM operating software that is needed in order to carry out these functions. The requirement will be competed as the IT community response to price requests on FedBid. IRM/OPS/SIO has identified the IBM z9 BC Mainframe, SANS array, SAN router, and Cisco equipment as key components of the Departments Enterprise Operations Center (EOC).  Equipment listed above is required for continued support/maintenance of the departments core business functions (payroll, retirement), based on compatibility with existing hardware, which has reached end-of-life and is no longer maintainable by the hardware vendor (IBM).  <BR><BR>Reposted to amend specs in line items 35 and 54.<BR><BR>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION/RELO INDUSTRY FORUM
Travel and Transportation Acquisition Support Division
General Services Administration
Employee Relocation Services
September 23, 2008


GENERAL INFORMATION

1.0	OBJECTIVE
On September 23, 2008, the General Services Administration (GSA) will host an industry information session to conduct market research to refine a proposed new guaranteed home sale services model.  The purpose of the information session is to solicit feedback from industry on the proposed model, stakeholder requirements, and other pertinent issues to assess viability of the model and its requirements.
   
2.0	PROBLEM STATEMENT
Federal civilian agencies relocate approximately 28,000 civilian employees annually.  Approximately 12,000 of these employees receive guaranteed home buyout assistance as a relocation benefit to expedite the sale of their home, maximize the sale price, and access the home’s equity. This is an important human capital benefit for recruitment and retention and, for some agencies, is a requirement to ensure personnel are mobile for mission-critical functions.  Historically, 85% of guaranteed home buyout services were procured via GSA’s Multiple Award Schedule, entitled Transportation, Delivery and Relocation Services Schedule (Schedule 48).
Under the terms of Schedule 48, Relocation Service Providers (RSPs) assume all burden and privilege of ownership of the relocating employee’s home if the home does not sell within a specified period.  For this service, RSPs charge fixed percentage rates based on the home’s sale price.
Recent downturns in the housing and lending markets have significantly affected suppliers’ ability to provide guaranteed home sale services to the Government under the Schedule because the model requires suppliers to bear all risks at fixed percentage rate pricing.  Under commercial models, RSPs offer services under cost-reimbursable contracts and transferees’ private-sector employers bear the risks of owning the homes.   
GSA has assessed models based on commercial standards and best practices to develop a new guaranteed home buyout model to supplement home buyout services currently offered under Schedule 48.  The objective of this new model is to task a service integrator with acquiring commercially priced guaranteed home buyout services that include full mortgage payoff that may be made available to the government at fixed percentage rate pricing.  GSA wishes to acquire this capability through one commercial source which has contracts with the necessary range of suppliers and services, to accomplish the vision as described in the draft statement of objectives. The DRAFT sow may be obtained by e-mailing your request to: transportation.programs@gsa.gov and onthego@gsa.gov using the subject line RELO INDUSTRY DAY.  

3.0	DISCUSSION OF INTEGRATE HOME SALES SERVICES INITIATIVE
Below are some the questions that GSA will address during the Industry Forum:

1. What is the vision of this guaranteed home sale contracting vehicle?

<DESC>PRESOLICITATION NOTICE

A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE WAS PREVIOUSLY POSTED ON MAY 16, 2008.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), Research and Development Contracts Management Branch (R&D CMB) (located within the NIDA Neuroscience COAC), using Full and Open Competition procedures, intends to solicit all eligible organizations capable of providing services under a contract entitled, “Scientific and Technical Support Services to the National Institutes of Health.”     

 The staffing services include: 

• Providing scientific research support in a wide variety of healthcare related areas. 
• Providing professional/executive support to the NIH research effort.
• Providing information technology support to the NIH research effort.
• Providing healthcare support to the NIH research and patient contact effort.
• Providing clinical research support to the NIH research.
• Providing industrial and facility maintenance support to the NIH research effort.

These tasks are classified as scientific/technical, professional/executive, health care, clinical research, or industrial/facility maintenance. The tasks may be either non-exempt (paid an hourly wage and required to receive payment for overtime hours), exempt (paid by salary/exempt from overtime) or Independent Contractors. The majority of all tasks will be performed in Bethesda or Rockville, Maryland, however, services are also needed at locations scattered throughout the United States.

Approximately 95% of all tasks are long-term for continuing performance in excess of six (6) months, however, there may be a need for intermittent tasks with flexible hours. The majority of the staffing services will be for full-time contract employees, however, there may be a need for part-time services and overtime. Part-time and overtime needs will be defined on the individual task order award documents.

This is not a new requirement. The current contractor is Kelly Services, Inc. which provides approximately 1000 Contractor Employees across NIH providing long-term support to twenty-four (24) of the twenty-seven (27) NIH Institutes and Centers (it is anticipated that need for services will increase further over time).

The tasks require a broad skill range across the entire spectrum of employment categories. The division of skill categories is subject to change but currently follows the approximate breakdown below:

Scientific - 47% 
Professional/Executive Admin - 31%
Information Technology - 7%
Healthcare - 6% 
Clinical Research - 5%
Industrial/Engineering - 1%

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 561320 and the size standard is $13.5M.  This acquisition is being procured under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15 - Negotiated Contracting.  It is envisioned that the contract will be awarded as a performance based contract.  A one (1) year base period, with four (4), one (1) year options is contemplated.  RFP #NIMH-09-OD-00001 is scheduled for electronic release on or about October 1, 2008 and the receipt date of proposals is scheduled on or about 45 days later.  The RFP may be accessed through http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the above internet site for the release of this solicitation and amendments, if any. 

Please note that the RFP for this requirement will include the Statement of Work, Deliverables, Performance Based Standards and Measures, Reporting Requirements, Technical Evaluation and Proposal Preparation instructions.  All information required for the submission of an offer will be contained in the electronic RFP package. Following proposal submission and the initial review process, offerors comprising the competitive range may be requested to provide additional documentation to the Contracting Officer.

All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a proposal that will be considered by the NIMH R&D CMB. This advertisement does not commit the Government to the award of a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. Please monitor the websites for release and further information. Please do not telephone asking for information regarding the actual release date.

AMENDMENT 0001
Purpose:  The Government is studying technological advancements that will provide improved Miniaturized Day/Night Sight-Sniper (MDNS-Sniper) fire control capability for Sniper weapons not covered by INOD nor existing Sniper day optics.
Technology Interests:  The MDNS Sniper program technology enhancement interests for sniper weapons include two items:  Precision Sniper Rifle (PSR) Optical Aiming Scope and an integrated Laser Range Finder and Visible Laser Module.  An IR Pointer/ IR Illuminator is a desired additional feature.  The technical attributes of interest for each of these items is described separately in Part one and Part two below. 
Part One.  Precision Sniper Rifle Optical Sight:  The PSR Optical Scope should be a precision, optical aiming scope with a variable magnification of approximately 6X to 24X.  Focus from 10m to infinity and selective reticle illumination capability.  The objective diameter must be a minimum of 50 mm.  Minimum eye relief of 4 inches and exit pupil should not exceed 10mm.  Windage and elevation turrets must be easily grasped, with adjustment increments of 0.250 MOA.  The windage and elevation adjusters should be provided with a means to provide the operator with tactile feedback with each click of the adjusters.  A cross hair reticle with MIL Dot ranging feature is of interest.  The X and Y dimensions of the reticle should not subtend a man sized target on maximum magnification at 1500m.  Reticle design is a user option, though a reticle which remains same size on minimum to maximum magnifications settings is desirable.  The PSR Optical scope should be capable of withstanding 5! 000 rounds of recoil shock from a 50 cal heavy sniper rifle without failure.  It should be waterproof to 66 ft for a period of 2 hours.  The size and weight should be minimized.  Weapon mounting methods must include compatibility with the 1913 rail mount configuration.  The mounting configuration should allow removal of the optic, remounting, and return to zero within 0.5 MOA after 500 rounds of 50 cal recoil.   
Part Two.  Laser Range Finder/ Visible Laser Module:  Technology solutions that include a Laser Range Finder (LRF) and visible laser pointer with one minute of angle windage and elevation adjustments are of interest.  It is desired that the wavelength chosen for the Laser Range Finder be undetectable by Generation 2 / 3 night vision devices.  An integrated visible laser to ensure collimation of range finder with telescopic sights and a target designator is required.  The system must have protected adjustment turrets for elevation and windage, with tactile adjustment values of one MOA per increment.  The LRF should have a remotely located LED digital readout visible to operator in firing position, providing the operator with range to target and re-ranging capability within three seconds.  Range of the LRF must be <10 m to 2500m> (in optimum atmospheric conditions) with ranging accuracy of +/-2.0 m.  Cone divergence of lasers must provide effective ranging on a one square mete! r target (with a reflectivity of 15%) to 1500 m.  Hard wire or wireless remote controls which can be fired from the pistol grip of the PSR with the firing hand are required.  Weapon mounting methods must include compatibility with the 1913 rail mount configuration and size which would allow potential internal mounting in the fore end of the PSR or mounting on top of scope mounting rings with a 1913 rail extension or foot.  Battery types must be of a standard commercially available type, such as AA or DL 123's.  Systems must be rugged and able to withstand repeated shock of up to 5000 rounds of.50 cal sniper rifle recoil.  System should employ methods to conserve battery power by entering a "sleep mode" after three minutes of non use. Waterproofing to a depth of 66 ft for two hours is desired.  A variable divergence IR illumination laser and IR aiming device is desired but not required, to enhance night capabilities of the system.  The IR device may be mounted on any 1913 ad! dress available on a not to interfere basis with optics or laser range finder.
Background:  The USSOCOM Special Operations Peculiar Modification (SOPMOD) program provides small arms accessories to Army, Navy, and Air Force Special Forces Operators.  In 1993, USSOCOM arranged with the Naval Sea Systems Command to establish the SOPMOD Program Management Office at the Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC), Crane Division, at Crane, Indiana.  Since then, the SOPMOD Program has provided joint Special Operations Forces (SOF) with standardized, versatile weapons accessories to meet all needs across SOF mission scenarios.  These accessories increase SOF survivability and lethality by providing enhanced weapon performance, signature suppression, target acquisition, and day and night precision aiming.  The SOPMOD program provides these accessories to SOF operators when the accessories are developed to the point that they are operationally suitable, affordable, sustainable, and funded.  SOPMOD is an evolutionary acquisition program that continues to change and to u! pgrade its subsystems with new combat technologies.  
Scope:  The MDNS-SNIPER Project will be conducted in two phases, immediate and long-term.  The immediate phase, Phase 1, will occur over the upcoming months to perform a technical assessment of existing technologies.  Both partial and fully integrated solutions will be evaluated.  The longer-term phase, Phase 2, will be conducted on a full and open competition basis and will require a fully integrated ensemble.  This announcement is expressly for Phase 1. 
Activity:  The SOPMOD MDNS-SNIPER Phase 1 project will utilize government personnel consisting of NSWC Crane and invited operators to conduct an assessment of vendor submitted subsystems on or about Nov or Dec 2008.  The government participants will mount, fire, and assess the various subsystems with regards to the current MDNS-SNIPER preliminary performance requirements and the operational tasks and missions outlined in applicable weapons field manuals and operator's manuals.  Each vendor's equipment will be evaluated separately and each vendor will be assigned a time for presentations, equipment training and the actual evaluation.  The vendors may be present during the evaluation of their equipment only to answer questions or to assist in the equipment operation.  Each participating vendor will be provided the technical assessment results of its equipment; otherwise, the results will be held by the Government to be proprietary to the vendor in accordance with FAR 3.104.  T! he longer term Phase two will be conducted on a full and open competition basis as a five year IDIQ program.  It is expected that Phase 2 will require offerors to submit two product samples, technical, past performance and price proposals.  Awards will be on a best value basis. 
Objective:  The Phase 1 technical assessment results and other information may be used to develop a Market Survey Report and a performance specification to support full and open competition for Phase 2 of the program.  The draft performance specification may be published on or about January or February of 2009. When it is published, interested parties will be asked to comment on the specification with a white paper response.  There is no intent to procure anything during phase 1.  To be eligible to participate in the Phase 1 technical assessment, contractors must be properly registered in the Government's Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  Offerors may obtain information on CCR registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet @ www.ccr.gov.
Invitation to Vendors:  Vendors wishing to participate in the Phase 1 activity will submit, not later than 30 Oct 2008:  A signed letter statement of intent to participate, to include a corporate certification that the devices intended for submission are certified safe for intended use.  For items containing lasers, submit evidence of technical tests proving that the lasers are emitting within the ranges specified by their respective laser classes.  Also include any other vendor-supplied technical test data, such as shock, environmental etc.  The letter of intent should clearly explain how the submitted samples improve the operational capabilities of the weapons of interest (see information requested below.)  
The government will review the technical information supplied by each vendor.  Vendors whose submissions include equipments that:  have no clearly explained or apparent value to increasing the operational capabilities of the weapon(s) of interest; or cannot be mounted or otherwise applied to the weapon of interest; or are not safe for intended use will not be invited to participate in the technical assessment.
The government will notify (in writing) selected participants of the date, times and location of the technical assessment as soon as this has been solidified. 
Information Requested:  For Phase 1 please submit a white paper by 30 Oct 2008 consisting of a technical description of the product, such as physical characteristics, operational features, performance data, photographs, and physical characteristics.  This submission may include commercial product literature, operating instructions, and manufacturer's information, such as Quick Reference Cards, Operators Manuals, and training materials, and/or supplemental technical documentation that define the item and associated hardware.  Request that potential sources address Fit, Function, SOF Environment (Rough Handling, cold etc), Accuracy, and Interoperability.  Potential sources should also provide any test results on the item and should certify that the product is safe for use for its intended purpose.  If any remaining developmental or production issues exist, sources should relate their organization's experience, understanding, and plan for resolving the issues.  Participating ve! ndors shall carefully mark their proprietary information in accordance with FAR 3.104.
Intellectual Property (IP):  Currently, the Government has no interest in the acquisition of vendor intellectual property.  Should this project result in a formal solicitation, the Government will clearly define its IP interests in the solicitation.  The Government wishes to maintain open system architectures, and will have very limited interest in items that restrict future spiral development by using proprietary interfaces.  
Participation:  This announcement is a public invitation.  Failure to participate in this Market Survey will not preclude abstaining vendors from bidding on possible future solicitations.  This announcement is part of the full-free-and-open competition process, which encourages industry and academia to help shape Government specifications to match what is possible, affordable, and timely.  Failure to participate in this open Market Survey process may result in a future Government performance specification over which the abstaining vendors have limited influence in the acquisition process, and may deprive abstaining vendors of potentially valuable direct early interaction with end-users, contracting officials, and acquisition planners.  Participating vendors will be provided access to redacted excerpts of the Market Survey Report, covering selected portions of the report limited to only the individual vendor's samples. 
Other Notes:  It should be noted that during the course of this acquisition program, the Government plans to utilize employees from Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), Wexford Group International (WGI), EG&G, Weapons System Technology Integration Center (WSTIAC), Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) and other direct Government contractors as advisors to the Government participants.  
Comments:  Questions should be directed to Stacy McAtee, contracting officer, Code 0562NS, telephone 812-854-1988, fax 812-854-5095.  Email stacy.mcatee@navy.mil.  Complete mailing address is Code 0562NS, Bldg 3422, NSWC Crane, 300 Highway 361, Crane Indiana 47522-5001.  Please reference the above solicitation number when responding to this notice.  While the Government may use Market Survey information provided to conduct small purchases for testing, combat user assessments, and specification/solicitation preparation, this sources sought synopsis does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the Government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  The U.S. Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement.  Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to t! his announcement or incurred for participation in the Market Survey will NOT be reimbursed.  All information marked as proprietary information will be safeguarded to prevent disclosures to non-Government personnel and entities.  Your interest in this response is appreciated.

Statement of Work for Statistical Technical SupportLower Duwamish Waterway Superfund Site
Solicitation number RFQ-WA-08-00016 is applicabable and is issued as a Reqeust for Quotation. 
This is a combined snynopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This solicitation is a Request for Quotations and NOT a Request for Proposals or an Invitation for Bid. Provision 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.  

PURPOSE - The purpose of this request for quotation is to support the Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) at the Lower Duwamish Waterway Superfund site in Seattle, Washington.  The contractor shall help develop new statistical methods for deriving cleanup levels using 95% Upper Confidence Levels (UCLs) that take into account how data associated with sampling locations are spatially distributed, for example, as derived from Inverse Distance Weighting algorithms. The contractor shall assist EPA in providing direction to Potentially Respsonsible Party (PRP_ consultants in deriving these UCLs and creating simulations to test the validity of the UCLs. The contractor shall review and provide recommendations on work products created by PRPs. 
BACKGROUND - The Lower Duwamish Waterway is a 5.5 mile portion of the Lower Duwamish River which flows into the Elliott Bay in Seattle, Washington.  EPA added about five miles of the waterway to its list of Superfund cleanup sites in 2001.  The contaminants in the waterway sediments include polycholorinated biphenyls (PCBs), plycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), arsenic and other metals, and dioxins/furans.  Four potentially responsible parties (PRPs) are conducting a Remedial/Investigation Feasibility Study (RI/FS) under a 2000 Administrative Order on Consent with EPA and the Washington Department of Ecology.  The PRP group, known as the Lower Duwamish Waterway Group (LDWG), completed a draft RI Report in November 2007.  They are currently revising the draft RI Report and ware working with EPA and Ecology in a series  of meetings and informal deliverables to define the scope of the FS. The PRPs have proposed use of 95% UCLs on spatially weighted averages as a means to address spatial bias in sampling in developing areas of potential concern to address cleanup goals developed as part of the human health and ecological risk assessments.  The PRPs and their consultants have an interest in developing new statistical methods for deriving UCLs that take into account spatial bias, but lack the necessary expertise.  Cleanup goals include both risk-based and background values. 
TASK 1:  STATISTICAL TECHNICAL SUPPORT
Expertised Required:  The contractor shall have at least two years of experience in various approaches for computing spatially weighted 95% upper confidence limts (UCLs) that are based on Thiessen polygon or inverse distance weighting algorithms, conducting simulations to verify methods for computing spatially weighted 95% UCLs, and applying thse approaches in the context of Superfund risk assessment and/or feasibility study.  The contractor shall provide resume(s) of qualified staff showing at least two years of relevant experience, along with examples of statistical analyses completed in the last three years showing examples of simulations that demonstrate the validity of methods applied to specific Supefund sites. 
The contractors shall assist EPA in providing their expert opinion and guidance to PRPs on the development and use of methods for computing 95% upper UCLs for specific Lower Duwamish Waterway (LDW) contaminant concentrations that consider the spatial distribution of contaminant concentrations.  Method recommendations will consider the probability distribution of contaminant concentrations, the autocorrelations of contaminant concentration in two dimensional space, the area/exposure unit of concern,  the sampling design utilized to determine post-remediation compliance, and the degrees of freedom assocated with post-remediation compliance monitoring sampling. The contractor shall provide expert opinion on development and application of simulation testing to verify that the method(s) selected provide true 95% UCLs, and on the development of approaches for comparing spatially weighted 95% UCL concentration values to cleanup levels that may be based on risk or background considerations. In addition, the contractor shall review and make recommendations on PRP deliverables showing calculations of spatially weighted 95% UCLs and simulations showing the validity of these values.
Technical review and recommendations will be provided in the form of participation in telephone conferences and written recommendations on PRP deliverables.
For pricing purposes, the job will include a total of 120 hours of participation in ten (10) telephone conferences, and review and provide written recommendations on three (3) submitted PRP documents, includig selected sections of the draft Feasibility Study, whiche is due to EPA in March 2009. No travel is anticipated. 
TASK 2: PROJECT SUBMITTALS
Submittals will consist of brief written recommendations on PRP deliverables as well as invoices and Monthly Progress Reports which should be submitted monthly for the months when costs were expended. 
Period of Performance: September 29, 2008 - September 30, 2009.  Although the exact schedule of this work is not known, we anticipate that work in Summer and Fall 2008 will consist of providing recommendatinos to EPA and the PRPs, then in Spring and Summer 2009, the contractor will be asked to review and provide reocmmendations on PRP work products. 
The selection resulting from this request for quotation will be made on the basis of lowest price technically acceptable and award will be made by unilateral Purchase Order, issued using Optional Form 347.   
Quotes must include the following:1) Price quote 2) Resume(s) of qualified staff showing at least two years of relevant experience3) Examples of statistical analyses completed in the last three years showing simulations that demonstrate the validity of methods applied to specific Superfund sites. 
Any quotes received that do not include the proper submittals will be deemed non-responsive.
All quotes must include a Dunn and Bradstreet Number and Tax ID Number.  In addition, all  quoters must be actively registered in teh Central Contractors Registration database at www.ccr.gov. 

Telephone inquiries will NOT be accepted. 
Quotes MUST be emailed, mailed or faxed and are due on or before the RFQ close date/Response Date and time. No late submissions will be considered for any reason.

<p class="MsoNormal">In response to Hurricane Gustav, FEMA Declared Disaster

Federal transportation assets to various National Disaster Medical System
(NDMS) Federal Coordinating Centers (FCCs) in Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) Regions IV and VI (Atlanta, Birmingham, Dallas, Houston,
Jacksonville, Little Rock, Miami, Nashville, Oklahoma City, Lexington,
Louisville, San Antonio, and Tampa).&nbsp; FCCs are responsible for placing
evacuated patients in hospitals in the metropolitan areas proximate to the
FCCs.&nbsp; In a few instances, evacuees may have been transported directly to
nursing homes, special needs shelters and/or other healthcare facilities or
have since transferred to similar facilities from a hospital.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), in its
role as Primary Agency for Emergency Support Function (ESF) #8 of the National
Response Framework must execute the return of all evacuees that require
en-route medical care and therefore cannot travel via commercial air or without
medical assistance.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
