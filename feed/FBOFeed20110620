<p>Solicitation Number: FA4600-11-R-0028</p>
<p>APPROXIMATE SOLICITATION ISSUE DATE: June 2011. The 55th Contracting Squadron will be conducting the solicitation and award of a full and open competition, non-personal services, cost plus incentive fee contract for a base period and six (6) one year option periods. In addition, FAR clause 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services will be included. This effort is to provide Air Vehicle Planning System capabilities for USSTRATCOM. Contract Transition period is expected to be 180 days starting approximately between 1 August 2012 and 31 January 2013. The Air Vehicle Planning System (APS) software is a full fidelity (able to plan fully validated missions down to the individual sortie level) force-level mission planning system that performs planning functions in support of the nation's nuclear war plan and Conventional Air Launched Cruise Missile (CALCM). APS is currently used to plan missions involving the following aircraft and weapon systems: B-52, B-2, KC-135, KC-10, RC-135, U-2, EP-3, Air Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM), Advanced Cruise Missile (ACM), and CALCM. APS also contains capability to plan DCA, F15/16/18, but this functionality is not in current use. The APS application is used to perform Air Vehicle planning operations, including maintenance operations, exercise and adaptive planning for the Operational Plan (OPLAN), non-nuclear OPLAN planning, and non-nuclear planning. Tasks include route Generation, Mating and Ranging, Timing, Verification, Data Products and Tape Build. Results and outputs are also used by other applications. The software is also used to perform maintenance operations, as required, for an existing OPLAN. The APS mission planning software requirement includes: on-site support for USSTRATCOM planners; engineering and software services for maintenance and analysis of Government-owned mission planning software; provision of interoperability with other necessary programs; correction of known software deficiencies; incorporation of guidance changes; maintenance of the capability to fix both non-critical and emergency (critical) Software Change Requests (SCRs); and application training of USSTRATCOM personnel. The requirement also includes provisions for enhancements and code development. <br /><br />Contractor must be able to meet all requirements of the Performance Work Statement (PWS), certification requirements, and appropriate security clearances. This project is classified up to Top Secret. Individuals may require access to Nuclear Command and Control-Extremely Sensitive Information (NC2-ESI), Special Compartmentalized Information (SCI), Special Acess Program (SAP), and Alternate Compensatory Control Measures (ACCM). An interim Top Secret clearance does not satify DD254 requirements. Contractor must comply with guidelines specified in the DD Form 254, Contract Security Classification Specification (draft DD Form 254 to be issued with the draft RFP). This acquisition will be conducted using negotiated procedures in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Request For Proposal (RFP) and all associated documents, when issued, will be posted on the required government wide point of entry. A draft solicitation is available at this time. Offerors are encouraged to subscribe/register for this solicitation number through http://www.fedbizopps.gov to ensure they automatically receive all documents associated with the procurement in a timely manner. All associated documents will be released electronically, except for the Technical Library CD, which will be provided at the Preproposal Conference/Site Visit (see Section L1.12 of the draft RFP). The NAICS code is 541511, and the size standard is $25M. Anticipated award date is summer 2012. Address questions via-mail to the contracting officer or contract specialist only. No discussions will be conducted telephonically.</p>

<p>SOLICITATION NUMBER: FA8601-11-R-0109<br />This effort includes three projects (one base CLIN with 2 Options) to be performed at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH: 1) Project Number ZHTV09003415 to Reconfigure Chilled Water includes upgrades to the chilled water distribution system throughout the National Air and Space Intelligence Center Complex, including but not limited to replacing pumps, valves, controls, piping and an enclosure on the roof of Building 829 to house the 20" header, air separator and expansion tanks; 2) Project Number ZHTV110025 (Option I) Install Chiller Number 5 in Building 829 including a new cooling tower, condensing and chilled water piping, valves, direct digital controls, and pump; and 3) Project Number ZHTV110026 (Option II) Replace 3, 60 ton chillers in the penthouse in Building 828, including 3 new pumps, associated piping, valves, and direct digital controls.</p>
<p>Special Requirements/Concerns: This project impacts an absolutely critical AF mission in support of war fighters. The schedule must be closely coordinated as intelligence production and analyses will be impaired by any disruption due to lack of cooling, heating, and ventilation in this essentially windowless facility. This project requires a contractor familiar with working in a secure building. NASIC requires that contractors are U.S. citizens. The contractor should have flexibility with their work plan and be able to forecast their work. A 48-hour notice is required for access. An escort is required for all work in the NASIC Complex. The contractor will need proper manpower in all relevant disciplines to work continuously in one work area and finish the work before moving on to the next area. Furthermore, in order to reduce the impact to NASIC's mission, only part of the work area will be vacated at a time.

<DESC><strong>Date</strong>; June 17, 2011<br /><br /><strong>Subject</strong>: Solicitation Number APP111513, Hospital Engagement Contractor in Support of Partnership for Patients.<br /><br />CMS intends to award&nbsp;multiple contracts&nbsp;for the subject need by September 30, 2011.&nbsp; CMS intends to make Firm Fixed Price awards however the contracting officer reserves the right to award any other type of contract type deemed necessary.<br /><br />Please be advised that this Pre-Solicitation does not commit the Government to pay any cost for the preparation and submission of a quotation.&nbsp; In addition the contracting officer is the only individual who can legally commit the Government to the expenditure of public finds in connection with this procurement.&nbsp; CMS anticipates making awards without discussions.<br /><br /><strong>CMS Industry Day</strong>:<br /><br />CMS has planned an Industry Day related to this effort.&nbsp; Please pay close attention to the following information;<br /><br /><strong>Website</strong>: <a href="https://webinar.cms.hhs.gov/pfp-engagement/">https://webinar.cms.hhs.gov/pfp-engagement/</a> <br /><strong>Telephone number</strong>: (877)-267-1577<br /><strong>Participant Code</strong>: 5045<br /><br /><strong>Date</strong>: July 6, 2011<br /><strong>Time</strong>: 1:00pm - 4:00pm EST<br /><br />Because we are limited to 200 lines, access will be restricted to one audio line and one webinar line per organization.&nbsp; If the participants want to make arrangements, when logging in to the webinar site as a guest , identify the organization and primary representative speaking on behalf of the organization.&nbsp; (i.e. Maryland Safe Hospitals Assoc - John Doe).<br /><br /><strong>Please be advised</strong>: CMS does not expect any organizations to be present at CMS headquarters for this Industry Day.<br /><br /><strong>Background</strong>:<br /><br />The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) will implement the Partnership for Patients (PFP). The PFP is a priority project designed to reduce inpatient harm by 40% and readmissions by 20% over a 3 year period. The PFP has identified ten areas of focus. Although the PFP will not limit its work to these areas and will pursue the reduction of all-cause harm, these focus areas are those for which content will be developed and learning activities conducted and made available to hospitals participating in the partnership. The Hospital Engagement Contractor (HEC) may address additional forms of harm and complications beyond this core set. <br />&bull; Adverse drug events (ADE)<br />&bull; Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI)<br />&bull; Central line-associated blood stream infections (CLABSI)<br />&bull; Injuries from falls and immobility<br />&bull; Obstetrical adverse events<br />&bull; Pressure ulcers<br />&bull; Surgical site infections<br />&bull; Venous thromboembolism (VTE)<br />&bull; Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)<br />&bull; Preventable readmissions<br /><br />Through coordinated efforts with industry and experts in the field of medicine, CMS has an interest in testing models such as large improvement networks aimed at rapidly studying, and identifying alternative methodologies and care models for bringing about rapid change and improvements in patient care. In support of the PFP, CMS will engage the hospital, provider and broader care-giver communities to quickly implement well-tested and measured best practices; the end result of the overall initiative is the anticipated reduction in hospital-based harm and preventable readmissions for our beneficiary population. Provided in Section J, Attachment 1 is a document outlining the overall goals of the PFP and the expected impact on the Medicare and Medicaid populations as well as the exponential impact on the broader population. Further information on other work in the PFP arena and other contracts in support of PFP may be found at J, Attachment 2.
<p><strong>Purpose</strong>:<br /><br />Under the terms and conditions of this contract, the HECs will design and conduct various types of training events and sessions for hospitals. The training should be rooted in establishing and measuring/evaluating ongoing improvement projects in each participating hospital (or facility). All education activities are designed to achieve reductions in the ten core events and producing measurable improvements in quality measures associated with the ten core events. The success of the HEC will, in large part, be assessed through objective measurement of the incidence of the ten core events. The HECs will be required to coordinate their efforts with government and other contractor personnel involved in the PFP while performing tasks of this contract as defined in the requirements below. In order to successfully perform this contract, the HECs must host various training sessions for hospitals engaged in ongoing improvement projects. While it is anticipated that the HECs will engage in methods such as webinars, meetings and conferences to accomplish the work as defined in this contract, it must be noted that this is a performance-based contract; the expectation is that the contractors will specify in detail the methods they plan to use to meet the requirements as established by the Government.&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>Synopsis
<p>Evaluation and Guidance Development for Post-Grouted Drilled Shafts for Highways</p>
<p>This is a Pre-Solicitation notice (synopsis) for a full and open competition. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has a requirement to conduct a study to provide a critical and objective evaluation of current design and construction practices for post-grouting drilled shafts (also known as tip-grouting, or pre-stressing or preloading drilled shafts via fluid grout) for highway projects.</p>
<p>Alternative construction proposals are increasingly being submitted to highway agencies for post-grouting of drilled shafts. These alternatives are being proposed as a means to:<br />1. increase end-bearing capacity, thereby allowing drilled-shaft lengths to be shortened; <br />2. verify capacity as a function of the maximum grout-pressure; <br />3. stiffen the load-deformation response for working stresses; and <br />4. minimize the effects of soft-bottom conditions.</p>
<p>This study is necessary to provide a basis upon which nationwide guidance for post-grouted drilled shafts for highway design and construction will be developed and provided. The primary objectives of this study are to:<br />1. Bound the application of this technology for the current state of knowledge.<br />2. Quantify the improvement mechanism(s) for post-grouting.<br />3. Develop design methodology(ies) for appropriate applications.<br />4. Provide method(s) for verification.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this requirement is 541330. The RFP will be released and available electronically at http://www.fedbizopps.gov. Interested parties may register at the aforementioned site to receive a variety of procurement announcements/notifications. It is the responsibility of interested parties to monitor the FedBizOpps website for any amendments to the RFP package. NO OTHER PROCUREMENT INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.</p>

The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division intends to enter into an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) with Northrop Grumman, 44 Castilian Drive, Goleta, California 93117.  The IDIQ will cover a five year period with a minimum of one and maximum of five to procure Multi-Domain Electronic Warfare Test and Evaluation System (METES).
  The non-commercial solicitation will be issued using other than full and open competition to Northrop Grumman IAW FAR 6.302 and statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  The basis for restricting competition is the proprietary nature of the technical data for the system resulting in a lack of drawings and specifications, in addition to duplicative costs and time that would be required to reverse engineer the system.  
The proposed IDIQ is for a METES system or systems for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, Northrop Grumman, under authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  The basis for restricting competition is the proprietary information of Northrop Grumman, form, fit, and function compatibility and the duplicative cost to the Government to utilize another source to satisfy the Governmentâs requirements.
This requirement was previously posted under #N00164-11-R-WR47 on 16 MAR 2011 and was amended to reflect the correct Solicitation number N00164-11-R-WM47.

<DESC>The justification is as follows.  The coal service subscriptions are needed in order to assess whether and how to update the coal supply curves used by EPA in the Integrated Planning Model of the U.S. power sector. Those supply curves, were developed for EPA in 2009 by Wood Mackenzie. EPA requires the three Wood Mackenzie coal service subscriptions because they use the same underlying approach employed in the development of EPA's coal supply curves. No other coal projection would provide the required consistency in approach.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order under Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Waters Corporation, 34 Maple Street, Milford, MA 01757 for the repair of a Waters Autospec high resolution GC/Mass Spectrometer. The repair is required to bring instrument to proper working condition so that drinking water and other research samples can be analyzed. The magnet slave unit is not functioning properly and needs to be replaced. Waters does not allow customers to order and replace this particular magnet slave unit. Waters engineers have the experience needed to repair the instrument. Only Waters has access to instrument board and other parts needed and does not allow third party companies to install. EPA has identified Waters Corporation, the only vendor capable of satisfy the requirement. The circumstance permitting is FAR 6.301-1, ?only one responsible source?. The intent of this notice is to determine if any other sou rce(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available. Consequently, any response failing to provide the aforementioned data and instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will be ignored. The information received in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  Interested parties who can meet the above requirements may submit written qualification statements, fully explaining their capability no later than 10 days after the date of this publication. Submit response to the U.S. EPA, Attn: Pamela E. Smith (MC-E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711, by fax (919) E685-3178 or by e-mail at smith.pamela@epa.gov . No telephone request will not be honored.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition

1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 12, Great Lakes Acquisition Center, 5000 W. National Avenue, Milwaukee, WI 53295.

2.    Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  	Justification and approval for Other Than Full and Open Competition for the purchase of five (5) Conmed Beamer Mates with all accessories, for the Edward Hines VA Hospital in Hines, IL per Purchase Request# 578-11-3-969-0139.  Award of a new firm-fixed price contract is anticipated.  This procurement will proceed on a sole source basis with Conmed Corporation.				
3.    Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:   The Edward Hines VA Hospital has a requirement for five (5) Conmed Beamer Mates with all accessories, along with add-on equipment.  The total  procurement cost is $180,475.  Delivery is expected within 90 days of the Notice of Award.

4.    Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  FAR 6.302-1(a)(2).  The VA's minimum needs can only be satisfied by unique supplies or services available from only one source (41 USC 253 (c)(1)).

5.    Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   The following unique features are incorporated into the ConMed Beamer:  
		-Is a GI Specific platform
-Has a ceramic tip Argon probe, which reduces eschar from sticking to the tip of the probe, thus reducing procedure time
-Audio/Visual patient electrode monitoring
-Argon Beam Snare Probe is a proprietary device which has the ability to resect tissue and apply Argon with a single device which will minimize exchanges, therefore reducing procedure time and improving patient outcomes.
-Low Argon Flow Rate reduces risk of gas embolism 
-Bicap Sense Stop Technology is a safety feature that measures tissue impedence,  which gives the physician the ability to predetermine the level of hemostasis they wish to achieve, and the unit stops once predetermined threshold is met. 

6.    Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:    Other vendor's products were evaluated but did not have all the required features. 

7.    Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:   There are no prior awards for this on FBO and Conmed owns the patent for the new technology. The requesting medical facility personnel who are experts in their field feel this is an appropriate amount for the needed equipment. I concur with my medical staff.

8.    Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  There is no comparable product on the market that I could find. 
	
9.    Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  Nothing on GSA, VA NAC, VETBIZ, SBA.

10.  Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  None.

11.  A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  None.

<DESC>Temporary parking construction is intended to serve as temporary parking serving displaced parking associated with the permanent Parking Structure project construction.  Temporary parking install is formulated to provide surface parking withstanding snow removal and general use through the life of the permanent Parking Structure project construction which is expected to last approximately 18 months.

The temporary parking construction is grouped into three main phases as follows.  

Phase I:   

Build temporary parking on a current grass / gravel area around Building 8  using recycled construction material.  All construction material on all lots delineated below is to be provided by the contractor.  The temporary construction around Building 8 will recover approximately 48 spaces.  Contractor is responsible for the cut and cap of lawn sprinkler lines at area designated near Building 8 .  No handicap provisions or signage for this particular lot will be required under this contract.  Tree shown on detail is to remain in place and be protected per last paragraph in this Scope of Work document.

Phase 1 temporary parking will be completed in fifteen work days within notice to proceed of this work.

Phase II:  

Phase II will consist of expanding the parking lot at Building 14 (referred to as 'Lot 14') by approximately 45 additional parking stalls.  This phase will require restriping .  In addition, in order to construct the stalls shown on south end of Lot 14, this will require removal and stock piling of existing rock beds and replacement of these rocks with recycled construction material (asphalt and concrete over non woven geotecstial fabric).  There is an existing electronic parking gate in Lot 14 that contractor is to remove (gate, pedestal, and electrical wiring) for delivery to the VA; components are to be kept in a reusable condition.  This, along with restriping and reconfiguring the existing space, will allow for approximately 60 handicap patient stalls and approximately 236 patient stalls.  Handicap stalls are to meet current ADA requirements and be painted as shown on detail.  Non-handicap stalls are to be 9' x 20'.  No signage will be required under this contract. Barricades will not be required under this contract.  Existing striping that differs from Lot 14 layout is to be painted over.


Phase II temporary parking will be completed in twenty work days within notice to proceed of this work.


Phase III:  

This phase is to construct and stripe temporary parking along the east and south sides of the future Valor House area, utilizing the VA property up to the property line that adjoins Sunnyside Park per detail A-3.  This construction is to be consistent with paving detail.  Approx. 6500 Cubic Yard of compacted material below fabric is required in order for elevations to work with the new Valor House and the existing roadways.  In addition, a 38 space temporary parking space will be constructed to the west of Building 38 per detail A-4.   This parking area by Building 38 will require saw cut of new approach   

Phase III temporary parking will be completed in forty work days within notice to proceed of this work.

<SUBJECT>C-5 Antiskid System Improvement Redesign
<SOLNBR>FA8251-11-C5-ASSIRD
<RESPDATE>070111
<CONTACT>Shauna A. H. Lyon, Contract Negotiator, Phone 8017753801, Email shauna.lyon@hill.af.mil
<DESC>1.PURPOSE: The USAF will be moving forward with a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a new C-5 Antiskid Control Unit (ACU) that requires updated cost and schedule information applicable to the latest project technical requirements based on this RFI. As a result of the feasibility study phase of the C-5 Antiskid System Improvement project the Air Force has determined that an improved ACU will resolve the system deficiencies identified in the original RFI. RFP preparations for the improved C-5 ACU are in process and will be posted to FBO at a later date. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or pay for the information provided by this RFI. General Atomics Systems Integration (GA-SI) has been contracted to assist the Air Force in implementation of the improved ACU.
<p>2.BACKGROUND: The Air Force conducted and concluded a feasibility study evaluating options to upgrade the C-5 antiskid system in September 2010. During this study a request for information (RFI) was sent to industry through the Federal Business Opportunities website (fbo.gov / solicitation #FA8251-10-C5-ASUF). Based on results of this study, the Air Force has decided to pursue an upgrade to the Antiskid Control Unit (ACU) that will be a form-fit-function replacement. The United States Air Force (USAF) C-5 Galaxy heavy cargo transport aircraft, built by Lockheed, entered operational service in 1970 and has a projected service life beyond 2040. The C-5 fleet consists of four models of aircraft (59) C-5A's, (46) C-5B's, (2) C-5C's and (4) C-5M's. The estimated fleet size for the improved ACU is 89 aircraft plus 34 spares for a total of 123 units.</p>
<p>3.IMPROVED C-5 ANTISKID CONTROL UNIT REQUIREMENTS SUMMARY<br />a.Controller Design &amp; Architecture - The improved ACU shall be a digital controller consisting of twelve (12) control channels. All 12 channels shall be powered from either one of dual redundant 28 Vdc power supplies. Each channel shall control a single antiskid servo valve dedicated to a pair of brakes on one of the four MLG providing paired wheel antiskid functionality. Each MLG has six wheels. Each of these channels shall incorporate wheel speed input and processing for two wheels, processing for skid control, fault detection, ancillary inputs, a single output valve driver, and interchannel communication. Each of the 12 control channels shall reside on a dedicated circuit card module which can be individually replaced. The ACU shall include Built-In-Test (BIT) circuitry for fault detection and fault display functions and flight deck antiskid fault light operation. The ACU is powered when the aircraft is powered and the flight deck Antiskid switch is in the ON position, including while in flight.<br />b.ACU Envelope and Installation - The upgraded ACU shall be installed in the same location as the legacy controller using the same mounting hardware. ACU dimensions may be reduced as long as the unit is compatible with the mounting location. ACU weight shall not exceed the legacy ACU weight of 14.8 lb.<br />c.Electrical Power - The ACU shall be compatible with the power quality requirements of the original MIL-STD-704. The ACU shall continue to function normally through power interruptions of 40 msec.<br />d.Antiskid Features - The ACU shall interface with the hydromechanical brake system of the C-5, detect incipient skid of the MLG tires, and modulate the full range of brake pressure (70 - 2,100 psi) to prevent loss of braking effectiveness, loss of air vehicle directional control, or damage to the air vehicle due to skidding resulting from braking operations. Improved ACU dry pavement antiskid performance shall be equivalent or better than the existing C-5 system, wet pavement antiskid efficiency shall improve by 15%. The antiskid functionality shall include touchdown protection and spinup override, locked wheel protection, and hydroplane protection features. Antiskid performance requirements shall be met using the current 50 tooth wheel speed sensor / exciter ring detector, the improved 50 tooth wheel speed transducer (electrically equivalent to the detector) and antiskid servo valves (0 to 40 mA).<br />e.Brake Life Improvement - The upgraded ACU shall incorporate a control scheme that provides at least a 20% improvement in brake life over the current 1,000 landing baseline. The brake life improvement feature shall not degrade landing, refused takeoff (RTO), or max pedal braking performance. Also, it shall not result in a dragging brake or cause undesired residual brake heating. Brake life improvement targets as well as antiskid performance targets shall be met with both legacy and new versions of carbon brakes (Goodrich p/n 260-385 and 2-1702).<br />f.Built In Test - The ACU shall incorporate improved BIT capability to detect system faults, isolate them to the appropriate Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) and display the fault information. BIT shall consist of both Continuous BIT and Initiated BIT.<br />Continuous BIT monitors 28 Vdc power (2), Wheel Speed Transducers (24), Antiskid Servo Valves (12), Pressure Switches (12), WOW (4) and ACU circuitry for failures.<br />Initiated BIT (Flight Deck Test Switch 1) applies 28 Vdc power to only one of the 2 ACU power supplies and applies aircraft 400 Hz aircraft power (simulated wheel speed) to half of the 24 wheel speed ACU inputs causing locked wheel brake release on all 24 brakes and illumination of the flight deck "Brakes On" light (driven by the ACU using the 12 pressure switch inputs).</p>
<p>Initiated BIT (Flight Deck Test Switch 2) applies 28 Vdc power to other ACU power supply and applies aircraft 400 Hz aircraft power (simulated wheel speed) to the other half of the 24 wheel speed ACU inputs causing locked wheel brake release on all 24 brakes and illumination of the flight deck "Brakes On" light (driven by the ACU using the 12 pressure switch inputs).<br />g.Software - The ACU software shall be developed, implemented, tested, and documented according to the requirements of DO-178B level D.<br />h.Environmental Requirements - The ACU shall meet typical environmental requirements for an aerospace controller of this type. These requirements include ambient temperature, altitude, humidity, salt fog, sand &amp; dust, vibration, acceleration, shock, explosive atmosphere, EMI, and ESD. EMI testing shall include the following portions of MIL-STD-461D: CE102, CS101, CS114, CS115, CS116, RE102, and RS103.<br />i.Life / Reliability - The ACU shall have an operating life of at least 120,000 skid control cycles plus a shelf life of 5 years. The ACU shall achieve a minimum of 2,000 landing mean cycles between failures (MCBF).<br />j.Testing - The required ACU tests and other verification methods for the ACU are listed in the table below. GA-SI will conduct the hardware in the loop (HITL) system verification tests. The supplier will have to develop and utilize a load source box for many of the functional tests listed.<br />Verification Dev / Qual Units Production Units<br /><br />Inspections (sec 4.2) <br />First Article Inspections All <br />Production Inspections All<br />Demonstrations (sec 4.3) <br />Reliability 2 minimum <br />Remove / Replace ACU Unit a <br />Service &amp; Access Unit a <br />Functional Troubleshooting Test Unit a <br />Remove / Replace Circuit Card Module Unit a <br />Safety Unit a <br />Transportability Unit a <br />Weight Measurement 2, Units a &amp; b <br />Acceptance Testing (sec 4.4) <br />Insulation Resistance All All<br />Environmental Stress Screening (ESS) All All<br />Functional Acceptance Testing All All<br />Qualification Testing (sec 4.5, 4.6, 4.7) <br />Electrical Unit a <br />Endurance Unit a <br />Temperature Unit a <br />Altitude Unit b <br />Humidity Unit b <br />Salt Fog Unit b <br />Sand &amp; Dust Unit a <br />Vibration Unit a <br />Acceleration Unit b <br />Shock Unit b <br />Explosive Atmosphere Unit b <br />Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) Unit b <br />Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) Unit a <br />HITL Skid Control Performance Unit c <br />HITL Skid Control Functions Unit c <br />HITL Fault Indication Unit c <br />k.USAF Depot Maintenance - The supplier shall provide a prototype ACU tester for Depot repair and associated technical data.</p>

<p><strong>2. Background/Scope</strong></p>
<p>The United States Air Force (AF) Air Mobility Command's (AMC) priority is to develop a comprehensive fitness model with a component designed to increase proactive coping, self-management and leadership skills to enhance individual resilience. Cultivating these skills in our Airmen will ensure that AMC maintain a cadre of balanced, healthy, self-confident Airmen whose physical, mental, spiritual and social fitness and resiliency enable them to effectively manage, and even experience personal and professional growth in response to stressors associated with military service, including a high operational tempo, deployments, recurrent change and the requirement to maintain high personal and professional standards of conduct. Military members face all of these challenges in addition to family, home and community responsibilities and stressors, which may be exacerbated by the rigors of military life. The current effort is intended to support and train individual Airmen in small groups to increase resilience across Air Mobility Command. Goals include:</p>
<p>- Supporting positive coping with challenge and adversity<br />- Reducing negative outcomes <br />- Accomplishing the Air Force global mission</p>
<p>AMC is seeking a program that could train Airmen in skills, attitudes and behaviors to promote individual resilience in conjunction with leadership skills to increase organizational resilience is the objective. Specifically, AMC would like targeted intensive, skills based, small group, experiential resilience training for Airmen, supervisors, middle managers, senior leaders and spouses to be provided by full time professional Resilience Trainers at our 12 AMC installations. The goal is to train 100% of our active duty and DOD civilian employees and a substantial proportion of military spouses. The intervention should be a state of the art, evidence based multimodal educational experience that can be customized to the needs of our target population, manualized for standardized implementation and deployed to Air Force bases within months. Outcomes related to current negative outcomes would be targeted, including: suicide events, alcohol related misconduct, disciplinary actions and family maltreatment. Standardized measures of resilience and related constructs would be employed to assess change in self-reported attitudes, skills and behaviors. Qualitative reports/personal accounts and participant satisfaction surveys would also be employed in assessing the overall value of the program</p>

Circular Dichroism Spectrometer - 1 ea<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Statement of&nbsp;Work&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />In this project, we propose to intensively characterize using methods beyond those typically employed at lot release. For this purpose, we will use a model protein, protamine sulfate, from various sources. It is the only drug approved by FDA to reverse the anticoagulant effects of heparins. Protamine, isolated from sperm nuclei of fish, is a complex mixture of several similar peptides which are rich in arginine and positively charged. It is administered by IV routes. It has been suggested that the biological activities of protamines are primarily based upon the ability of these positively charged peptides present in the protamine to bind to other negatively charged biomolecules (e.g., polysaccharides). Structural attributes of protamine, such as molecular weight distribution, charge density, secondary structure, can have a significant impact on it binding to polysaccharides, and thus affect the safety and efficacy of the final drug product. These attributes have not been characterized extensively in any previously approved protamine sulfate injection products.</p>
<p>Secondary and higher order structures of monoclonal antibodies and therapeutic proteins will be determined using Circular Dichroism which will aid in complete characterization of proteins and therefore, DPQR wishes to purchase this equipment.<br /><br />This collaborative project between Office of Testing and Research, Office of Biotech Products and Office of Generic Drugs will be able to delineate some of the critical quality attributes (CQAs) which are important for safety and efficacy. A comprehensive characterization will help build a regulatory framework for the incoming biosimilars which will enable reviewers to look proactively into characterizing similar molecules.<br /><br />Interested small business potential offerors are encouraged to respond to this notice.

This Notice of Partnering Opportunity (NPO)seeks potential partners to participate in a proposal development activity that addressesthe scientific instruments and orbital spacecraft on an EV-2 mission proposal.	Theofferor(s) chosen will participate directly as a member of the proposal team in thevarious stages of the mission design and proposal process.SECTION 1  INTRODUCTIONGENERAL INFORMATIONEarth Venture (EV) class  missions consist of a series of uncoupled, relativelylow-to-moderate cost, small to medium-sized, full orbital and sub-orbital missions, andinstruments which are regularly solicited and competitively selected Earth Scienceinvestigations as recommended by the recent National Research Councils decadal survey inEarth science, Earth Science and Applications from Space: National Imperatives for theNext Decade and Beyond (The National Academies Press, 2007, available athttp://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=11820).  Earth Venture -2 Program Status:  The EV-2 Announcement of Opportunity (AO) for fullorbital missions was released on June 17, 2011.  http://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary.do?method=init&solId={6A859523-6EB9-EBA0-7FA4-7681FE3F6AF4}&path=openThe Earth Venture Program is an element within the Earth System Science Pathfinder (ESSP)Program with the goal to enable improved understanding and prediction of climate, weatherand natural hazards. More information on the Earth Venture project is available athttp://science.nasa.gov/about-us/smd-programs/earth-system-science-pathfinder/PURPOSE OF NOTICEThe GRC EV-2 team is issuing this Notice of Partnering Opportunity for the purpose ofopenly soliciting a spacecraft partner to assist in the preparation of an Earth Venture-2proposal (http://essp.larc.nasa.gov/EV-2/) to be submitted to NASA HQ.	This open andcompetitive process is being conducted in accordance with NASA FAR Supplement 1872.308. By this Notice, the GRC EV-2 team is seeking information from partners regarding theiravailability, capabilities, past performance, and anticipated mission costs that relateto Earth science systems, technologies and capabilities for the GRC EV-2 mission.  ThisNotice also authorizes NASA GRC to award contracts to its selected spacecraft partnerwithout further competition or justification, should the proposal be selected.This partnering opportunity is being issued to select a teaming partner for the GRC EV-2spacecraft and to support the team throughout the mission.  The offeror(s) chosen willparticipate directly as a member of the proposal team in the various stages of the GRCEV-2 mission design and proposal process.PARTICIPATIONParticipation in this partnering synopsis is open to all categories of U.S. and non-U.S.organizations, including educational institutions, industry, not-for-profit institutions,the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, as well as NASA Centers and other U.S. GovernmentAgencies. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Other MinorityUniversities (OMUs), small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs)(8a), veteran-owned smallbusinesses, service disabled veteran-owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses,and women-owned small businesses (WOSBs) are encouraged to apply. Participation bynon-U.S. organizations is welcome but subject to NASAs policy of no exchange of funds, inwhich each government supports its own national participants and associated costs.SECTION 2  SCOPE	OVERVIEWThis Notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into acontract.  This Notice is subject to revision or cancellation at any time.Based on the responses to this Notice, GRC anticipates selecting one or multipleinstrument suppliers and a single spacecraft vendor with which GRC would then immediatelywork directly with in development of the GRC EV-2 mission.  During the proposaldevelopment phase, more specific roles and cost estimates for the selected partners willbe developed.  If the GRC EV-2 proposal is selected, GRC intends to negotiate withoutfurther competition or justification, a contract with the proposal partner, consistentwith their agreed upon role and this Notice.  During these contract negotiations, thespecific statement of work, contract terms and conditions, and contract value will beformalized.  There will be no exchange of funds between NASA and the selected partner for the GRC EV-2proposal development.  That is, NASA will not be responsible for any costs incurred byrespondents in preparing a response to this Notice or by the selected partner inpreparation of the GRC EV-2 proposal.DETAILS OF THE OPPORTUNITYGRC EV-2 Schedule:  Schedule:  The following schedule describes the major milestones for the Earth Ventureproposal.AO release:				June 17, 2011Proposals Due:			September 15, 2011Selection Announced:			NASA Fiscal Year 2012Launch: 			With in ATP + 5yearsPre-selection proposal supportThe potential partner shall provide support using their own resources.	This willinvolve:Weekly telecom meetings with the science and engineering teamHelping to define the end-to-end performance requirements, including instrumentinterfaces with the spacecraft, etc.Defining the flight system architecture, including launch vehicle interfacesIdentifying study topics, prediction performance, and conducting trade studiesCost estimation for all mission phases, including spacecraft disposal at end-of-missionPreparation of the mission proposal for submittal to NASA Face to Face Meetings include: kick off meeting, Red Team ReviewUpdates to technical, cost and schedule inputs as required for integrated proposalsubmittalIt is expected that the selected partner would provide (at no cost to NASA), conceptualdesigns, technical data, proposal inputs, schedule and cost estimates consistent with theproposal AO when released.EARTH VENTURE SPACECRAFTThe offeror must propose a single spacecraft carrying the GRC EV-2 science payload.   Itis imperative that the responses demonstrate a clear understanding of how such flightsystems will be built, deployed, and operated within the constraints of the Earth Venture2 cost cap.  The responses shall include the spacecraft and all associated subsystems. The launch vehicle shall be provided by NASA and should not be included.  The proposedspacecraft should be compatible with a NASA-provided Expendable Launch Vehicle (ELV), notlimited to, but most likely a Pegasus or Falcon 1.  This element also includes instrumentaccommodation.The spacecraft is expected to operate in circular Low Earth Orbit (LEO) at a sunsynchronous inclination of between 92-98 degrees and an altitude of 600-800km (+/- 10km). Final orbit altitude has yet to be determined.The remote optical sensing instruments will be operated over an expected operational lifeof 3 years.  During that period the spacecraft requirements are shown in Table 1.  Thesensors (1-3) will have observing fields towards earth NADIR and at a -20 to -30o offsetfrom the orbit path, with both forward and backward observation with respect to theflight path.  The sensors and their electronics could have an integrated mass as much as~75kg, and operate with an average power of up to75 watts (nominal, no contingency).  Itis anticipated there will be two instruments, one approximately 25cm x 25cm x 25cm, andthe second approximately 50cm x 50cm x50cm..  There are possible moving mirror assemblieswithin the instruments.  The instruments are planned to operate at a near 100% dutycycle.Parameter	RequirementControl/Knowledge	3-Axis StabilizedAttitude Pointing Control	360 arcsecPointing Knowledge	75 arcsecPointing Stability (jitter)	2.0 arcsec/secTable 1.  Attitude Control System (ACS)The ACS should minimize optical contamination on the science instruments.The spacecraft architecture should be able to provide thermal control for the scienceinstruments.  The spacecraft and mission architecture should not preclude the use of anactive thermal control system should the instruments require active cooling.The spacecraft and ground support network architectures should support a science datadownlink volume as large as 150 Gbyte/24-hours and the spacecraft should have S, X, andKu band options.Proposers should address how requirements will be identified and tracked and how theinterfaces will be managed.  The responder will be judged on the systems engineeringapproach and plan.  This plan should also identify major milestones and facilitiesavailable for assembling and testing each component and as an integrated system. Integration and test (I&T) includes the science payload integration, the spacecraft busintegration, overall I&T of the spacecraft, transportation to the launch site, launchvehicle integration, launch support, on-orbit support, and spacecraft end of lifedisposition.SECTION 3  RESPONSES TO NOTICEThe evaluation team will use the following factors in selection and award.

<DESC>SMALL BUSINESS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE
<p>Notice Number: HHS-NIH-NCI-SBSS-TSB-17008-02<br /><br />Title: PS-OC Network Bioresource Core Facility (PBCF)</p>
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement as a set-aside based upon the responses to this Notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Interested parties are expected to review this Notice and the draft Statement of Work (SOW) to familiarize themselves with the requirements of this project; failure to do so will be at your firm's own risk.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The Office of Physical Sciences-Oncology (OPSO) currently houses the Physical Sciences-Oncology Centers (PS-OC) program. Each Physical Sciences-Oncology Center (PS-OC) has unique capabilities in terms of its physical science approach to studying cancer. In order to develop a common language among the Centers, a pilot project was proposed to utilize common cell lines and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) so that physical science metrics could be easily standardized across the PS-OC Network. To test the feasibility of providing an initial common benchmark, the pilot cell line project was initiated in November 2009. Participating laboratories within the PS-OC Network carried out and shared the results of a set of pilot experiments utilizing two (2) human breast cancer cell lines to facilitate inter-PS-OC communications and accelerate the understanding of PS-OC specific technologies and techniques. The cell lines were authenticated and distributed along with necessary cell culture reagents from a single laboratory to ensure that all participants were starting with the same biospecimens. Furthermore, a standard operating procedure was developed. Results of the cell line project were presented at the PS-OC First Annual Network Investigators' Meeting in April 2010 and also at a follow-up meeting in June 2010. A Network publication is anticipated as a result of this pilot project in 2011.</p>
<p>From the PS-OC pilot cell line project, it has become apparent that utilization of cell lines and tissues with common reagents and standard operating procedures is critical for cross comparison of data sets. The PS-OC Program falls within the Physical Sciences-Oncology Network where the Physical Sciences-Oncology Network members are defined as investigators supported by the NCI OPSO and their collaborators. Because members of the Physical Sciences-Oncology Network study at least sixteen (16) different types of cancer, there is need for the establishment of a PS-OC Network Bioresource Core Facility (PBCF). The PBCF shall be a centralized biodistributor and biorepository that serves to provide Physical Sciences-Oncology Network members with common, standardized stocks of authenticated cell lines and primary cells (non-malignant and cancerous), cell culture reagents and related SOPs upon request. The PBCF shall also have the capability to prepare and distribute extracts of RNA, DNA and protein from human cell lines, primary cells and tissues. Moreover, any modified cell lines could be deposited by Physical Sciences-Oncology Network members to the PBCF for authentication and distribution to collaborators within the Physical Sciences-Oncology Network. In coordination with the PBCF, designated members of the Physical Sciences-Oncology Network will assist in the maintenance of SOP development. The PBCF shall develop a website for use by the Physical Sciences-Oncology Network members to provide product information and to function as an online ordering system.<br /><br />The requirement outlined in the attached draft statement of work (SOW) is a follow-on requirement for the NCI OPSO, and it shall continue to support both the mission of the PS-OC program and OPSO through providing a centralized resource of standardized biological specimens for Physical Sciences-Oncology Network members. The PBCF shall ultimately function to increase both the time and cost efficiency of the transfer of biological specimens to Physical Sciences-Oncology Network members.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives:</p>
<p>The purpose of this Small Business Sources Sought Notice is to identify qualified small business concerns, including HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses that are interested in and capable of performing the work described herein. The NCI does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses received nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted.</p>
<p>As a result this SBSS Notice, the NCI may issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ). THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NCI shall arise as a result of a response to this Small Business Sources Sought Notice or the NCI's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.</p>
<p>If a RFQ is issued, the NCI anticipates that one (1) award may result from the issuance of the RFQ.</p>
<p>The goal of this project is to provide a central bioresource core facility, the PS-OC Network Bioresource Core Facility (PBCF), to all members of the Physical Sciences-Oncology Network. The PBCF shall serve as a biorepository and a distributor of standardized biospecimens and their molecular derivatives to the Physical Sciences-Oncology Network members. The intent is to procure this requirement as a commercial item purchase order.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) in Orlando, Florida is responsible for acquisition, fielding and life cycle support of training systems.   Fielded Training Device (FTD) 2F196-1 was recently relocated to Marine Corps Air Station New River, North Carolina with no accompanying spare and repair parts.  Ensuring the availability of a material support package after the trainer has been relocated is critical in fulfilling NAWCTSDâs responsibility. The spare and repair parts must meet form, fit and function requirements and are commercially available from the brand name vendors listed in Attachment 1 - Brand Name Spare and Repair Parts List.  The brand name spare and repair parts are the focus of this notice, pending issuance of a Justification and Approval.
  NAWCTSD intends on awarding a competitive Commercial Item Purchase Order to a company who can provide the multiple brand names spare and repair items. The total estimated amount of this order is expected to approach $460,000.

Pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulations 6.302-1(c) application for brand name description, the proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit for a specific brand name and serves as a pre-solicitation notice of this contract action.  The intent of this notice is to meet the market research requirement and to justify that the use of such brand name descriptions are essential to the Governmentâs requirements.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, interested parties not identified within Attachment 1 are encouraged to express their interest and capability to respond to the requirements.
  Responses to this Sources Sought notice shall be received no later than close of business 5 July 2011.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether respondents are capable of meeting the Governmentâs requirements.  In those situations where the Government determines that the brand name descriptions are not essential, and are available from more than one source, the brand name requirements will be replaced with brand name or equal requirements, if applicable.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract action will be based upon responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC><p>Request for Information- Nurse, Vocational Rehabilitation, and Medical Advisor Services</p>
<p>RFI Number DOL111RI21281<br />Notice Type: Request for Information (RFI)</p>
<p>SYNOPSIS</p>
<p>The United States Department of Labor (DOL) is conducting market research to determine feasibility for a potential procurement requirement. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information from industry vendors regarding their interest, capabilities, and recommendations in developing proposals for the Office of Workers Compensation Programs' (OWCP) medical case file review, nurse case management, and vocational rehabilitation services for the Division of Federal Employees' Compensation (DFEC) and the Division of Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation (DEEOIC). The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this request is 541990. The small business size is $7.0 million. SMALL BUSINESSES ARE ENCOURAGED TO RESPOND. Include whether or not you are a small business; HUBZone small business; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small business; women-owned small business; or small disadvantaged business in order to assist the government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.</p>
<p>GENERAL PURPOSE</p>
<p>1.0 Purpose</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Labor, Office of Workers Compensation Programs administers four workers' compensation programs that mitigate the impact of work-related injuries for specified workers, through the provision and management of medical treatment and other benefits. The purpose of this Request for Information is twofold: First, to gather information that will assist the OWCP in planning, formulating, and evaluating vendor capability of executing national program requirements. The OWCP is also open to alternative ideas and respondents are encouraged to provide information about alternative solutions that may assist the OWCP to better meet the program requirements.</p>
<p>Secondly, responses to this RFI will help the OWCP assess whether the marketplace has vendors capable of supplying medical case file review, nursing, and vocational rehabilitation services and whether the vendor is capable of providing trained, professionally-certified and qualified staff to manage these services in all 50 States and territories.</p>
<p>1.1 Acquisition Approach</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Labor has not determined the acquisition approach. This market research will allow DOL to make an informed decision about how to proceed.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>2.0 Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA)</p>
<p>The OWCP's Division of Federal Employees' Compensation strives to return injured or ill workers to suitable employment through the utilization of medical case file review, nurse case management and vocational rehabilitation services. The DFEC requires the services of District Medical Advisors (DMAs), telephonic nurses, field nurses and vocational rehabilitation specialists/counselors.</p>
<p>2.0.1 DMAs: Medical case file review services are conducted by board certified physicians, acting as District Medical Advisors (DMAs). DMAs' medical file reviews consist of evaluating medical evidence related to causality, disability, permanent impairments, surgical intervention and medical treatment. The DMAs must be well-versed in the utilization and application of the AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, particularly the 6th Edition when evaluating and analyzing the degree of permanent impairment and the appropriate rating calculation.</p>
<p>2.0.2 Telephonic/Field Nurses: Early nurse intervention during the initial period of impairment is one of the major components of quality case management procedures. The type of nursing intervention needed is based on the nature and severity of the claimant's medical condition, geographic location, and other factors. Nurse case management services are divided into two categories, telephonic and field nursing services. Nurses are contracted to facilitate medical treatment, interact with health care provider(s) to ascertain work limitations, and collaborate with agency officials in the identification of potential work assignments for return to work or re-employment with the date of injury employer. Nurses are to be staffed according to standard criteria that include the appropriate educational background, licensing, clinical experience, medical case management, and specific workers' compensation or occupational health nursing experience to perform these services.<br /><br />o Telephonic nurses are assigned cases at early onset to assist injured workers in a "no work" capacity to obtain medical treatment while facilitating a return to light or full duty with the employing agency.<br /><br />o Field nurses (FN) are assigned when a return to work has not been accomplished through use of a telephonic nurse; face to face interaction is needed with the health care provider(s); or for a complex/catastrophic case requiring specialized medical case management. The FN evaluates treatment plans, projected length of disability, and whether return to work plans are available and feasible. The FN collaborates with all parties (Claims Examiner, Staff Nurse, physician, agency, claimant and possibly the Rehabilitation Counselor) to facilitate the injured worker's successful return to employment.</p>
<p>2.0.3 Voc/Rehab: When return to work efforts are exhausted or work limitations prevent a return to work or reemployment with the date-of-injury employer, vocational rehabilitation specialists/counselors are contracted to assist with vocational testing and/or training and job placement services. These services may also be provided in conjunction with a placement effort with the previous employer in certain instances.</p>
<p>The goal of the vocational rehabilitation is to seek or arrange for suitable work with the employing agency. When these efforts have been exhausted or when reemployment with the employing agency is not possible, the claimant is provided vocational assistance and placement services to secure work with a new employer. The vocational rehabilitation counselor initiates vocational testing and training to explore different employment opportunities capable of accommodating the permanent limitations. Vocational rehabilitation services may also include overseeing medical rehabilitation services that may be needed to correct, minimize or modify an impairment caused by the injury or disease so the claimant can return to an adequate level of function and employment. The vocational rehabilitation counselor may also need to facilitate physical, occupational or speech therapy, orthotics, and prosthetics. While the RC may recommend such services, the CE must authorize them.</p>
<p>The following case volumes are estimated for the first twelve months.<br /><br />DMA: 20,130 cases per year<br />Telephonic Nurse: 11,725 cases per year<br />Field Nurse: 15,596 case per year<br />Vocational Rehabilitation: 3,851 cases per year</p>
<p>2.1 Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act (EEOICPA)</p>
<p>The Division of Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation is investigating the use of registered nurses (Energy Nurses) to conduct case file reviews to evaluate and make recommendations on in-home health care service requests. The RN will conduct evaluation of physician-directed care plans to assess medical necessity of prescribed level of in-home health care services in conjunction with a patient's accepted work-related illness(es). Other duties will be to ensure development actions adhere to the written guidance provided in program procedures, circulars or transmittals. The RN will also make recommendations on the medical appropriateness of requested home health services including: tasks and duties to be performed, duration of care required per day/week and the professional service level, i.e., RN/LPN/Home Health Aid. The RN will conduct assessment of daily/weekly home health provider records to ensure compliance with prescribed treatment plan and identify anomalies or other deficiencies which require physician intervention. Responsibilities will include verbal interaction with claims staff, physicians, claimants, or service providers to coordinate necessary care, collect information, and provide guidance.</p>

<DESC>A market survey is being conducted to determine if there are a reasonable number of interested small business concerns to set this future project aside for them. If your firm is a Small Business, certified HUBZONE, 8A, or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Business and you are interested in this project please respond appropriately. The proposed scope for this project includes full-depth and width Portland Cement Concrete (PCC) pavement replacement of the northern segment of Taxiway B from N1 to Runway 23L.

<SOLNBR>M6785411I2312
<RESPDATE>072011
<ARCHDATE>08222011
<CONTACT>Capt Josh Dixon (703) 432-4203
joshua.dixon@usmc.mil
<DESC>This is a request for information (RFI) surrounding commercially available or emerging trusted handheld platforms (i.e., smartphones, tablets, etc.).  These trusted handhelds contain the ability to host multiple guest operating systems (OSs).  The idea is to provide a high level of assurance through a separation kernel and still maintain a high level of functionality through innovative modern mobile operating systems (i.e., guest OSs).  The purpose of this RFI is for the Marine Corps to learn more about this emerging technology.  The current Department of Defense (DoD) solutions for secure mobile communications fails to provide a low cost, high functional and short procurement timeline for enterprise level deployment.
  The desired solution is expected to support secure and unsecure communications for commercial markets.  The ideal solution provides a high-assurance commercially-available framework that the DoD can build upon to meet military specific requirements. 

BACKGROUND:

Based on various publicly announced partnerships between high assurance platform providers and mobile handheld device manufacturers, the Marine Corps believes this evolving commercial demand, if leveraged appropriately, could help offset the traditional high cost surrounding this capability.  Across the DoD, various organizations are establishing programs to remove functionality or âhardenâ the commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) handheld devices for sensitive communications.
  However, this model is extremely difficult to maintain, because by the time the platforms are âhardenedâ, certified & accredited (C&A) and fielded they become obsolete or unsupported.  The problem arises when the acquisition timeline exceeds the platform lifetime. For example, the C&A process takes two years, but the handheld lifetime is only two years.  In this example, by the time the handheld is officially fielded, the technology is obsolete.  This RFI is soliciting for system architectures and business partnerships that ultimately facilitate low-cost and high-assurance handhelds.  The term âhigh assuranceâ is defined as at least meeting the common criteria for evaluated assurance level (EAL) of 5+ or above.

REQUEST FOR GENERAL INFORMATION:

1.	Describe your organization.
2.	Describe your organizations development experience surrounding high assurance platforms.
3.	Describe the market (i.e., government or commercial) that this technology might support.
4.	Describe the level of demand you anticipate for this technology.
5.	Is there potential for a legitimate market outside of the military? What requirements should exist to ensure a larger market?
6.	What political or organizational considerations are needed to produce an optimal solution?



GENERAL TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:

The ideal technical solutions should meet these minimal requirements.

1.	A family of small form factor devices (i.e., smartphone and tablet sizes) â with regard to size and weight.
2.	Each handheld device can access multiple domains (e.g., internet, intranet, secret).
3.	Each handheld device contains multiple commercial wireless interfaces (i.e., personal area network [PAN], wireless local area network [WLAN], wide area network [WAN]).
4.	The devices provide high availability for the duration of their expected lifetime.
5.	The devices are capable of installing and operating commercially available mobile operation systems.
6.	The devices leverage an inherent display to read in direct sunlight and no light.
7.	The devices are capable of reporting position location information.
8.	The devices using common commercially available device input output (I/O).
 
9.	The devices can store data to a capacity consistent with commercial mobile devices. 
10.	The devices must leverage commercial demand to offset unit price and benefit from economies of scale.
11.	The architecture is designed to facilitate a cross domain solution. 

REQUEST FOR TECHNICAL INFORMATION:

1.	Is there a commercial sponsor(s) for this type of technology? If so, what are their requirements? If possible, please provide a complete list as an attachment or addendum.
2.	What solution can meet the needs of this RFI?  Describe your solution that might solve the highlighted problem.  Provide a detailed description and drawing(s) to illustrate a proposed solution including an overview of the architecture.
3.	What technologies lack maturity to produce an optimal solution?
4.	What technical information is needed to produce an accurate (i.e., considering cost, schedule, and performance) proposal?
5.	Given your proposed solution, what power limitations are expected?
6.	Given your proposed solution, what handheld characteristics are required?
7.	Of the requirements listed in the âgeneral technical requirementsâ section, which ones are infeasible and alternatively which ones are missing?

REQUEST FOR BUSINESS AND LOGISTICAL INFORMATION:

1.	Provide a cost estimate for your solution.
2.	How long would your proposed solution take to   
        produce fieldable implementations?
3.	What limitations might delay fielding?  
4.	What logistical considerations are needed? 
5.	Is your company expecting a commercial or non-
        commercial procurement? If a commercial procurement
        is expected, what is the expected commercial demand?
6.	Has your company already partnered with other key
        providers? If so, what partners have you selected
        and why?

<DESC>The Library of Congress/FEDLINK intends to negotiate a sole source contract with the HathiTrust, managed by the University of Michigan, a non-profit educational organization located in Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109. <br />To support its research community and collection development activities in the digital arena, Libraries require participation in a digital repository that aggregates the Library's digital collections with the digital content of the nation's other largest research libraries. The digital repository must use high quality metadata created and implemented according to accepted library preservation standards (for example, PREMIS), providing researchers the powerful, multifaceted discovery and analysis capabilities they need when accessing digital content. The Library also requires that the digital repository provide long-term storage and maintenance of the Library's digital materials as well as the digital collections of the nation's largest research libraries in perpetuity at the lowest possible cost and with the public good as the primary intent.
<p>A digital repository storing Library materials must have the capacity to maintain its collections over the long-term, conforming to established digital preservation and audit standards, guidelines, and best practices such as the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) Reference Model, the Preservation Metadata Implementation Strategies (PREMIS), the Digital Repository Audit Method Based on Risk Assessment (DRAMBORA) framework, and the Trustworthy Repositories Audit &amp; Certification (TRAC). HathiTrust is the only established service that conforms to these standards and provides the aforementioned access, discovery, and analysis capabilities.</p>
<p>FEDLINK member libraries seek to join a cooperative public interest venture to support the American research library community in its effort to establish and develop a sustainable digital book preservation repository. As a member of the HathiTrust consortium, the Libraries will be positioned to encourage the growth and development of Hathi and successor entities as repositories of the nation's digital heritage.</p>
<p>Response to this notice must include technical capabilities, pricing, and other information that demonstrates ability to meet the stated requirements. Detailed capabilities must be submitted to the Contracting Officer as specified.</p>
<p>This synopsis is NOT to be considered a request for quotations or proposals. No solicitation document is available. No contract will be awarded based on offers received in response to this notice. Responses will be used to determine if a comparable source is available and more advantageous to the government.</p>

This announcement constitutes the only notice.
This is not a request for quotes.
Under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP), Fish & Wildlife Services, Region 7 Contracting and General Services intends to issue a sole source, firm-fixed price order:TO:	Thomas Burke Memorial Washington State Museum at the University of Washington Duns: 605799469	4333 Brooklyn AVE NE Seattle, WA 98195-0001
FOR :	Continued Museum curation, inventorying, reporting and storage services, by the Museum, of cultural materials (Approximately 40 cubic feet of human remains and associated artifacts and grave goods) collected or excavated on lands managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in accordance 36 CFR 79, Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA)
ON:	BASE 6/1/2011 - 5/31/2012 W/ 4 Option periods
NAICS:	611310	Colleges, Universities, and Professional Schools
AUTHORITY:	8.405-6(a)(2) Limited Sources Justification and Approval  13.106(b) Soliciting from a single source (follow on)
Determinations not to compete this proposed procurement were made because:
The Burke Museum continues to be the only repository which meets Federal curation guidelines spelled out in 36 CFR 79 that is willing to take/keep the large collection of faunal materials.  Some of these collections were deposited with the Burke in the late 1970's.  Recently the museum has become the primary repository for faunal remains from prehistoric sites in Kodiak.  In addition to their value for understanding human use and adaptation, these collections are a priceless record for understanding environmental change over the last 8,000 years. The legal authorities cited above require archeological collections from federal lands to be curated in repositories meeting stringent standards for physical security, staffing and public access.  The museum has the space, technical expertise and staffing to properly care for these collections.

Under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP), Fish & Wildlife Services, Region 7 Contracting and General Services intends to issue a sole source, firm-fixed price order:
TO:	ALASKA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND GAME (ADF&G)DUNS: 8093874751255 W 8TH STJUNEAU, AK 99801-1856
FOR :	Conduct aerial surveys to monitor the movements and distribution of the Fortymile, Nelchina and Mentasta caribou herds.  The monitoring is to be carried out in relation to season openings and hunting activities.  This information will be used to evaluate the appropriate regulatory recommendations as needed.  Revised harvest regulations go into effect for the fall 2011 hunting season, underscoring the importance of in-season monitoring.  The funding will help to defray aircraft expenses for regular radio-tracking flights during period of greatest hunter concentration, to operate check stations, and to monitor access restrictions when and where appropriate.  The product (supply) will be a report which identifies Fortymile, Nelchina and Mentasta caribou population status and trends, herd movements, hunter effort and hunter concentration areas, harvest data, enforcement problems and recommendations for regulatory changes.

NAICS:	114210	Game Propagation, Hunting and Trapping
AUTHORITY: 8.405-6(a)(2) Limited Sources Justification and Approval 13.106(b) Soliciting from a single source
Determinations not to compete this proposed procurement were made because:The proposed contractor (ADF&G) is the only responsible entity that has the capability to conduct aerial radio-tracking surveys of the subject caribou herds, to establish hunter check stations, and to monitor access restrictions.  The proposed contractor's qualifications are unique, in that they also have management responsibilities for the subject wildlife populations (when these caribou occupy non-Federal lands).  As partners (with USFWS) in the existing dual management system we have in Alaska, they are therefore exclusively qualified and experienced to carry out these activities.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE
Notice of intent to award a sole source contract to:  Onset Computer Corporation, 470 Macarthur Blvd, Bourne, MA, 02532-3838
The US Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 7, 1011 E. Tudor Rd, Anchorage, AK, 99503 has a requirement for Water Temperature data loggers to support a collaborative project to assess patterns in lake temperature dyanamics throughout western Alaska. 
Technical Requirements: Accuracy 0.20 C, over 0 to 50 C; Resolution 0.02 C at 25 C;Stability 0.1  C / year; Real-time clock  1 minute / month; Battery life 5 years @ 1 minutelogging interval; Memory 64K bytes; Minimum waterproofto 120 metersQuantity 148
Due to the remote setting of study lakes, it is necessary that water temperature sensorsbe programmable with an internal battery power, self-contained, ruggedized against adverseenvironmental conditions, and have sufficient internal memory to store data betweendeployments. Additionally, many study lakes will be located within designated wildernesswhere long-term deployment of scientific installations is often not permitted. Thus, instrumentsmust be small and inconspicuous in design to prevent impacts to the natural, undisturbed qualityof wilderness. Sensors that rely on an external power source and data logger will not meet thesample design of this study and will not be permitted within designated wilderness.Onset Computer Corporation is currently the only commercial vendor that offers a self-containedwater temperature thermistor that meets the technical requirements for this project. Othervendors offer water temperature sensors that meet or exceed the accuracy, resolution andstability requirements but these sensors are not self-contained and rely on an external datalogging and power source. 
The estimated value of this procurement is $16,777.00
This Notice of Intent is not a request for Expressions of Interest (EOIs), proposals or quotations. This service  will be procured under Firm Fixed Price in accordance with FAR 12 procedures and soliciting from a single source as authorized under FAR 13.106-1(b).
Point of contact for this acquisition is Randall Miller at (907)786-3466

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY - Solicitations are not available at this time. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. This notice does not constitute a commitment by the United States Government. The Eastern Acquisition Division (EAD) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Norfolk, VA is soliciting information on behalf of the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) for Wireless Transmission Marine Temperature and Wireless Transmission Marine Temperature-Depth (TD) Probes, a Receiver, and Software for use in fisheries related research.
<p><br />BACKGROUND</p>
<p>Many of the Northeast Region's managed fish stocks suffer from incomplete or imprecise information on fishing effort and species distribution. Integration of fishing gear's depth and temperature information with catch data may facilitate scientific and ecosystem modeling approaches. The NEFSC requires Contractor support in one or more areas of scientific investigation.</p>
<p>Currently, versions of marine temperature and temperature-depth probes are available that must be collected from fishing gear and physically paired with a data reader to retrieve the temperature and depth data. Due to the necessity of removing the probe, downloading the data, and reprogramming the probe, there is a data lag time of several days to several weeks, and can only allow for retrospective data analysis rather than real-time data use. Temperature and Temperature-Depth probes that are capable of sending the data wirelessly to an onboard receiver once the probe reaches the surface are needed to provide continuous data for use in developing more selective fishing strategies.</p>
<p>SCOPE</p>
<p>Wireless Temperature and Temperature-Depth probe systems are needed for the NEFSC's Study Fleet, Conservation Engineering, and Environmental Monitors on Lobster Traps (eMOLT) projects to improve the precision of fishing effort estimates and the collection of environmental data concurrent with fishing operations.</p>
<p>The Wireless Temperature and Temperature-Depth Probe Systems must be capable of wirelessly transmitting temperature and depth data to an onboard Receiver system upon reaching the surface during fishing activities. The contractor shall provide a system that includes Wireless Transmission Temperature Only and Temperature-Depth probes, a Receiver, and Software system.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>A. NOAA requires a Wireless Temperature-only Probe with the following capabilities:<br />1. The device must be capable of withstanding the marine environment and normal fishing activities in depths up to 500 meters;<br />2.

The device must have an internal clock capable of date and time verification through the receiver system or satellite transmission;<br />8. The device must have an equilibration &lsquo;response' time of 30 seconds or less when moved: This response time should equate to the probe's default polling rate;<br />9. The device must be capable of a user defined polling rate that can be set wirelessly through the receiver system and associated software (see paragraph C Receiver and D Device Management Application/Graphical Unit Interface); The user-specified polling rate should range from &lsquo;response time'(i.e. 30 seconds or less) to 1 hour;<br />10. The device must be capable of transmitting data wirelessly to an onboard receiver at a distance of at least 50 meters or more; <br />11. The device must be capable of wireless data transmission which may occur automatically upon the probe reaching the surface, or be triggered by a manual mechanism; <br />12. The device must be capable of both transmitting and archiving data; <br />13. The device must have a minimum memory capacity of 10,000 records and a minimum battery capacity of 50,000 records;<br />14.

<SUBJECT>A Request for Information (RFI) for Low Bulk/Low Weight Emergency Flotation for Helicopter Aviators 
<SOLNBR>RFI-016
<RESPDATE>080811
<CONTACT>Sheena L. Warner, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-737-2782, Fax 301-727-2746, Email sheena.warner@navy.mil
<DESC>The Dept of the Army and the Dept of the Navy is requesting information from government and industry for low bulk, lightweight surface flotation for the cold water survival ensemble to be developed incrementally in-house by the Naval Air Warfare Center for the Army's Air Soldier program. Program objectives are to 1) meet cold-water survival and mission requirements at 25% reduced system weight and bulk, and 2) be maintainable by an untrained user. Goals are for lighter, less bulky surface flotation that will address shortcomings below and :
<p>a) Reduce life cycle cost; <br />b) Obviate need for, or reduce the difficulty of, swimming to and boarding a raft; <br />c) Prevent/retard seawater from entering in the first place; purge any shipped seawater; <br />d) Protect the user from continued heat loss from exposure to cold air and seawater seaspray;<br />e) User-capable emergency repair (i.e., while raft deployed in water) to enable 72 hour intact flotation; <br />f) Maintain location for searchers;<br />g) and ideally, not attract sharks.<br /><br />Especially sought is the consolidation of protective functions that are currently segregated into separate layers (for example, combining surface flotation and personal flotation into a single system; buoyancy technologies that take advantage of environment (salt water activated and sustained, etc). To be avoided are technologies that require power provided by aircraft connection, or those that increase maintenance, weight and/or bulk over current technologies.</p>
<p>Background. The Air Soldier program is a system upgrade from Air Warrior. . The current CWSE consists of: individual inflatable life raft worn in a body-mounted carrier, inflatable life preserver, inflatable mittens and hood, moisture vapor transmissible dry suit with permanent wrist seals, neck seals, and socks; and insulative undergarments.</p>
<p>Current flotation includes: LPU-40/P inflatable life preserver (65 pounds buoyancy/packed weight=2 lbs) and JSLVP single-place inflatable raft (180 lbs buoyancy/packed weight=6.2 lbs; vacuum-packed dims =250 in3) both of welded, coated nylon (CO2 cartridge, dual manual pin actuation and breath-inflatable); sea anchor of welded, coated nylon pouch.</p>
<p>Shortcomings:</p>
<p>Inflatable-type flotation is at risk for puncture and leakage.</p>
<p>Inflatable-type flotation requires a leakage inspection and servicing the CO2 bottle, which both requires unpacking - but there is no re-vacuum packing/sealing support equipment available.</p>
<p>Vacuum-packed inflatable flotation often requires additional CO2 bottles to break package.<br />Current man-mounted, inflatable, single-place rafts are too bulky and hot for individual wear.</p>
<p>Multi-Place inflatable rafts often too bulky to deploy through emergency hatches.</p>
<p>Multi-Place inflatable rafts often require complicated tie-downs making emergency deployment unlikely.<br />Current sea anchor design is limited in ability to maintain position.</p>
<p>Army cold-water surface immersion protection and survival requirements: 72 hours flotation capability, retard or eliminate water ingress once deployed to aid in maintaining user's body core temperature at or above 95 deg F, hand skin temperature at or above 60deg F for 4 hours immersion turbulent 32 deg F water; maintain ability to egress from underwater aircraft (i.e., inherent system undeployed buoyancy not to exceed +175N); single-place deployed minimum flotation buoyancy of180 lbs; mobility and flexibility to perform water survival procedures without impediment. Integrated protection against natural predators is desired but not required.</p>
<p>Mission requirements: 11-hour flying time in routine ambient conditions; non-toxic to skin; resistance to environmental contaminants (sand, petroleum, oil, lubricants, solar radiation, temperature extremes of -20deg F to +140deg F, mold, mildew, salt fog); compatibility with current Army gear and equipment required to be worn with dry suits, such as inflatable flotation collars, armor, masks, gloves, helmets, and boots.</p>
<p>User: Very large and very small (central 95% of Army flying population) Army aviators (pilots, co-pilots, crewmembers but excluding passengers) of both sexes of varying composition, body and extremity shape and size. <br />Routine Maintenance: if not a disposable concept, yield a service life of 2 years; have a shelf life of 5 years; ideally, user-capable place- in-service, repair, maintenance, and support or no more than local level support.</p>
<p>CONTENT OF RFI RESPONSE</p>
<p>The capabilities described herein are intentionally broad to ensure a comprehensive market survey. Responses to this RFI should describe the capability available from each proposed alternative identified for the mission and constraints defined herein. All respondents are requested to provide the following and shall clearly identify any elements of the system that would be delivered with less than Government purpose rights:</p>

<DESC>The Dept of the Army and the Dept of the Navy is soliciting government and industry for low cost, low bulk, lightweight, innovative visible signaling technology to allow day and night detection by search and rescue personnel at a maximum of 3000 ft / 5 nautical miles to within 4 feet of the survivor and:
<p>1) Not degrade either Army cold-water immersion protection or mission requirements <br />2) Be maintainable by an untrained user. <br />3) Not interfere with day/night flight visibility.</p>
<p>Especially sought is the consolidation of protective functions that are currently segregated into separate layers, for example, luminescent technologies incorporated into personal flotation or surface flotation; luminescence technologies that take advantage of resources abundant in the near environment (e.g. water movement, wind, salt water activated and sustained, etc).<br /><br />To be avoided are technologies that a) require power provided by aircraft connection, or b) impose greater maintenance, weight and/or bulk.<br /><br />Current emergency visibility technology includes: LPU flotation bladder is Bright Yellow; no retro-reflective tape is used on Army helmets; typically, an acrylic signaling mirror is carried; rarely is a strobe light or flares available due to cost.</p>
<p>Current shortcomings: All items require one-handed dexterity to locate and operate. No item except strobe is visible @ 3000ft / 5 nautical miles, and the strobe is not always visible in day.</p>
<p>Army requirements for cold-water surface immersion protection and survival:</p>
<p>a) maintain user's body core temperature at or above 95 deg F,<br />b) hand skin temperature at or above 60deg F for 4 hours immersion turbulent 32 deg Fwater; <br />c) ability to egress from underwater aircraft (i.e., inherent system buoyancy not to exceed +175N); <br />d) minimum flotation buoyancy of 156N; <br />e) Mobility and flexibility to perform water survival procedures without impediment. <br />f)Integrated protection against natural predators is desired but not required.</p>
<p>Air Soldier/CWSE Background. The Air Soldier program is a system upgrade from Air Warrior seeking to reduce weight and bulk by 15-30%.

1.   INTRODUCTION:The Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) funds sixty-six (66) Homeliving programs of which 14 are peripheral. Peripheral dorm students attend public schools and students live in the dorm during the week. There are approximately 9,400 students residing in dormitories and over 1200 Homeliving staff members.  On December, 2007, final Homeliving Program regulations, 25 CFR Part 36, were published with implementation effective January 4, 2008 for all BIE funded schools that operate dormitory or peripheral dormitory programs.  The emphasis on improving the skills, knowledge and care-giving strategies of Homeliving staff is evident in the regulations.  
2.   BACKGROUND:The BIE has been concerned about what constitutes the quality of care for American Indian students living in Homeliving programs. Positive and quality Homeliving programs create safe and responsive environments that promote healthy development of children and youth.  It is critical that students in Homeliving settings experience a sense of belonging, supported by healthy peer and adult relationships so that they are prepared to become productive and successful tribal members. 
3.   SCOPEBIE requires professional development, technical assistance, and training for their Homeliving staff to strengthen staff skills, to enhance staff knowledge, and to successfully develop a culture of care for dorm students.

To impact the schools in targeted areas that will improve student achievement, the BIE has developed the BIE "Reads" program and the "Math Counts" for implementation in schools that in the persistently lowest performing 5% of schools.  To accomplish the implementation of these instructional support intervention programs the BIE proposes to develop a network of professional support for these schools.

  Additionally, the vendor shall fully explain their ability to meet the requirements from above.  Shipping shall be FOB Destination.  Quote shall specify the Total Price.  Quotes will be evaluated for Completeness (all CLINS are priced).   Adequate competition is anticipated for this acquisition.  The government anticipates award of a Firm Fixed Price contract.

Include any applicable discounts to the Government.

The offeror should describe its past performance on three (3) similar contracts it has held within the last three (3) years which are for the same or similar equipment to that which is detailed in this solicitation or affirmatively state that offeror possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.
 Offerors who present similar contracts should provide a detailed explanation demonstrating the relevance of the contracts to the requirements of the solicitation. The offeror should provide the following information regarding its past performance:

1. Contract number(s), award date and dates of performance.
2. Name, phone number, and e-mail address of a point of contact at the federal, state, local government or commercial entity for which the contract was performed.

5. The number, type and severity of any quality or delivery problems in performing the contract, the corrective action taken and the effectiveness of the corrective action (if applicable).
6.
 Any other relevant information.


EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD:

The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer is the Best Value, cost and other factors considered.  The technical and past performance factors, factors a. and b. below, combined are significantly more important than price, and are listed in descending order of importance.  However, price may become a critical factor in the event that two or more offerors are determined to be essentially equal following the evaluation of technical and past performance factors.  Evaluation of price will be based on the offerorâs total price for all line items.

The Factors identified below are in descending order of importance and will be the evaluation factors used to evaluate all offers received:
a.	Technical Approach- The offeror shall provide in detail a technical approach that will successfully accomplish the requirements of the solicitation and should address the offerorsâ proposed methodology for performing the requirements of the solicitation.

The offeror should describe any risks associated with the solicitation, including the performance work statement and any risks associated with implementation of the offerorâs technical approach; describe any techniques and actions to mitigate such risks; and explain whether the techniques and actions identified for risk mitigation have been successfully used by the offeror.
  The offeror should provide any other information the offeror considers relevant to the solicitation.

b. Past Performance - The Offeror shall submit at least three (3), but not more than five (5) past performance contract descriptions, over the past three (3) years which are relevant to the efforts required by this solicitation. The Offeror shall demonstrate relevant past performance or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant past performance.  Relevant past performance is performance under contracts or efforts that is of similar scope, and magnitude to that which is described in the solicitation.  The offeror should address its past performance in complying with requirements of the clauses at FAR 52.219-8, "Utilization of Small Business Concerns," and 52.219-9, "Small Business Subcontracting Plan."

The Government reserves the right to use alternative resources to gather past performance information.
  Offerors lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance, but shall be rated neutral.  However, the proposal of an offeror with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors.  The offeror should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  If an offeror fails to provide any past performance information which is similar in scope, and magnitude to that which is detailed in the RFP or fails to affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance, the offer may not be awardable.
   The Government will consider the quality of offerorâs past performance.  This consideration is separate and distinct from the Contracting Officerâs responsibility determination.  The assessment of the offerorâs past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the offeror and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFP.  In determining the rating for the past performance evaluation factor, the Government will give greater consideration to the contracts which the Government feels are most relevant to the RFP.

c. Price â Offerors shall provide a firm fixed price for all line items.

The offerorâs initial proposal shall contain the offerorâs best terms from a price and technical standpoint.
   The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions, but reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.  The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest offeror if the Government determines that a price premium is warranted due to technical merit.  The Government reserves the right to award to other than the highest rated offeror.  The Government reserves the right to make no award as a result of this solicitation.  

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

TECHNICAL PROPOSAL RATING STANDARDS

Rating	Definition and Criteria
Exceptional (E)	The proposal has exceptional merit and reflects an excellent approach which should clearly result in the superior attainment of all requirements and objectives.
  The proposed approach includes numerous substantial advantages, and essentially no disadvantages, and can be expected to result in outstanding performance.  The solutions proposed are considered very low risk in that they are exceptionally clear and precise, fully supported, and demonstrate a complete understanding of the requirements. 

Good (G)	The proposal demonstrates a sound approach which is expected to meet all requirements and objectives.  This approach includes substantial advantages, and few relatively minor disadvantages, which collectively can be expected to result in better than satisfactory performance.  The solutions proposed are considered to reflect low risk in that they are clear and precise, supported, and demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirements.
 

Acceptable (A)	The proposal demonstrates an approach which is capable of meeting all requirements and objectives.  The approach may have both advantages and disadvantages, however, any disadvantages do not outweigh the advantages and the approach can be expected to result in satisfactory performance.  The solutions proposed are considered to reflect moderate risk in that they are for the most part clear, precise, and supported, and demonstrate a general understanding of all the requirements. 

Marginal (M)	The proposal does not demonstrate a full understanding of all the requirements and may pose a risk that the offeror might fail to perform satisfactorily without significant Government oversight or participation.
  Any advantages that may exist in the approach are outweighed by existing disadvantages.  The solutions proposed are considered to reflect high risk in that they lack clarity and precision, or are unsupported. 

Unacceptable (U)	The proposal demonstrates an approach which will very likely not be capable of meeting all requirements and objectives.  This approach has one or more substantial disadvantages or contains a deficiency or deficiencies.  Collectively, the advantages and disadvantages are not likely to result in satisfactory performance.  The solutions proposed are considered to reflect very high risk in that they lack any clarity or precision, are unsupported, or indicate a lack of understanding of the requirement.




PAST PERFORMANCE RATING STANDARDS

Rating	Definition and Criteria
Low Risk (LR)	Verification of past performance shows that the offeror consistently meets work schedules, provides specified services, meets contract terms without failure or resolves issues immediately, and has not been defaulted on any contract within the past three years.

Moderate Risk (MR)	Verification of past performance shows that the offeror meets work schedules and specified services most of the time, meets contract terms without failure or resolves issues immediately, and has not been defaulted on any contract within the past three years.

High Risk (HR)	Verification of past performance shows that the offeror has consistently not met work schedules and other obligations, has defaulted on at least one contract within the past three years, or has chronically failed to meet contract terms, or the past performance information provided is not relevant to this requirement.

Unknown Risk (UR)	No record of past performance or contact information (telephone, facsimile, or electronic mail address) is available and/or is not valid and/or the points of contact or agencies could not be reached.

IAW FAR 15.305(a) (2) (iv), in the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.

IRCA - Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986		INA - Immigration and Nationality Act		INS - Immigration and Naturalization Service 		SSA - Social Security Administration		INS SAVE Program - The INS Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements Program		ESA - Employment Standards Administration (Department of Labor)
(a) Authority.  Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (8 USC 1101 as amended) and the Immigration and Nationality Act, Section 274A.
 	(b) Who is Covered.  INA includes provisions addressing employment eligibility, employment verification, and nondiscrimination.  These provisions apply to all employers, including government contractors.
 	(c) Basic Provisions/Requirements.   Under IRCA, employers may hire only persons who may legally work in the U.S., i.e., citizens and nationals of the U.S. and aliens authorized to work in the U.S.  The employer must verify the identity and employment eligibility of anyone to be hired, which includes completing the Employment Eligibility Verification Form (I-9).  Employers must keep each I-9 on file for at least three years, or one year after employment ends, whichever is longer.  Detailed guidance on the I-9 is available at the INS web site:http://www.ins.gov/graphics/services/employerinfo/index.htm .
	(d) Employment Verification Pilot Programs.  The INS and the SSA are conducting the following programs that provide employers a way to confirm the employment eligibility of their newly hired employees.  Any employer located in a pilot state may volunteer to participate in a pilot program.  If employers are not located in a pilot state, they would verify employment eligibility by following the procedures currently in place, i.e., by completing Form I-9.
(1) The Basic Pilot is a joint pilot being conducted by the INS and SSA in the States of California, Florida, Illinois, Nebraska, New York, and Texas. This pilot involves verification checks of the SSA and INS databases of all newly hired employees, regardless of citizenship. To receive information on the Basic Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981, or write to USINS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO Building 4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536. You may also contact the Social Security Administration by calling (410) 966-1940, or writing to Social Security Administration, Office of Program Benefits Policy, 6401 Security Blvd., 760 Altmeyer, Baltimore, MD 21235.
(2) The INS is conducting the Citizen Attestation Pilot in the States of Arizona, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, and Virginia.  The Citizen Attestation Pilot permits participating employers to electronically verify the employment eligibility of newly hired alien employees by using a personal computer with a modem.  To receive information on the Citizen Attestation Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981.  Employers may also write to US/INS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO-4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536.
(3) The INS and the SSA are conducting the Machine-Readable Document Pilot in the State of Iowa. The Machine-Readable Document Pilot is identical to the Basic Pilot in all respects, except for the geographic scope of the pilot and for one additional feature.  If an employee presents an Iowa's driver's license or identification card containing a machine-readable SSN, the employer will make an inquiry through the confirmation system by using the machine-readable feature.  To receive information on the Machine-Readable Document Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981. You may also write to US/INS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO-4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536.
 	(e) Employee Rights.  The INA protects U.S. citizens and aliens authorized to accept employment in the U.S. from discrimination in hiring or discharge on the basis of national origin and citizenship status.
 	(f) Compliance Assistance.  More detailed information, including copies of explanatory brochures and regulatory and interpretative materials, may be obtained from local offices of the Department of Labor's Employment Standards Division, Wage and Hour Division, and the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs.
 	(g) Penalties/Sanctions.  Employers who fail to complete and/or retain the I-9 forms are subject to penalties. The INS enforces the INA requirements on verification of employment eligibility. The Justice Department enforces the anti-discrimination provisions.  As part of their ongoing enforcement efforts, the ESA's Wage and Hour Division and Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs conduct inspections of the I-9 forms.  They report their findings to the INS and to the Department of Justice when they find cases of disparate treatment or unauthorized employment.  A debarring official may debar a contractor, based on a determination by the Attorney General of the United States, or designee, that the contractor is not in compliance with the INA. The Attorney General's determination is not reviewable in the debarment proceedings.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, in conjunction with FAR 13.5, as applicable, and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is 1086898-1 and is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). Quotations are due 10 days from the publication date of this synopsis or 30 June 2011, by 12:00 p.m. EST, local prevailing time in Atlanta, GA at the Food and Drug Administration, ATTN: Thomas Dumas, 60 8th St., NE, Atlanta, GA 30309. The quotation must reference solicitation number 1086898-1. The offers are due in person, by mail or email. The solicitation document and incorporated clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-52, effective May 31, 2011. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334516- Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing and business size is 500 employees.
<p>The Food and Drug Administration, Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) is establishing a Core Nanotechnology Facility and has a need for an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) in order to characterize nanomaterial morphology and behavior in FDA regulated products. The Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) allows a user high resolution and three-dimensional information. It also allows the user to probe and observe a vast array of nanomaterials in native, intended, unintended and biological environments.</p>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration, Center for Devices and Radiological Health through Market Research have identified the Agilent 5500 AFM/SFM System as an instrument that meet the requirements for their needs.</p>
<p>The Office of Acquisition and Grants Services intends to purchase Brand Name or Equal to the Agilent 5500 AFM/SPM System to include two (2) one (1) year options to extend the manufacturer service warranty.</p>
<p>Salient Characteristics of the instrument:</p>
<p>&bull; The system shall have an environmental chamber which is integrated with the microscope head for fast sample loading, have a gasket seal for complete isolation of gases in the chamber from the scanner and have a minimum of four ports for gas and/or electrical connectors. The chamber shall be constructed of optically transparent and solvent/acid/base resistant material to allow viewing of the sample during operation. The chamber shall be air-tight at moderate positive and negative pressures (as opposed to a "purge chamber" requiring a continuous flow of gasses). The system shall be compatible and tolerant of a condensing environment as well. Systems that use a simple "purge" chamber are not sufficient and can lead to instrument failure due to gases, fumes, or water vapor damaging the instruments' electronics.</p>
<p>&bull; All scanner and detector electronic components must be sealed from the sample environment without reducing access to the sample area. This capability is critical for state-of-the-art electrochemistry and environmental control.</p>
<p>&bull; The system shall have heating and cooling options (minimum total range that can be covered is -5C to 250C) which are available for air and solution imaging. All heating and cooling options shall be compatible with fluid cells and fluid operation or while under gaseous environmental control. Temperature control accuracy is 0.1C or better</p>
<p>&bull; All imaging is done with a top down scanner (sample always stationary and tip/cantilever scanning) for sample size flexibility and adaptability of system to inverted light microscopes or other techniques like electrochemistry that require ample access to the sample and tip area. This type of design also removes the danger of scanner damage from fluids.</p>
<p>&bull; System shall be able to perform oscillating probe AFM techniques in fluid which include both acoustic mode and magnetically coupled mode (MAC). The design allows the ultimate in flexibility due to being able to magnetically excite the probe from either below or above the sample all while not limiting the system to any applications.</p>
<p>&bull; The system shall accommodate samples of at least 50mm x 50mm and have provisions for imaging samples on glass slides and cover slips. The system shall be able to resolve the atomic lattice structure of Mica in contact mode deflection images in order to demonstrate high resolution capabilities of system.</p>
<p>&bull; System shall include fluid cells which fit on interchangeable sample plates for heating, cooling, or MAC and acoustic AC modes. The fluid cells are constructed of Kel-F (or similar) and are available in Teflon, are held with quick clamping mechanism for fast assembly, and are priced economically so that they can be conveniently replaced or spares provided to prevent cross-contamination of biological experiments or allow multiple users to prepare for experiments simultaneously.</p>
<p>&bull; Sample plates/holders shall be interchangeable with options for heating, cooling, MAC and acoustic AC, or electrochemistry modes. The sample plates shall be compatible with fluid cells described above, have quick clamping electrode holders for all EC electrodes, and have integral connector for electrochemistry electrode connections.</p>
<p>&bull; The systems' scanners shall have interchangeable cantilever holders that are hermetically sealed from the environment and provide for the following modes of operation: STM, AFM, CSAFM, Oscillating probe/AC-AFM, EFM, LFM, MAC, etc. The system shall include such cantilever holders for AFM, CSAFM, AC-AFM, and EFM operation in air, fluid, controlled temperature, or controlled environments. The system shall include a large range (90um x 90um x 7um) scanner which is closed-loop in X, Y, &amp; Z axes. Toggling on/off the closed-loop control does not require the user to stop scanning.</p>
<p>&bull; Agilent's electrochemical SPM capabilities include a complete kit for high-resolution in situ Electrochemistry-SPM experiments. Electrochemical SPM offers a low-noise potentiostat/galvanostat for in situ EC-SPM studies (both EC-AFM &amp; EC-STM). When combined with temperature control, it is possible to obtain valuable information about electrochemical processes that would otherwise be inaccessible. The addition of environmental control allows imaging with no dissolved oxygen in either aqueous or non-aqueous solutions. Advanced functions and analyses of the EC option include background subtraction, EC plot line integration between cursors allowing integration above or below user-defined line, and integration of current vs. time for charge measurements.</p>
<p>&bull; The system provides Single Pass Electric Measurements such as Kelvin Force Microscopy (KFM). Measurements can be faster, with higher spatial resolution and less susceptibility to drift than other "interleave" methods. The KFM option provides quantitative surface potential/work-function imaging with high lateral resolution (~1-2nm) and no variability due to operating frequency or excitation voltage and with an extremely linear response. Surface Potential, dC/dV and dC/dZ measurements are also possible with no additional hardware.</p>
<p>&bull; The system must be capable of operating as a standalone unit with all capabilities described above or operating on an inverted light microscope by quickly moving the microscope head onto an inverted light microscope adapter stage.</p>
<p>&bull; The system must come with a separate STM scanner.</p>
<p>&bull; The system must have the capability to automatically calibrate the spring constant of the cantilever using the thermal tuning method.</p>
<p>&bull; The system must come with an integrated vibration/acoustic isolation chamber.</p>
<p>&bull; The system must come with an Advanced level of analysis software that provides an easy-to-use desktop publishing environment for fast and accurate metrology report generation, surface analysis workflow for full metrological traceability, allows the user to user to work in a multi-language environment such as English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Spanish, Japanese or Chinese to build the analysis document, and conforms to ISO standards.</p>
<p>&bull; The system must include installation and training of at least 2 days.</p>
<p>&bull; The system must include a 1 year warranty standard manufacturer warranty.</p>

<p>Technical Capability: Prototypes are acceptable, demonstration models, used or refurbished instruments will be considered. Evaluation of technical capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation. NIST will evaluate whether the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds all minimum requirements. Quotations that do not demonstrate the proposed equipment meets all requirements will not be considered further for award. If an offeror does not indicate whether its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate that their proposed equipment exceeds NIST's requirements.</p>
<p>Stronger Preference:</p>
<p>Under the Technical Capability factor, stronger preference will be given:<br />To sources with pulse width closer to 100 ps."</p>
<p>Experience: NIST will evaluate the extent of the offeror's experience providing similar equipment. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate they have experience delivering the same equipment they are proposing for the current requirement. <br />Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years. In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable.

<p>"The terms and conditions in the solicitation are acceptable to be included in the award document without modification, deletion, or addition."</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>"The terms and conditions in the solicitation are acceptable to be included in the award document with the exception, deletion, or addition of the following:</p>
<p>Offeror shall list exception(s) and rationale for the exception(s)</p>
<p>Note: This procurement is not being conducted under the GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) program or another Government-Wide Area Contract (GWAC). If an offeror submits a quotation based upon an FSS or GWAC contract, the Government will accept the quoted price. However, the terms and conditions stated herein will be included in any resultant Purchase Order, not the terms and conditions of the offeror's FSS or GWAC contract, and the statement required above shall be included in the quotation.</p>
<p>QUOTATION EVALUATION:</p>
<p>Evaluation Factors</p>
<p>Award shall be made to the offeror whose quotation offers the best value to the Government price and other factors considered. The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability 2) Experience, 3) Past Performance, and 4) Price. All non-price factors, when combined, are approximately equal price.</p>
<p>Technical Capability: No prototypes, demonstration models, used or refurbished instruments will be considered. Evaluation of technical capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation. NIST will evaluate whether the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds all minimum requirements. Quotations that do not demonstrate the proposed equipment meets all requirements will not be considered further for award. If an offeror does not indicate whether its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate that their proposed equipment exceeds NIST's requirements.</p>
<p>Stronger Preference:</p>
<p>Under the Technical Capability factor, stronger preference will be given:</p>
<p>The capability to measure particles ranging from about 10 nm to 1000 nm in diameter.<br />Stronger preference will be given to systems that exceed this size range.</p>
<p>Nanoparticle concentrations in our samples may vary between 10 to 108 particles/cm3.<br />Stronger preference will be given to systems that exceed this range of concentrations.</p>
<p><br />Experience: NIST will evaluate the extent of the offeror's experience providing similar equipment. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate they have experience delivering the same equipment they are proposing for the current requirement. <br />Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years. In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable. The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offeror's past performance. The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.</p>

<p>3) Past Performance: The offeror shall provide past performance information regarding relevant contracts over the past five (5) years with Federal, state, or local governments, or commercial customers. If the offeror has no relevant past performance, it may include a statement to that effect in its quotation. The government reserves the right to consider data obtained from sources other than those described by the offeror in its quotation. It is recommended that approximately 3-5 contracts be referenced.</p>
<p>Acceptance of Terms and Conditions: This is an open-market solicitation for equipment as defined herein. The Government intends to award a Purchase Order as a result of this solicitation that will include the clauses set forth herein. The quotation should include one of the following statements:</p>
<p>"The terms and conditions in the solicitation are acceptable to be included in the award document without modification, deletion, or addition."</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>"The terms and conditions in the solicitation are acceptable to be included in the award document with the exception, deletion, or addition of the following:</p>
<p>Offeror shall list exception(s) and rationale for the exception(s)</p>
<p>Note: This procurement is not being conducted under the GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) program or another Government-Wide Area Contract (GWAC). If an offeror submits a quotation based upon an FSS or GWAC contract, the Government will accept the quoted price. However, the terms and conditions stated herein will be included in any resultant Purchase Order, not the terms and conditions of the offeror's FSS or GWAC contract, and the statement required above shall be included in the quotation.</p>
<p>QUOTATION EVALUATION:</p>
<p>Evaluation Factors</p>
<p>Award shall be made to the offeror whose quotation offers the best value to the Government price and other factors considered. The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability 2) Past Performance, and 3) Price. All non-price factors, when combined, are approximately equally important to price.</p>
<p>Technical Capability: No prototypes, demonstration models, used or refurbished instruments will be considered. Evaluation of technical capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation. NIST will evaluate whether the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds all minimum requirements. Quotations that do not demonstrate the proposed equipment meets all requirements will not be considered further for award. If an offeror does not indicate whether its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate that their proposed equipment exceeds NIST's requirements. NIST will give stronger preference to offerors whose quoted equipment exceeds minimum requirement 4.</p>
<p><br />Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years. In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references. The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable. The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offeror's past performance. The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.</p>
<p><br />Price: The Government will evaluate price for reasonableness.</p>
<p>Experience, Past Performance, and Price shall not be evaluated on quotes that are determined technically unacceptable under the Technical Capability Evaluation factor.</p>

<p>&emsp;<br />Statement of Work<br />IRAC Archive Scanning</p>
<p>A. Background Information:<br />The Interdepartment Radio Advisory Committee (IRAC) Secretariat, IRAC Support Branch, Office of Spectrum Management (OSM), National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), Department of Commerce, provides technical and administrative support to the Interdepartment Radio Advisory Committee (IRAC), its Subcommittees and Ad Hoc Groups. The IRAC is the oldest continuing functioning Government advisory committee (Chartered June 1, 1922) and currently functions to advise the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information on telecommunication matters. The IRAC assists the Assistant Secretary in assigning frequencies to U.S. Government radio stations and in developing and executing policies, programs, procedures, and technical criteria pertaining to the allocation, management, and use of the radio spectrum. The IRAC is comprised of 21 representatives from Federal Government Departments and Bureaus. The IRAC itself meets every three weeks. Counting meetings of its subcommittees and its various ad hoc groups, there are IRAC related meetings held at least three times every week. The IRAC Secretariat provides support to all IRAC related meetings by the arrangement and the maintenance of meeting schedules, the processing and distribution of documents on meeting agendas, the drafting of meeting minutes, and the maintenance of a library of all meeting agendas, minutes and agenda item documents. As a part of this support function, NTIA was charged with the responsibility of establishing an archival document storage system whereby IRAC documents could be scanned into a database with the capability of capturing and retrieving the entire content of the documents on a real-time basis. Having one storage system would preclude each Federal Agency represented on the IRAC to maintain a duplicate file. In the past, all documentation was stored on microfilm but a new media was needed due to the shelf life of microfilm, and the fact that it could not be electronically searched. It was agreed that a storage media would be derived to provide a mechanism to electronically search historical documents, and assist in the automation initiative to receive, store, and distribute all meeting materials electronically. At this time, well over a million pages of documents have been scanned, indexed and incorporated in the IRAC Documentation Database (IDD). This included documents from the initiation of the IRAC to the present. The documentation of the IRAC and its subcommittees are scanned into this database regularly to maintain an active updated searchable database. The IRAC plans to have this scanning accomplished on a monthly basis or at least quarterly.<br />B. Purpose and Objectives of the Procurement<br />A follow-on contract is needed for a scanning technician and archivist. It is imperative that the IRAC archive remain up-to-date or the Federal government's spectrum management operations could be greatly impacted if reference documents are not available to be searched and retrieved.<br />C. Contractor Requirements<br />The purpose of this contract is to assist with the tasks regarding the capturing of the IRAC documentation (to include its subcommittees) and scanning them into a retrievable database. The requirements for these tasks are:<br />1. The contractor must have a security clearance up to the SECRET level in order to perform the tasks.<br />2. The contractor must work on-site at the Herbert Hoover Building, Room 1092, 1401 Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC. This is required because of the sensitivity and classification of certain documents. The Government will provide adequate work space for the contractor, including desk, chair, telephone, and computer hardware. The Government will provide access to photocopiers, facsimile machines, and printers necessary to perform the necessary duties.<br />3. Contractor must meet the DOC IT Security Program Policy &amp; Minimum Implementation Standards. (The C&amp;A requirements of CAR 1352.239-73 (clause 73) do not apply, and that a Security Accreditation Package is not required.)<br />4. The contractor must have a good working knowledge of the ZyImage software that is used for the IRAC document database in order to ensure that documents are properly stored in the database.<br />5. The contractor must have a good working knowledge of the Kodak Document Scanner 5500D that is used for this scanning process. The current interface software with the ZyImage software will only work with this scanner. The contractor must know how to perform operator level maintenance and corrective actions on the scanner.<br />6. The contractor must gather all documents to be scanned in sequential order from the IRAC Secretariat and identify and assist the secretariat staff in locating missing documents. <br />7. The contractor must know how to prepare and file the unique bar code identifier that precedes each document to be scanned. This identifier plays a primary role in identifying each record during the search and retrieval process. The records of the (IRAC) and its subcommittees are scanned separately so that these records will be stored and indexed as a unique database.<br />8. The contractor must review each document (Quality Control) after scanning in an electronic format to ensure that each page of the document was scanned and the information contained on the pages are legible. <br />9. The contractor must assist in the preparation of the documentation for transmittal to the Federal Records Center and also be familiar with the National Telecommunication and Information Administration Federal Record Control Schedule.<br />10. The contractor must be familiar with security classification guidelines for the use and storage of classified records.<br />D. Government Responsibilities<br />This contract must be performed at the Government site, Herbert C. Hoover Building, Room 1605, 1401 Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. The Government is to provide adequate work space for the contractor, including desk, chair, telephone, and computer hardware. The Government is to provide access to photocopiers, facsimile machines, and printers necessary to perform the duties detailed in Paragraph C.<br />E. Reporting Requirements and Deliverables<br />The contractor must develop and maintain a progress report log for the completion of assigned tasks. This information shall be available to the Government for review upon request.<br />A status report must accompany each monthly invoice outlining the accomplishments during the past month.<br />Monthly invoices submitted by the contractor shall be coordinated with the designated COTR prior to payment to certify that the service for which the invoice is provided has been completed.<br />F. Program Management and Control Requirements<br />Program oversight will be accomplished by the IRAC Executive Secretary in consultation with the COTR. They will work directly with the contractor to prioritize and schedule the assigned tasks. They will be available to respond to any questions posed by the contractor with respect to scheduling conflicts.<br />G. Inspection and Acceptance Criteria<br />What will be inspected and approved? The Government will inspect and approve the database of IRAC related documents to ensure that a) it is inclusive of all the available documentation, and b) the records are legible. <br />Who will inspect and approve and when will the inspection occur? The IRAC Executive Secretary in consultation with the COTR will be performing the inspection. The inspection will be completed on a monthly basis.<br />What procedures will the Government use? The work of this contractor must also be closely monitored by other management personnel within OSM as well as by the Federal Government Representatives on the IRAC and its Subcommittees/ad hoc groups. Since the IRAC Secretariat has been designated as the depository for the IRAC and its Subcommittees documentation, it will be quite evident by these forums that the contractor is not performing her tasks in accordance with the contract agreements. In addition to the oversight provided by the IRAC, the Government will monitor on a monthly basis the completeness of the incorporation of the IRAC related documents into an electronic media.</p>

The product has been around since 1989 and the US Dept of Commerce has been a client of IDC's Black Book for nearly a decade &amp; uses it extensively in their planning. I believe this product is unique to IDC. ITA reserves the right not to make award(s) if such a decision is determined to be in the best interest of the government. ITA intends to pay one fixed price for this book.</p>
<p>Proposals will be evaluated on the basis of price, and technical capability. Each offeror's proposal shall include information describing its technical approach to meeting the requirements, information, and price.</p>
<p>Offerors should provide the contact information for three references. Greater weight will be given to Commerce Department and U.S. Government staff references.</p>
<p>Please submit proposals by e-mail by 11:00a.m.local time by July 7, 2011.<br />Background: ITA has been using the IDC Worldwide Black Book for nearly a decade and uses it extensively in ITA's planning. This IDC study outlines the IT market taxonomy for IDC's Worldwide Black Book. It includes detailed methodologies for each of the major market segments included in the Black Book along with detailed category definitions. It provides a summary of the Black Book methodology, in which capacity it is intended for use as a handbook for the Black Book. The Worldwide Black Book taxonomy is reviewed annually by a committee of worldwide and regional analysts to determine updates based on current research segmentation and methodology across all international regions. As such, the taxonomy evolves in line with IDC research practices and with the evolution of the industry as new technology sectors are added to the taxonomy over time.</p>

<p>The following clauses are provided in full text:<br />CAR 1352.271-72 Additional Item Requirements (AIRs) - Growth Work (APR 2010)<br /><br />(a) This clause applies to Additional Item Requirements (AIR), also known as growth and emergent work ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Changes - Ship Repair clause or mutually agreed upon by the parties. The contractor shall perform AIR at the labor billing rates designated in the Schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.<br />(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule: (1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance. <br />(2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance. <br />(3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.<br />(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include: <br />(1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging. <br />(2) Non-production labor hours (whether charged directly or indirectly by contractor's accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).<br />(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.<br />(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.<br />(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals: <br />(1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.<br />(2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced. When requested by the Contracting Officer, material quotes shall be provided. <br />(3) Subcontractor estimates, individually broken out and priced along with the actual subcontractor quotes. The requirement to submit subcontractor quotes may be waived if deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer. <br />(4) Material/subcontractor handling fee and the basis for the fee.<br />(g) The contractor shall not be entitled to payment for any hours ordered pursuant to this clause until such time as a written contract modification is executed.<br />(End of clause)<br /><br />FAR clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items (MAY 2011) applies to this acquisition and the following additional FAR clauses cited in the clause at paragraphs (b) and (c) are applicable to this acquisition:</p>

<p><br /><br />BARDA BAA-11-100-SOL-00021<br />Introduction</p>
<p>This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) sets forth research and development areas of interest for the Office of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), a component of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). This BAA is issued under paragraph 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and proposals selected for award are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provision of Public Law 98-369, "The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984" and subsequent amendments.</p>
<p>BARDA is the lead federal agency for the advanced development of medical countermeasures (MCM) to protect the United States against public health emergency threats, including chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear agents, emerging infectious diseases, and pandemic influenza. The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic exemplified the unpredictability and rapidity with which a novel influenza strain can impact the world's population. With a historic effort from both government and industry partners, vaccines were developed and available to the public six months after the initial outbreak. Despite high infection rates, the 2009 H1N1 virus was only mildly pathogenic, with relatively low rates of accompanying morbidity and mortality in the overall population. However, it is possible that future pandemics will feature morbidity and mortality rates comparable with historically more severe pandemics such as 1918, and 1957. The ever-present and ever-evolving threat of pandemic influenza presents a compelling need to optimize available medical countermeasures and develop entirely new modalities for prevention and treatment of influenza disease. Vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics are essential to protect all segments of the civilian population. This BAA will support advanced development activities to improve candidate products and diagnostic tools and incorporate considerations of the challenging lifecycle requirements of these products before and during a pandemic (e.g. shelf life, storage, distribution, and dispensing).</p>
<p>The Pandemic and All Hazard Preparedness Act directs BARDA to promote (i) innovations in technologies that may assist MCM advanced research and development, (ii) research and development of tools, devices, and technologies, and (iii) research to promote strategic initiatives, such as rapid diagnostics, broad spectrum antimicrobials, and vaccine manufacturing technologies. The priorities of the BARDA Influenza Division are closely aligned with the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza (Nov, 2005), the National Pandemic Influenza Implementation Plan (May, 2005), recommendations from the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasure Enterprise Review (Aug, 2010) and the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology report on influenza vaccines manufacturing (Aug, 2010). The HHS Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise Review emphasizes the need to improve medical countermeasure technologies and move towards a "nimble, flexible capacity to produce MCMs rapidly in the face of any attack or threat".</p>
<p>This BAA is open to all responsible sources. Offerors may include single entities or teams from private sector organizations, Government laboratories, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), and academic institutions.</p>

<p>The purpose of this BAA is to solicit proposals that focus on one or more of the following solicited areas of interest as listed here and further described in Part I of this announcement.</p>
<p>Development Areas of Interest:<br />&bull; Personal Protective Equipment and Full-Featured Continuous Ventilators for Influenza Infection &amp; All-Hazards<br />&bull; Clinical Influenza Test Systems and Diagnostic Tools</p>
<p>Given the future availability of funds, this BAA may be expanded to incorporate development of other medical countermeasure products. Any such changes would be incorporated as BAA Amendments, and would be posted on http://www.fbo.gov.</p>
<p>Development and technical objectives are described in Part II, and efforts proposed by Offerors may include such activities as Non-Clinical Product Development, Manufacturing Process Development, Formulation, and Clinical Evaluation.</p>
<p>Offerors must identify in their Quad Chart and White Paper the current Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of their medical countermeasure product. See Attachment 1: Technology Readiness Level (TRL) CriteriaAttachment 1: Technology Readiness Level (TRL) Criteria. Two TRL criteria are provided to evaluate diagnostics products and to provide Offerors greater insight into the complexities of the diagnostics development process. Either diagnostics TRL criteria document may be used to assess product maturity. Please note that all activities within a TRL level (or sublevel) must be completed to have achieved that TRL status.</p>
<p>The BAA will be conducted in two stages:</p>
<p>In Stage 1, Offerors shall submit a Quad Chart and White Paper summarizing the proposed project. All Quad Charts and White Papers must be prepared in accordance with the instructions contained in Part IV. Brochures or other descriptions of general organizational or individual capabilities will not be accepted. Electronic acknowledgement of receipt of white papers will be made within one week. For Stage 1 there are four submission deadlines: July 15, 2011, October 14, 2011 January 13, 2012 and April 13, 2012. Decision letters will be sent to Offerors within 90 days of submission or within 90 days after the submission deadline.</p>
<p>In Stage 2, Offerors receiving a favorable evaluation will be asked to prepare a Full Proposal and submit to BARDA within 45 days depending on time and funding constraints. Instructions for completing the Full Proposal are found in Part IV of this announcement. A request to submit a Full Proposal does not assure an award. The Government intends to make an award decision within 120 days after submission of Full Proposals.</p>
<p>The success of a product development program requires a relentless focus on the desired characteristics of the resulting medical countermeasure product. During Stage 2, in addition to the Full Proposal, Offerors are requested to provide a Target Product Profile. A template for a Target Product Profile is included in Attachment 1 as a tool for Offerors to describe the objectives of their advanced research and development activities, and to update dynamically as supporting data about their product is obtained. All Offerors are encouraged to submit a Target Product Profile for the proposed medical countermeasure, with a particular focus on elements 1-4. For those products for which the Target Product Profile format is not applicable, appropriate equivalent information regarding the desired outcome of the proposed development activities should be provided.</p>
<p>There are no specified funding limitations identified for proposals submitted under this BAA. The budget shall be commensurate with the nature and complexity of the proposed activities; however, contract awards and level of funding may be impacted by the availability of Congressional annual and/or supplemental appropriations. The costs of preparing responses to this BAA are not considered an allowable direct charge on any resultant award.</p>
<p>Offerors contemplating submitting Quad Charts, White Papers, and Full Proposals are strongly encouraged to contact the appropriate technical Point of Contact (POC) at BARDA (e-mail addresses are provided in Part I of this announcement). Offerors are advised that only a Contracting Officer may obligate the Government to any agreement involving expenditure of Government funds. Once a white paper or full proposal has been submitted, all communications must be conducted through the BARDA Contracting Officer (The Office of Acquisitions Management, Contract &amp; Grants).</p>
<p>The costs of preparing responses to this BAA are not considered allowable direct charges on any resultant award.</p>
<p>Quad Chart and White Papers and/or Full Proposals WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED after 3:00 PM (Eastern Standard Time) on September 13, 2011.</p>
<p>In accordance with federal statutes, regulations, and HHS policies, no person on grounds of race, color, age, sex, national origin, or disability shall be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving financial assistance from the HHS.</p>
<p>BARDA reserves the right to fund all, some, or none of the proposals submitted. While award is anticipated to occur according to the stated schedule, Offerors that are not responsive to BARDA requests for information in a timely manner, will not be considered for an award.</p>
<p>BARDA reserves the right to award the contract instrument best suited to the nature of the development activities proposed and may award any appropriate contract type under the Federal Acquisition Regulation. BARDA may also elect to make awards in the form of grants and cooperative agreements, with the possibility of awarding Other Transactions (OT) agreements in the future as appropriate, as authorized for BARDA under the Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness Act (2006).</p>
<p>Multiple awards at various funding levels, base periods, and options are anticipated and are dependent upon the proposals' scientific and technical merits, how well the proposals fit BARDA's areas of interest, and available funding.</p>
<p>Special instructions will be advertised via the BAA as they become apparent. These additional instructions are tailored to specific topic areas and may have unique submittal dates. The information requested in these instructions should be used along with Part IV of the BAA to format and prepare the Technical and Business Proposals.</p>
<p>Anticipated funding for the program (not per contract or award) may range from $15-75M dollars subject to Congressional appropriations. This funding profile is an estimate only and does not represent a contractual obligation for funding. All funding is subject to change due to government discretion and availability.</p>

<p>POST EMPLOYMENT CONFLICT OF INTEREST: There are certain post employment restrictions on former federal officers and employees, including special government employees (Section 207 of Title 18, U.S.C.). If a prospective Offeror believes a conflict of interest may exist, the situation should be emailed to this address FLU BAA@hhs.gov, prior to expending time and effort in preparing a proposal. The appropriate BARDA personnel will discuss with any conflict of interest with prospective Offeror.</p>
<p>UNSUCCESSFUL PROPOSAL DISPOSITION: Unless noted in an Offeror's proposal to the contrary, unsuccessful full proposals will be retained for six (6) months from declination and then properly destroyed.<br /><br />Part V: Proposal Evaluation<br />A. Evaluation Criteria<br />The selection of one or more sources for award will be based on an evaluation of each Offeror's Quad Chart and White Paper and Full Proposal. The Quad Chart and White Paper and Full Proposal will be evaluated by a peer or scientific review process and will be evaluated based on the following criteria that are listed in descending order of importance pursuant to FAR 35.016. The sub-criteria listed under a particular criterion are of equal importance to each other.</p>
<p>a. Program relevance<br />1. Medical countermeasures including medical devices that align with the objectives outlined in the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza, the HHS Pandemic Influenza Implementation Plan, and other federal government strategy documents <br />2. Medical countermeasures that address the priorities outlined in Part I: Research Areas of Interest.</p>
<p>b. The overall scientific and technical merits of the proposal<br />1. The degree of innovation and potential to offer a revolutionary increase in capability or a significant reduction in cost commensurate with the potential risks of the innovative approach.<br />2. The soundness, feasibility, and validity of the proposed plans, methods, techniques, and procedures of the technical proposal.<br />3. The Offeror's understanding of the scope and the technical effort needed to address it.<br />4. The reasonableness of the proposed schedule. <br />5. The Offeror's understanding of the statutory and regulatory requirements..<br />6. Ownership of Intellectual Property.</p>
<p>c. The Offeror's capabilities, related experience, and past performance, including the qualifications, capabilities, and experiences of the proposed key personnel <br />1. The quality of technical personnel proposed.<br />2. The Offeror's experience in relevant efforts with similar resources.<br />3. The ability to manage the proposed effort, and to avoid interference with other current projects.</p>
<p>d. Cost realism and reasonableness. Each price/cost response will be reviewed for price/cost realism, reasonableness, and overall best value to the government. Members of the review team may presume that the technical approach provided by the Offeror serves as a rationale for the labor mix and labor hours used.</p>
<p>e. For contract awards to be made to large businesses, the socio-economic merits of each proposal will be evaluated, but not scored, based on the extent of the Offeror's commitment in providing meaningful subcontracting opportunities for small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, woman-owned businesses, service disabled veteran-owned small businesses, Hub-zone small business concerns, historically black colleges and universities, and minority institutions.</p>
<p>f. For contracts, preference for Offerors providing U.S. based jobs in the technical and /or administrative activities needed to accomplish milestone activities associated with product development will be afforded if the assessment on other criteria is equal.</p>
<p>The final evaluation will be based on an assessment of the overall best value to the government based on these criteria. Awards, if any, will be made based on proposal evaluation, funds availability, and other programmatic considerations. Award is also dependent upon demonstration by the applicant that they have adequately addressed the following requirements:</p>
<p>a. Research involving Human Subjects/Anatomical Substances (if proposed).<br />b. Research involving Animals (if proposed).<br />c. Evidence of GLP Compliance (if appropriate).<br />d.

Use of Select Agents (if appropriate)<br />h. All required Representations and Certifications are completed and on file.</p>
<p>The Quad Chart, White Paper and Full Proposal will be evaluated and categorized as follows:</p>
<p>CATEGORY I: Well conceived, scientifically, and technically sound proposals important to program goals and objectives. Proposals in CATEGORY I need not be perfect; minor revisions may be addressed during negotiations. Proposals in CATEGORY I are recommended for acceptance subject to government needs and funds availability.</p>
<p>CATEGORY II: Scientifically sound proposals important to program goals and objectives that require significant revision in order to be appropriate for acceptance subject to funds availability. CATEGORY II proposals have a lower priority than CATEGORY I.</p>
<p>CATEGORY III: Proposals that are either not technically sound or do not meet program goals and objectives. CATEGORY III proposals have the lowest priority and will be rejected.</p>
<p>Offerors selected for negotiations may be subject to inspections of their facilities and Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) capabilities. The decision to inspect specific facilities will be made by the Project Officer in coordination with the Contracting Officer. If inspections are performed during the negotiations, the results of the inspection will be considered in final selection for award of a contract. Offerors, including proposed subcontractors, will be requested to make all non-proprietary records, including previous regulatory inspection records, and staff available in response to a pre-award site visit or audit by BARDA or its designee. Pre-award site visits may be made with short notice. Offerors are expected to guarantee the availability of key staff or other staff determined by the Government as essential for purposes of this site visit.</p>

Break down the program work scope into finite pieces that can be assigned to a responsible person or organization for control of technical, schedule, and cost objectives. <br />3. Integrate program work scope, schedule, and cost objectives into a performance measurement baseline plan against which accomplishments may be measured. Control changes to the baseline. <br />4. Use actual cost incurred and recorded in accomplishing the work performed. <br />5. Objectively assess accomplishments at the work performance level. <br />6. Analyze significant variances from the plan, forecast impacts, and prepare an estimate at completion based on performance to date and work to be performed. <br />7. Use Performance Based information in the company's management processes.</p>
<p>In addition, within the Technical Volume of the Full Proposal, the Offeror(s) shall as stated in the BAA develop a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) to an appropriate level and a WBS dictionary which lists and defines the WBS elements that also is inclusive of the applicable EVM requirements. <br />Contractors required to provide Earned Value Management to their project can obtain additional instruction from the 7 Principles of EVM Intent Guide.</p>

<p>GLOSSARY OF EVM TERMS<br />Actual Cost of Work Performed (ACWP) The costs actually applied and recorded in accomplishing the work performed within a specified period.<br /><br />Baseline (See Performance Measurement Baseline).<br /><br />Budget at Completion (BAC) The sum of all budgets (BCWS) allocated to the contract. Synonymous with the term Performance Measurement Baseline.<br /><br />Budgeted Cost for Work Performed (BCWP) The sum of the budgets for completed Work Packages and completed portions of open Work Packages, plus the appropriate portion of the budgets for level of effort and apportioned effort (Also see Earned Value). <br />Control Account A management control point at which actual costs can be accumulated and compared to budgeted cost for work performed. A control account is a natural control point for cost/schedule planning and control since it represents the work assigned to one responsible organizational element on one contract work breakdown structure (CWBS) element.<br /><br />Control Account Manager (CAM) A member of a functional organization responsible for task performance detailed in a Control Account and for managing the resources authorized to accomplish the tasks.<br /><br />Control Account Plan (CAP) Report A CAP report is a time phased report which reflects all the work and effort to be performed in a control account. The CAP report will reflect the hours and dollars by element of cost (labor, subcontract, ODC, etc).</p>
<p>Contract Performance Report (CPR) The monthly report submitted to the customer showing the current, cumulative and at completion status, the performance measurement baseline, manpower loading, and a narrative explanation of significant program variances. <br /><br />Contract Target Cost The dollar value (excluding fee or profit) negotiated in the original contract plus the cumulative cost (excluding fee or profit) applicable to all definitized changes to the contract. It consists of the estimated cost negotiated for a cost plus fixed fee contract and the definitized target cost for an incentive contract. The contract target cost does not include the value of authorized/un-negotiated work, and is thus equal to the contract budget base only when all authorized work has been negotiated/definitized.<br /><br />Earned Value See Budgeted Cost for Work Performed (BCWP)<br /><br />Earned Value Management System (EVMS) A project management system utilized for measuring project progress in an objective manner. Combines measurements of scope, schedule, and cost in a single integrated system.</p>
<p>Estimate at Completion (EAC) A value (expressed in dollars and/or hours) developed to represent a realistic appraisal of the final cost of tasks when accomplished. It's the sum of direct &amp; indirect costs to date plus the estimate of costs for all authorized Work remaining. The EAC = ACWP + the Estimate-to-Complete.<br /><br />Estimate to Completion (ETC) A value (expressed in dollar and/or hours) developed to represent a realistic appraisal of the cost of the work still required to be accomplished in completing a task.<br /><br />Integrated Master Schedule (IMS) The IMS expands the IMP to the work planning level. It defines the tasks, their durations, milestones, milestone dates which relate to the IMP completion criteria, and interdependencies required to complete the program. The IMP and IMS are used to track and execute the program.<br /><br />Negotiated Contract Target Cost The estimated cost negotiated in a Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF), Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF), Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) or Fixed Price Incentive Fee (FPIF) contract.</p>
<p>Performance Measurement <br />Baseline (PMB) The time-phased budget plan against which contract performance is measured. It is formed by the budgets assigned to scheduled Control Accounts and the allocation of overhead costs. For future effort, not planned to the Control Account level, the performance measurement baseline also includes budgets assigned to higher level WBS elements, and undistributed budgets. It equals the total assigned budget less management reserve.<br /><br />Risk Register Is a tool commonly used in project planning and organizational risk assessments. It is often referred to as a Risk Log. It is used for identifying, analyzing and managing risks. <br /><br />Variance Analysis Report (VAR) The internal report completed by the Control Account Manager and submitted, through the Intermediate Manager, to the program manager for those Control Accounts which have variances in excess of established thresholds.</p>
<p>Work Authorization Document (WAD) A form used to formally authorize and budget work to the Control Account Manager. This document must include, as a minimum, the Control Account number, Statement of Work, scheduled start and finish dates, budget, and the identity of the CAM. It must be approved by Intermediate Manager, and be agreed to by the Control Account Manager.</p>

Offers will be evaluated to determine compliance with all requirements of the solicitation, including any attachments and exhibits.  The evaluation criteria will be applied to all offers in the same manner.  Each proposal will be evaluated strictly in accordance with its content and the Government will not assume that performance will include areas not specified in the offeror's proposal.<br><br>PART I:  TECHNICAL EVALUATION.  <br><br>Evaluation of technical capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation.  Technical will be evaluated to determine if the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed service meets or exceeds all requirements.  Quotations that do not demonstrate the proposed service meets all requirements will not be considered further for award.<br><br>PART II:  PAST PERFORMANCE. <br><br>The offeror's performance will be rated in terms of performance risk.  A performance risk rating (low, moderate, high or neutral) will be assigned dependent upon the evaluators' assessment of the level of confidence in the offeror's performance record.  In ranking offerors in the same performance category below, an offeror with past performance  in performing the same or similar services may  be ranked as a lower risk compared to an offeror with no or hardly any experience in performing services.  Past Performance will be evaluated based on assessments of the offeror's performance under current and prior contracts for the last three years.  The information which will be used for evaluation will be obtained from those presented in the Offeror's past performance documentation, the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) http://www.cpars.csd.disa.mil/cparsmain.htm, and any other sources. The Government may reject a proposal if it is found that any information that has a negative impact on the offeror's past performance record has been deleted, misrepresented, or withheld.  Past performance surveys should be based upon the performance of like services to those in this solicitation. <br><br>-High Risk - Significant doubt exists that the offeror will satisfactorily perform the services solicited, based on a preponderance of unsatisfactory performance records,  or the offeror's record of unsuccessful performance of past and current contract in fulfilling requirements similar to the size, type,  and complexity of the services solicited.  The offeror has consistently not met work schedules and other obligations, has defaulted on at least one contract within the past three years, or has chronically failed to meet contract terms.<br><br>-Medium Risk - Some doubt exists based on limited instances of poor performance, especially in contracts similar in size, type  and complexity of the services solicited.  The offeror meets work schedules and specified services most of the time, met contract terms without failure or resolved issues immediately, and has not been defaulted on any contract within the past three years.<br><br>-Low Risk - Little doubt exists, based on the preponderance of the offeror's good, if not excellent, past and current records of contract performance, especially in large contracts similar to the size, type, and complexity of the services solicited.  The offeror consistently meets work schedules, provides specified services, meets contract terms without failure, and has not been defaulted on any contract within the past three years. <br><br>Neutral Risk - No relevant past performance information is available or has been received by the Government..<br><br>PART III:  PRICE.    Price will be evaluated separately from the technical, past performance and the experience factors and will be evaluated for fairness and reasonability in terms of:<br><br>A.  That the prices are consistent with and reflect the proposed requirement.<br><br>B.  Offerors are cautioned that an unrealistically low price, or unbalanced pricing of line items, as proposed initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal, either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the required services, or he has made an imprudent offer.<br><br>C.  All vendors' prices must be deemed to be fair and reasonable to qualify for award.<br><br>PART IV:  EXPERIENCE.<br><br>The offeror shall demonstrate the extent to which it has recently repaired, sharpened, and maintained medical instruments.<br><br><br>52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (Apr 2011)<br><br>(End of clauses)<br><br><br><br><br>Full text of provisions and clauses may be accessed electronically at the following address: http://www.arnet.gov/far.  <br><br> Questions concerning this acquisition may be address to rita.y.ware@amedd.army.mil.

<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Additional clauses/provisions in full text)<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br />Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5427, or at the following address: <br />MEDIUM RANGE SURVEILLANCE (MRS)<br />USCG/CASA<br />AVIATION LOGISTICS CENTER (ALC)<br />ELIZABETH CITY, NC 27909</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC><p>See the attached solicitation, #FA4890-11-T-0005, submitted for requests for quotes. The solicitation document, and incorpoarted provisions and clauses, are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular, Fac 2005-52, Effective 31 May 2011. The attached solicitation lists the contract line item numbers (CLINs), items, quantities, units of measure, description, dates and places of delivery and acceptance, and FOB point.<br /><br />Question 1: What are the components for the circuit cards?<br />Answer 1: The customer stated the data for these 2 boards was not provided to a component level; the customer stated that for this quote we provided 2 mfg p/n's that refer to a ready made board.<br /><br />Question 2: Any chance your end user can confirm these are Digital Equipment Company (DEC) manufactured items that are most likely only available as used or refurbished?<br />Answer 2: New or refurbished is ok as it is unlikely there are still new boards out there! The answer to his question is yes, they were DEC manufactured, and<br />refurbished is ok with the important part of the order being that the boards must have 'bit3' on the boards not 'sbs'...very important. The boards marked with sbs are no good to us. They must be marked as bit3.</p>
<p>Question 3: Are there technical documents available for this solicitation? <br />Answer 3: The only technical data is what is already in the solicitation. The boards required were manufactured many years ago. Its really a moot point as we have no further technical data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Question 4: We are assuming these components are obsolete and not being supported by the OEM or an approved source. Is this the case with this SOL? Since there is little or no documentation, can there be provided an A or F PCB to utilize in our reverse engineering process to replicate these components?<br />Answer 4: Yes they can assume the components are obsolete and not being supported by the OEM or an approved source. Yes, this is the case with the SOL. We cannot provide an A or F PCB as we have no further technical data other than what was provided.</p>

If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<p>Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-220) requires that when Federal agencies develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and information technology (EIT), they must ensure that it is accessible to people with disabilities. Federal employees and members of the public who have disabilities must have equal access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that enjoyed by non-disabled Federal employees and members of the public.</p>
<p>All EIT deliverables within this work statement shall comply with the applicable technical and functional performance criteria of Section 508 unless exempt. Specifically, the following applicable standards have been identified:</p>
<p>36 CFR 1194.21 - Software Applications and Operating Systems, applies to all EIT software applications and operating systems procured or developed under this work statement including but not limited to GOTS and COTS software.

<p>36 CFR 1194.2(b) - (COTS/GOTS products), When procuring a product, each agency shall procure products which comply with the provisions in this part when such products are available in the commercial marketplace or when such products are developed in response to a Government solicitation. Agencies cannot claim a product as a whole is not commercially available because no product in the marketplace meets all the standards. If products are commercially available that meet some but not all of the standards, the agency must procure the product that best meets the standards.</p>
<p>When applying this standard, all procurements of EIT shall have documentation of market research that identify a list of products or services that first meet the agency business needs, and from that list of products or services, an analysis that the selected product met more of the accessibility requirements than the non-selected products as required by FAR 39.2.

The Contracting Officer will provide the Contractor with a written explanation to support any request to remove an employee.</p>
<p>Conflict of Interest. <br />The Contractor shall not employ any person who is an employee of the United States Government if that employment would, or would appear to cause a conflict of interest.</p>

<p>Notice For Filing Agency Protests<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to: (1) Incorporate additional information for the following three focus areas for FY12; and (2) Changing the FY12 recommended dates for white papers for these three topic areas.
<p>(1) Insert the following three topic areas under I. Funding Opportunity Description:</p>
<p><strong>FY 12 Focus Areas:<br /><br />User-Defined Force Presentations:</strong> The Air Force needs a powerful and agile method for building new visualization constructs without the long lead time of traditional software development; particularly in cases where non-geospatially based data (data not containing information mapping it to the surface of the Earth), and geospatial data that is better visualized non-geospatially, is becoming more important to the warfighter. The process of traditional application development is slow and laborious, making it ineffective at responding to the pace of technology, imagination, and most importantly, the enemy's evolving modes of warfare. This work will provide a composable visualization capability akin to the Air, Space, and Cyber User Defined Operational Picture (ASC-UDOP), and will also require leveraging of the JView graphical tool set. The specific objectives are to 1) define and develop new rendering constructs that can be instantiated at run-time by operators through a graphical user interface (GUI), and to 2) create ways that allow a user to define components within an application to interact with one another based on event triggers, both those originating from the user and from changes in system state, and to do so dynamically at execution time.<br /><br />White papers for this topic will be due by 13 July 2011. Awards will not exceed 24 months with dollar amounts ranging from $350,000-$1,000,000.</p>
<p><strong>Synchronized Mission Optimization and Assembly Service:</strong> This focus area seeks novel research and development efforts that will result in a prototype capability that will utilize search-optimization algorithms to automatically assemble missions optimized against warfighter defined needs, constraints, and rules of engagement that are coordinated and synchronized across USAF mission elements (air, space, etc.) into unities of effort based on available resources. It will result in a command and control capability that will be able to handle increases in complexity, mitigate uncertainty and increase ops tempo.<br /><br />The Government is anticipating, but not mandating, technical solutions in three main components for this effort. The first of these components will be a dynamic constraint space that will represent asset limitations, warfighter defined needs, priorities and rules of engagement. Every scenario that mission planners encounter is unique. Furthermore, it is typical for conditions to change after task execution has commenced thereby necessitating a change to the constraint space. As a result, the constraints that shape the mission assembly process are complicated, context-sensitive, and change chaotically/asynchronously. In order to truly represent the limitations and boundaries that shape mission and task planning the constraint space will need to be a dynamic, living entity. The second of these components will be the optimization capability that will be used along with the constraint space to build missions that are coordinated, optimized and synchronized across the USAF mission elements. Each optimization approach that has been developed thus far has strengths and weaknesses. Therefore, it is likely that the strongest performing optimization approach will be a hybrid that incorporates as many of the strengths and as few of the short comings of existing approaches as possible. The third component involves how the resultant overall capability will fit into the bigger picture. Bidders should be conscious of our increasing focus on service oriented architectures, and the need to leverage the Cornerstone plan representation and services. Offers should demonstrate an understanding of service development and, to the extent reasonable and possible, propose deliverables that are readily deployed as services (i.e., discoverable, well-defined, self-contained modules that are independent of state or context of other services). <br /><br />White papers for this topic will be due by 13 Jul 2011. Awards will not exceed 36 months. Individual awards will normally range between $100K to $1.0M per year.</p>
<p><strong>Experience Based Adaptive Replanning:</strong> Planning for military operations is notoriously difficult; initial plans rarely survive first contact with the enemy. The Air Force requires technologies that will enable commanders to continuously monitor and adjust plans during their execution as the situation evolves and more relevant and timely information becomes available. To achieve these objectives, we require methods of determining that the executing plan is deviating from its expected performance, establishing deviation thresholds upon which replanning actions should be undertaken, and performing rapid adaptive replanning as necessary to reduce the differential between current state and some desired outcome. Planning under this program is viewed as a sequential decision-making process that iteratively modifies states in a state space. Because we are measuring the current world state, this lends itself towards framing it as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). A MDP is represented as a 4-tuple (S, A, T, R), where: S is a set of state variables, A is a set of actions, T is a transition function, and R is the reward function. The state variables comprising S are a set of features representing the world state in which the plan is being executed.<br /><br />The two specific objectives of this focus area are 1) to develop a method of measuring the distance between the state variables and between two or more world states. This is critical for determining whether the plan is going as expected, or deviating from expected performance. 2) to develop a methodology for establishing thresholds for adaptive replanning. Given a method for measuring the deviations in actual plan performance against expected plan performance, the challenge then becomes determining how much of a deviation should be allowed before replanning takes place. This work will research, implement, analyze and compare various methods for achieving these objectives utilizing the Air Force Research Laboratory's Distributed Episodic Exploratory Planning research platform.<br /><br />White papers for this topic will be due by: 1 Aug 2011. Awards will not exceed 24 months with dollar amounts ranging from $200,000-$300,000.</p>

<p>FEDERAL AGENCY NAME: Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, AFRL - Rome Research Site, AFRL/Information Directorate, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY, 13441-4514</p>
<p>TITLE: Computing Architecture Technologies</p>
<p>ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial announcement</p>
<p>FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA #09-03 - RIKA</p>
<p>CFDA Number: 12.800</p>
<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The Information Directorate, Computing Technology Applications Branch of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Rome Research Site, is soliciting white papers under this announcement for innovative technologies to explore and develop computer architectures with greater capacity, sophistication and assurance for addressing dynamic mission objectives under constraints imposed by Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), trusted/secure systems and performance requirement driven layered information processing battlefield networks. Additional innovative technology developments are sought for technologies that will enable the development of and affordable acquisition of large-scale, complex, software-intensive systems through the development of tools, techniques, standards, and technologies.</p>
<p>Of particular interest are technologies that support architectures for high assurance, trusted/secure architectures, increased computational sophistication, more complex system functionality with improved quality, dramatic improvements in the performance/cost of systems, embedded processing and high productivity computing. Also of interest are technologies that can reduce warfighter decision latencies/response time, decrease system costs and system development times, automate the labor-intensive/error-prone and costly aspects of system software development, improved reliability, longevity, and useability of new and legacy military computing systems.</p>
<p>The overall objective of this BAA is to develop, integrate, and demonstrate computing architecture technologies and applications. This effort will investigate the research, application and/or development of computing architecture technologies, products and standards as they relate to the following technical areas: (1) Development of appropriate information technology to enhance the processing capabilities of current and future Air Force C4I systems: This area encompasses all information processing technology both hardware and software that could potentially contribute to enhancing the functionality, performance, reliability, longevity, scalability and usability of legacy or planned Air Force C4I processing systems. Examples of hardware technologies include multi-core processing architectures with emphasis on hardware support for semantic operations, power reducing/power management/power aware processing architectures, high assurance/trusted/secure processing architectures, high productivity computing systems, self-aware computing systems, data storage, performance optimization visualization tools, mobile and wireless networks and technologies necessary to achieve exa-scale computing. Examples of software technologies include High Performance Computing (HPC) programming languages both new and existing, data retrieval/mining, data management, data delivery, software/system monitors, publish/subscribe mechanisms, decision making techniques, distributed databases, static and dynamic runtime optimization and resource management. (2) Multiple Independent Levels of Security (MILS): This area consists of research into the implications of state-of-the-art commercially available processor architectures (including multi-core, GPU's, FPGA's, etc.) and development of solutions for associated security issues to alleviate the impact on the Separation Kernels that are being developed by the real-time operating system vendors for use in environments requiring high assurance. Advance the state of the art through research and development of high assurance middleware technologies for insertion in mission critical embedded systems in order to enhance system interoperability and capability to support cross domain solutions that will enable delivery of superior and timely information to the warfighter. Develop protection profiles according to the Common Criteria for middleware security components in the Multiple Independent Levels of Security/Safety architecture. (3) Software Producibility/Software Intensive Systems: Software is a prime enabler of complex weapons systems and command and control infrastructure, yet it is the least well understood and the most problematic element of large-scale systems. Software project failures dominated by unmet requirements and cost and schedule overruns abound, in large part due to little underlying science, a minimal engineering knowledge base and a lack of understanding of the physics of software. The complexity of today's system lies in greater than 10 to the 5th power requirements, greater than 10 to the 7th power lines of code, thousands or more component interactions, greater than 30 year product life cycles and stringent certification standards. Technologies, methodologies, techniques, and tools to specify, design, build, verify and test software that will enable the development and affordable, timely, and predictable acquisition of complex, software-intensive systems is being sought. Areas of interest include: software and systems composability with guaranteed system interoperability for provably trusted components and systems; model-based development for predictable software attributes with provably correct code generation and automatic software and system analysis; dynamic, scalable and adaptive software debugging; software mechanisms to fully exploit emerging technology, such as multi-core, in producing new software or modernizing legacy systems; mechanisms to fight through software failures; technology that will increase our understanding of software; and the development of an infrastructure for software-intensive systems modeled after the Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification Guideline DO-178B. (4) Formal architectures for the development of verifiably secure systems: This area includes the development of formal, architectural approaches for the design and development of secure systems. The principle research in this area should study powerful, new notions and related formal methods to underlie the approach, including appropriate forms of composition, model transformation, refinement, and general characterizations of security properties. This research must include the demonstration of the feasibility of the approach, and the development of a proof of concept. (5) High Assurance/Trusted Computing Architectures: The objective of this topic is to investigate the necessary building blocks for high assurance computing environments (environments where compelling evidence is supplied to determine a high level of trustworthiness), including both the underlying hardware and software to support it. Areas of interest include, but are not limited to: (a) the problems and challenges with current processor designs for trustworthiness and their solutions; (b) the problems and challenges with current computer architectures for trustworthiness and solutions to them; (c) the Operating System level constructs, objects and functions that must be provided to complement the hardware to enable a trustworthy computing base; (d) the state of the art software-based assurance designs, methodologies or concepts which are better suited for implementation in hardware than software. This area is also interested in research and development for increasing the level of trustworthiness of integrated circuit designs, commodity integrated circuits and currently available systems as a whole. Finally, this area is also interested in research in the implications of state-of-the-art commercially available processor architectures (including multi-core, GPUs, FPGAs, etc.) and specially designed processor architectures in support of Separation Kernels and other secure micro-kernels being developed by real-time operating system vendors for use in environments requiring high assurances, develop solutions for such implications, and also research and develop supporting software, e.g. high assurance middleware technologies, in order to enhance system interoperability and capability to support cross domain solutions that will enable delivery of trustworthy, superior and timely information.</p>

<p><br />V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- Including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology. The technical concepts should be clearly defined and developed. The technical approach must be sufficiently detailed to support the proposed concepts and technical claims. (2) Offeror's Capabilities and Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, to establish that the offeror has credible capability and experience to complete the proposed work. (3) Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any) to evaluate whether the costs are aligned with the proposed work plan. No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.</p>
<p>3. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS. Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use. Please note that use of the JIFFY or TFIMS application requires customers outside of the .mil domain to purchase an approved External Certificate Authority certificate to facilitate a secured log on process. It is necessary to obtain an ECA certificate BEFORE obtaining a JIFFY or TFIMS user account. Additional information on obtaining an ECA is available at: http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html .</p>

<p>This BAA is comprised of the following focus areas of which an offeror may respond to one or more areas:</p>
<p>1.0 REASONING AND LEARNING</p>
<p>Most automated reasoning and learning techniques rely heavily on well-defined models of the domain of interest. Development of these models is often a manual process requiring input from both experts and knowledge engineers to ensure the model is both expressive and functional. We seek new methods for building and extending models from data and providing a mapping of new information to existing models.</p>
<p>1.1 Targeted Perception</p>
<p>With the large amount of data available from a wide range of sources it is infeasible to map all collected information to concepts that have been modeled in a structured format. Because domain models often contain concepts that are fixed, new information must be mapped to these concepts to be used for reasoning. Additionally, there may be constraints on resources, such as limited collection windows or storage limits that require targeted collection of information that would best support the goals of the reasoning process. The intent is to support collection, refinement, storage and presentation of information in a form that supports reasoning over a model of a domain. Challenges include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>&bull; Extracting and retrieving information that is relevant to provided models.</p>
<p>&bull; Mapping extracted concepts to existing knowledge structures. Tracking the state of concepts over time.</p>
<p>&bull; Generalizing concepts, relations and instances.</p>
<p>&bull; Satisficing of information collection under dynamic constraints</p>
<p>We seek new algorithms for information extraction, mapping and generalization driven by the models provided to the system.</p>
<p>1.2 Model Elicitation</p>
<p>Domain models are often developed by an expert or community of interest but will not necessarily be sufficient for all tasks in that domain. It's likely that information will exist that can not be mapped to defined concepts. Additionally, the domain itself may change over time and require constant updates. Small changes to a model can often have serious impact on the reasoning process. Models can not be exhaustive and, as a result, they could potentially lack the necessary information to be sufficiently expressive. Challenges include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>&bull; Creating and evolving models from iterative inputs.</p>
<p>&bull; Validating and verifying models based on expert review, user input, and data confirmation.</p>
<p>&bull; Representing uncertainty. A distinction should be made between uncertainty about the correctness of the values, and uncertainty regarding the correctness of the model itself.</p>
<p>&bull; Detecting and negotiating inconsistencies, to allow for differing values within the same model and allowing for intentional inconsistency.</p>
<p>&bull; Ensuring changes to a model do not invalidate past assertions.</p>
<p>&bull; Providing clear and concise explanations of the effects of changes to the structure of the model.</p>
<p>We seek algorithms for mixed-initiative development, manipulation, and maintenance of computational models to support reasoning. These technologies will aid in the discovery of the structure and parameters of new or incomplete models. In addition to providing support for uncertainty and inconsistency, solutions should include support for describing rationale, provenance, and trust.</p>
<p>2.0 COMPREHENSION</p>
<p>Comprehension technologies seek to develop capabilities for quantitative evaluation of events that enhance a decision maker's ability to judge, appraise, and determine the relevance of emerging situations.</p>
<p>2.1 Link and Group Discovery (LGD)<br /><br />This area is focused on techniques for analyzing large collections of data to discover valuable knowledge that may be present as hidden patterns or links among seemingly unrelated items. LGD will discover the hidden structure of organizations, relate groups, identify fraudulent behavior, model group activity, connect bits of information into patterns that can be evaluated and analyzed, learn what patterns discriminate between legitimate and suspicious behavior, and provide early detection of emerging threats. Specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to the following areas:</p>
<p>2.1.1 Dynamic Networks Over Time</p>
<p>Most networks of entities and relationships change over time. Computers connect and disconnect from the internet. Web pages and hyperlinks appear and disappear from the worldwide web. People enter and leave social networks. Leaders emerge and then disappear. Many approaches have been developed to detect patterns in static snapshots of these networks, but discovering patterns in the dynamics of these networks can provide new understanding of how they evolve and new ways to categorize networks based on their dynamics.</p>
<p>There is growing evidence that networks influence both individual and collective group activity. Networks play a key role in determining how information is disseminated and how organizations evolve (e.g., how new members are recruited and how they leave). Additionally, these networks have a significant impact on the choices an individual makes. These observations apply not only to social, but also to geospatial, information and technological networks. Despite growing interest in social network analysis (SNA) and related fields, an understanding of how these networks influence individuals and groups is still very limited. The objective of this technology area is to research and develop:</p>
<p>- Methods for combining the effects of multiple, heterogeneous networks within a single model as well as mathematical methods and formalisms for modeling dynamic networks and their influence on the individual and group dynamics.</p>
<p>- Methods for combining different sources of evidence, how to include spatio-temporal data, and how the community structure changes over time.</p>
<p>- Enhanced techniques for social network modeling beyond static models. Develop techniques capable of handling dynamic models that account for relationships that drift over time and tractable to learn such models from data, even as the number of entities gets large.</p>
<p>- Metrics to assess and identify change within and across networks.</p>
<p>- Techniques to determine whether differences observed over time in networks are due simply to different samples from a distribution of links and nodes or due to changes over time in the underlying distribution of links and nodes.</p>
<p>The end goal is to understand the entire problem space well enough to predict/forecast change in existing networks. Managing the pedigree of the information must be addressed in order to accurately combine information from multiple sources.</p>
<p>2.1.2 Abnormality Detection in Counter Terrorism Evidence</p>
<p>Anomaly detection looks for entities whose characteristics, behaviors or connections to other individuals are in some way abnormal. Particular patterns of abnormality are not typically available, and therefore must be derived from data which is normal, by identifying deviations from "normal" patterns. Often it is the combination of several seemingly normal things that is abnormal.</p>
<p>Much of today's evidence consists of networks of entities and their interrelationships. However, most approaches for detecting abnormalities in this evidence consider only the attributes of the entities, or focus on the presence or absence of specific relationships, without considering the context of the abnormality. For example, in the case of fraud, the perpetrator attempts to mimic normal behavior in order to avoid detection. That is, abnormality only makes sense in the context of what is normal. In the case of networks, normal behavior can be represented by recurring normative patterns in the structure of the network, and abnormalities can be defined as unexpected deviations to these normative patterns, not just unexpected deviations within the network as a whole. In addition to methods for detecting outlier attributes and relationships, we also need methods for detecting anomalies to the prevalent, normal behavior reflected in the transactions among entities in the domain of interest. Such methods will provide several benefits, including the description of abnormalities within the context of the normal behavior they defy and the ability to detect these abnormalities without prior training in possible abnormalities; thus, providing the ability to detect previously unforeseen abnormalities. Combining these methods with the above methods on detecting patterns in dynamic networks will provide the ability to detect anomalies in both the structure and the dynamics of networks.</p>
<p>Single anomalies are often the result of noise, data mistakes, or other one-time-only phenomena and do not have significant practical interest. Identifying a collection of records that are each anomalous, but have some pattern of self-similarity, may make them indicative of a larger event. For example, a single strange case in the hospital emergency department is probably nothing more than that, but several of these across a city are indicative of a disease outbreak, or potential malicious activity. Research and development is needed to extend traditional anomaly detection methods to link data to discover linked groups of anomalous records along with efficient methods to scale this up to millions of links. This will enable discovery of linked groups of individuals engaged in anomalous activity, even if none are previously known to be dangerous, or the method of attack they are pursuing is novel.</p>
<p>Many times there are simply too many unique or rare events to make it useful to identify them all (not to mention having to determine how rare an event needs to be before it is reported). Sherlock Holmes stories typically see the detective observe a multitude of things that seem perfectly ordinary until he puts their significance together to solve the crime. Research and develop techniques to recognize situations of potential interest, and to tell a story that explains why the situations are of potential interest, without those situations having been predefined in detail. Develop models of relevancy. An abnormality that can be explained away through a simple non-threatening story should not be reported. Conversely, an abnormality that cannot be explained with a non-threatening story, or supports a threatening or opportunistic story should be reported. Develop capability to recognize situations of potential interest and explain why the situations are of interest, without those situations having been predefined in detail.</p>
<p>2.1.3 Layered Multi-Modal Network Analysis</p>
<p>The intent is to seek new and innovative ideas for experimental and theoretical development of technologies to fill Department of Defense (DoD) requirements for the development of a layered multi-modal network analysis (LMMNA) approach. Understanding the structure and dynamics of networks are of vital importance to winning the global war on terror. Current analysis of network data occurs primarily within one or two particular domains (e.g. derived from communications intelligence (COMINT) or human intelligence (HUMINT)). However, to fully understand the network environment, analysts must be able to investigate interconnected relationships of many diverse network types simultaneously as they evolve spatially and temporally. No single network exists in a vacuum as networks are interconnected through space and time.</p>
<p>The emphasis of this focus area is to research and develop a layered multi-modal networking approach that the user can interrogate and shape for their mission. A layered multi-modal network analysis (LMMNA) approach will be able to assemble previously disconnected networks (e.g. information derived from COMINT, open source intelligence (OSINT), imagery intelligence (IMINT), etc.) in a common battle space picture providing the user with timely situation awareness, understanding and anticipation of threats, and support for effective decision-making in diverse environments. Combining numerous networks will require various data transformation techniques such as standardization, normalization, as well as entity resolution. Emphasis will be on the development of an approach to apply network analysis methods (e.g. eigenvector centrality, group detection) and visualization technology to the collective network. This will allow an analyst to have all network data in a layered network application where they can correlate and analyze activity and time occurrence in related networks to understand and potentially predict when a major event of interest is about to happen and where to expect it.</p>
<p>The software developed is envisioned to be at the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6, system/subsystem model or prototype demonstration and validation in a relevant environment.</p>
<p>This work must be completed on site at AFRL/RI.</p>
<p>The recommended date for submittal of FY 11 white papers for the topic area above, 2.1.3, is until 8 October 2010.</p>
<p>2.2 Situation Analysis (SA). The objective of the SA area is to research and develop capabilities for comprehensive, integrated and continuous awareness of activities, systems and the environment across Air, Space and Cyber domains. This includes developing software tools that provide computational techniques to support the analysis of identities, behaviors, intentions, capability, capacity, kinematics, activity level, and saliences.</p>
<p>2.2.1 Space Situation Awareness. <br /><br />2.2.1.1 Space Situation Awareness includes perception, comprehension and anticipation of threats against blue (including coalition) space assets (satellites and their ground stations). Space threats encompass non-kinetic and kinetic attacks. Examples of non-kinetic threats include laser dazzling, RF jamming and cyber attacks against satellites and/or their command &amp; control ground stations. Examples of kinetic threats include Direct Assent Anti-Satellite Ballistic Missile (DA-ASAT) and Co-Orbital ASAT kinetic kill vehicles (KKV) in Low Earth Orbits (LEO), Medium Earth Orbits (MEO) and Geostationary Orbits (GEO). Space threats may be executed by multiple adversaries through simultaneous, coordinated attacks against multiple ground stations and satellites in the constellation (eg, a DA-ASAT attack against Satellite X by country A teamed with country B who is concurrently attacking Satellite Y by laser dazzling &amp; RF jamming). The objective of this technology area is to research and develop:</p>
<p>- Dynamic automated adversary modeling and alerting techniques which are needed to provide watch agencies', analysts and operators with enough advanced warning of coordinated attacks against multiple DoD (Department of Defense), National and commercial space assets in sufficient time for successful Defensive Counterspace (DCS) actions.</p>
<p>- Automated learning and reasoning approaches mentioned in 1.0 can be applied to the space domain. Automated space asset attack assessment indicates the probability and type of space asset attack, which coalition (air, ground, maritime, cyber) assets are vulnerable, the vulnerability period, and the confidence levels associated with the assessment. The impact of an attack needs to be understood as well as the effect asset degradation/failure has on coalition (air, ground, maritime, and cyber) operations so as to ensure unhindered integrated Command and Control (C2) of coalition forces.</p>
<p>2.2.1.2 Space Tracking and Object Characterization is an area of research to include, but not limited to, novel algorithms for automatic tracking of satellites to minimize the number of uncorrelated tracks on space objects, and decipher between debris and satellites.</p>
<p>- Novel techniques are needed in multi-source data (radar, optical and other) exploitation, analysis and fusion capabilities for timely, accurate and complete characterization of space objects, physical and functional analysis, events and situation assessment, threat determination and appropriate course of action development.</p>
<p>- High fidelity tools to fit into RI simulation environment are needed for satellite modeling, assessment of satellite vulnerabilities related to particular threats, automated classification of unknown or wrongly labeled space objects and corresponding probable mission. Research and development methods include physics based modeling and analysis of photometric and multispectral satellite signatures, improved detection, tracking, enhanced orbital cataloging, and characterization of satellite threats.</p>
<p>2.2.2 Assessment of Adversary Capability and Capacity</p>
<p>The intent is to seek new and innovative ideas for experimental and theoretical development of technologies to fill DOD requirements for development of a decision support system (DSS) that gathers/fuses data from various intelligence sources to streamline the assessment of a potential adversary's Capability &amp; Capacity. This includes advanced technology development software tools that provide computational techniques to support the analysis of capability and capacity, and machine learning approaches to capability/capacity model development. The software developed is envisioned to be at the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 5, system/subsystem/component validation in a relevant environment.</p>
<p>The recommended date for submittal of FY 11 white papers for the topic area above, 2.2.2, is until 02 July 2010.</p>
<p>3.0 ANTICIPATION</p>
<p>The intent of this area is to develop technologies which provide a detailed understanding of probable intent and future strategy in order to identify the set of potential courses of action (COAs) that both our adversaries and other entities' commanders have to consider while taking actions. Determine their most likely COAs, their COAs which have the greatest detrimental impact, and their most likely reactions to our COAs.</p>
<p>The vision is to provide the Decision Maker (DM) and their staff greater awareness into the range of alternate futures (state &amp; non-state actors); and to assist them in exploring the realm of the plausible in order to support: greater understanding of current conditions and possible outcomes (impact and plausibility); more robust/targeted courses of actions; better insight into potential ramifications of planned blue actions; greater variance in training scenarios for blue forces, minimizing surprise, while bounding the realm of the possible (better preparing our forces); better utilization of limited ISR resources; and an increased insight into what the adversary can/is doing against various blue assets/missions (to support fight through). This area cuts across and supports all Air Force domains (Air, Space, &amp; Cyber).</p>
<p>3.1 Understanding the Operational Environment (Nation-state)</p>
<p>The intent is to provide a Strategic Analysis/Assessment Tool that provides insight into the complex state space that is today's modern operational environment. In other words, given the current state of affairs within a specific region (or nation-state), what are the short, mid and long-term forecasts of its security, social, physical, and government support mechanisms and (stability) behavior.</p>
<p>Technology challenges include the ability to completely model complex regional and national environmental states (to include all factors and their inter-relationships) and to support the Blue Commander's ability to interact/investigate multiple options of achieving his "objectives." This is not to develop the blue COA but to support its development. The development is a Command and Control (C2) responsibility; large-scale multi-dimensional heuristics capable of identifying decision/leverage points; visualization methods that allow understanding of highly complex and multi-dimensional models; multi-constraint objective analysis; social-cultural modeling; behavioral modeling; integrated analysis tools that support rapid modeling and simulation of plausible futures based on continuous assessment of behavioral and environmental conditions; and methods to integrate discrete near and far term forecasting capabilities into a single service architecture application with near-real time analysis capability.</p>
<p>3.2 Understanding Adversary Behavior</p>
<p>The intent is to develop an operational/tactical analysis and assessment tool that forecasts potential adversaries' actions and events based on indications of known evidence and projected known and/or anticipated threat(s).</p>
<p>Technology challenges include: the integration of broad-spectrum adversarial modeling (individual to societal behaviors, infrastructure, and cyber); advancement of predictive sciences (constructive simulation, analytical methods); analysis of implications of the adversary's actions (based on capability, intent and opportunity) to identify potential threat(s); capabilities to project adversary courses of action; and ability to rank order potential actions as part of an adversary's COA as well as support to collection requirements.</p>
<p>3.3 Determine Adversary Opportunities</p>
<p>The intent is to seek new and innovative ideas for experimental and theoretical development of technologies to fill DOD requirements for determining adversary opportunities. The focus is on applied research and advanced technology development objectives for understanding adversarial opportunities to fit within the existing Situation Identification and Threat Assessment (SITA) framework. Given opportunities exists based on "our" vulnerabilities, this research focuses on the development of algorithms that will automatically identify the opportunities that an adversary might have in accomplishing their intent or goals. Focus should initially be on the cyber domain, but should be extensible to additional domains (cross domain) such as air, and space.</p>
<p>3.4 Identify Adversary Intent</p>
<p>The intent is to seek new and innovative ideas for experimental and theoretical development of technologies to fill DOD requirements to identify adversary intent. The focus is on applied research and advanced technology development objectives for identification of adversary intent to fit within the existing Situation Identification and Threat Assessment (SITA) framework. Current research will apply innovative techniques that will identify adversarial intent or goals. Focus should initially be on the cyber domain, but should be extensible to additional domains (cross domain) such as air, and space.</p>
<p>The recommended date for submittal of FY 11 white papers for the two topic areas above, 3.3 and 3.4, is 17 June 2010.</p>
<p>4.0: PERCEPTION</p>
<p>The intent of this area is to develop technologies which fuse multiple intelligence sources to provide awareness of all elements of the current battle space situation, including single entities, groups, and activities. Accurate perception of the battle space is a key enabler for both comprehension of the current situation and anticipation of future enemy actions, thus enabling a commander to make better decisions.</p>
<p>A major focus of the area is the ability to locate, identify, track and observe/monitor friendly, enemy, non-friendly, and non-aligned forces/actors anywhere/anytime in near real-time. Another concentration is on the development of forensic capabilities to analyze historical multi-INT data to enable more accurate perception of the current situation. This includes automated motion and behavioral pattern analysis, correlation of multi-INT data with social networks, and utilization of forensic data for sensor cueing. A final focus is on text extraction and understanding to determine entity profiles, define relationships, and identify events. Technology research and development in these areas include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>4.1: Network Centric Multi-INT Fusion: The major focuses in this area include Multi-INT feature aided tracking (FAT), knowledge and reasoning based association, algorithm based association, non-linear tracking, track/sensor management, and onboard processing.</p>
<p>4.1.1: Multi-INT FAT: The intent is to develop new algorithms that utilize multi-INT features to overcome the lack of persistent surveillance, large collection gap times, and dense target environments (&gt;3 targets per sensor resolution cell) that result in ambiguous association conditions in Multi-INT tracking and fusion algorithms that utilize kinematics only. Examples of features include, but are not limited to, advanced radar features such as high range-resolution radar (HRR), synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery and inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR), video imagery features such as color, shape and size, hyperspectral imagery features such as color and texture, ID features from SIGINT, and features obtained from HUMINT reports. FAT algorithms may utilize the features in combination with, or to augment the kinematic track state or to stitch pure kinematic tracklets after periods of kinematic confusion or extended sensor gaps. Algorithms which combine features into models such that cross-domain association (e.g. correlation of video with hyperspectral features) can occur are also sought. <br /><br />Algorithms are also sought for the specific case of extracting and combining multiple-features from multiple, homogeneous and heterogeneous video sensors in dense target environments to obtain longer, more accurate tracks. The key to this type of fusion is interoperability between the video sensors and sensors from other tracking sources such as non-imagery derived information sources. It is the current practice for the user to click on an object/pixel for manual nomination. The user is essentially telling the computer to track the selected object. The goal of the feature aided tracking portion of the effort would be to eliminate this bottleneck by devising algorithms that automatically perform this process and combine the results with other intelligence sources, such as MOVINT data.</p>
<p>4.1.2: Knowledge and Reasoning Based Association: The objective is to develop new methods and algorithms to overcome the factors discussed in 4.1.1 that limit Multi-INT tracking and fusion performance. Previous research has shown that augmenting traditional association methods with knowledge and reasoning based association algorithms shows great promise to increase tracking performance in difficult conditions. Technologies of interest include, but are not limited to knowledge based reasoning and learning, adductive and deductive reasoning, context based association and other heuristic techniques. Of specific interest are context based techniques which utilize information such as geospatial features, traffic models, cultural data, and forensically derived motion and behavioral patterns to aid the association problem.</p>
<p>4.1.3: Non-linear tracking: In this area of research, measures of nonlinearity have been explored to determine which non-linear tracking filter to use under various conditions. In fact, a filter swapping suite has been tried, and significant improvements were demonstrated. However, there is a much broader spectrum of nonlinear filters that can be employed, and advanced computing resources to exploit. The work in nonlinear filters needs to be expanded to consider vehicle dynamic models and new ways of predicting the performance of particle filters, Unscented Kalman Filters, and Extended Kalman Filters and other nonlinear tracking filters when used in conjunction with each other. <br /><br />4.1.4: Track/Sensor Management: The objective is to develop algorithms to manage sensor resources to maintain track on all targets in the battle space and maintain a consistent track picture. Sensor management techniques may be developed to manage multiple modes on a single sensor or multiple modes and sensor modalities across multiple platforms. For the latter case, centralized or distributed techniques may be utilized, but either must ensure that track pedigree information is maintained and a consistent track numbering scheme for outputting tracks is developed. Also of specific interest are sensor resource management techniques that balance the requirements between forensics and high value target tracking (i.e. short pure tracklets on all surveillance tracks vice extended-duration track on a smaller subset of targets).</p>
<p>4.1.5: Onboard processing: High resolution sensor platforms such as Constant Hawk, Angel Fire and proposed sensor platforms such as Gorgon Stare and Argus produce large amounts of data that can cause latency and information availability issues due to bandwidth limitations. The intent is to develop algorithms that can be implemented onboard the sensor platform and produce relevant information, requiring minimal bandwidth, so that this information can be distributed to a wide variety of users with minimal latency.</p>
<p>4.2: Moving Target Indicator (MTI) Analysis: Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) and Video: Automated Adaptive Pattern Recognition. The objective of this topic is to explore, identify, and prototype innovative approaches that process multiple movement based event streams to detect patterns and trends in real time or near real time. The ability to detect patterns in the flow of events will allow a proactive use of previously observed activity. The challenge is to provide these indicators and warnings for continually emerging tactics. Innovative algorithms are desired that will monitor all potential MOVINT data sources (S/GMTI, geospatial and temporal event info, coalition traffic patterns from Blue Force data, maritime data like Automatic Identification System (AIS), etc) to generate alerts in an autonomous or semi-autonomous manner.</p>
<p>4.2.1: Low Flying Targets: One of the greatest challenges in the analysis of MTI data is accounting for low flying targets that appear in MTI data. The capability to extract the low flying targets from certain GMTI databases is desired. Also, ground looking radars and video sensors are used to track and classify air vehicles and surface vehicles. Many of these systems rely on the intervention of an analyst to track and classify air vehicles and surface vehicles. Automation of this process through the development of knowledge based heuristics to distinguish between ground targets and low-flying targets within these GMTI databases would greatly improve the state of the art. In addition, the use of Air Moving Target (AMTI) templates at the beam clutter edges of a side-looking airborne radar when combined with GMTI information would greatly enhance the capability to extract low fliers from MTI data.</p>
<p>4.3: IED Forensics: The major focuses in this area include leveraging historical-temporal agility, geospatial reasoning and cued exploitation, and social/MTI network correlation. Of specific interest are the following areas:</p>
<p>4.3.1: Movement Augmented Network Analysis: The objective is to develop automated tools to reciprocally influence both derived movement information and social network analysis (SNA) to define and exploit the structure and behavior of the enemy. The intent is to develop movement derived link analysis capabilities to establish probabilistic linkages between people, places, other entities, and events. The movement derived linkages would then be utilized as an additional information source for SNA. The intent is also to develop automated tools for improved group detection (i.e. terrorist cells) by incorporating MTI or SIGINT derived linkages and more traditional transactional and soft data. Additionally of interest are automated tools that can exploit and fuse the data and intelligence products cited above as context for GMTI analyses.</p>
<p>4.3.2: Activity Analysis: The objective of this effort is to establish the nature and intent of meeting events by combining kinematic analysis with behavior analysis and SNA for enhanced and timely situational analysis (SA). It will provide actionable information on activities (or lack of) based upon GMTI and SIGINT data thus enabling timely situational analysis updates. Approaches must develop activity level detection/kinematic analysis tools that incorporate and exploit geospatial and temporal data, develop meeting analyst/behavior analyst software tool(s) to establish the type of meeting, phase of operation and potential participants, and develop an approach for this domain to accrue evidence of the nature and intent of meeting, phase of operation, participants and update SA. Technologies of interest include, but are not limited to, automatic tracking, spatial scan statistics, and Bayesian Networks and Dempster-Shafer evidence accrual.</p>
<p>4.4: Text Understanding: The major focus of this area is to help analysts more effectively exploit the information in unstructured and semi-structured textual data, such as Intelligence message traffic (e.g., Human Intelligence reports (HUMINT)), open source intelligence (OSINT), chat, and Significant Activity Reports (SIGACTs). The goal is to help analysts find potentially relevant information within large collections of documents faster, and to put it in a structured form enabling the use of automated analysis and visualization (A&amp;V) tools. Information of interest to analysts includes entities ("things", such as people, locations, organizations, weapons, facilities, etc.), entity attributes, relationships between entities, and events.</p>
<p>4.4.1 Specific user capabilities of interest include enabling automated link analysis and visualization from information in unstructured text, enabling automated analysis and visualization of events on timelines and maps, the creation and update of cross-document entity profiles that consolidate all the information extracted on a given real-world entity from 1,000s of documents ("electronic dossiers"), and the creation of cross-document event profiles that consolidate all the information extracted on a given real-world event from 1,000s of documents. Multilingual extraction and translation is also of keen interest to end users. In addition, exploiting the information in certain types of textual data (e.g., chat) is of high interest to users.</p>
<p>4.4.2 A number of research areas need to be pursued to mature text extraction technology to support the aforementioned user capabilities. These include, but are not limited to, entity extraction technology gaps, within-document co-reference resolution, cross-document co-reference resolution, temporal analysis of events (time-stamping), location-stamping of events (geo-coding), discourse analysis, subjective information extraction, inferring non-explicit information from text, rapid domain porting/customization with minimal training data and user interaction, multilingual text extraction, and high-accuracy extraction of information from certain text types of high interest to our users, such as chat and SIGACTs.</p>

<p>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit - Including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology; (2) Technology Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge; (3) Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness; and (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any). No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a TS-SCI facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to TS-SCI information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.</p>
<p>3. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS. Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use. Please note that use of the JIFFY or TFIMS application requires customers outside of the .mil domain to purchase an approved External Certificate Authority certificate to facilitate a secured log on process. It is necessary to obtain an ECA certificate BEFORE obtaining a JIFFY or TFIMS user account. Additional information on obtaining an ECA is available at: http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html .</p>

<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The Information Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL/RI), Rome Research Site, is soliciting white papers under this announcement for innovative technologies to enable the effective management of information for military operations. <br /><br />AFRL/RI has been conducting research in the areas of information dissemination and management. Resultant approaches have focused on the creation of services-based information management techniques. This research has led to the development of a series of information dissemination and management reference implementations based on an abstract architecture for information management. The continued development of innovative concepts and enhanced services that maximize the value of information to support the objectives of the military enterprise is the primary focus of this BAA.<br /><br /><strong>Background:</strong> The Information Management Branches of the Information Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Rome Research Site, are researching and developing techniques and services for information sharing and management. Information Management (IM) is defined as a set of intentional activities to maximize the value of information to support the objectives of the military enterprise. These activities include the promulgation of standards, control of information and the administrative activities that support it. Data capture and discovery, data shaping, dissemination, manipulation for exploitation, persistence and destruction of information supporting the entire enterprise information lifecycle, all provide an information advantage and allows the proficient sharing of information across the Department of Defense (DoD) and with mission partners. <br /><br />An information centric technology view is central to the AFRL Information Management vision. Understanding how concepts for sharing information amongst multiple producers, consumers and operational domains and the technologies that can be applied in the unique military operational and tactical domains are of critical importance. These information sharing techniques will be established based on multiple factors such as geographic regions, functional requirements, organizational boundaries, and network topology/infrastructure. The necessary modes of interaction will require higher-level services where service agreements help manage the interactions in a seamless and efficient manner. <br /><br />The objective of IM is to discover, contextualize, and share quality information among producers and consumers within available resources and policy constraints. This must be accomplished across network and enclave boundaries to enable true information dominance. Information deemed "quality" information is trusted, pertinent and relevant while adhering to temporal constraints. Trusted information is of known provenance, evaluable, confidential and available with integrity. The pertinence of information is determined by the appropriate granularity, format, fidelity, and transfer rate of the information. Relevant information conforms to the role and mission of the consumer and is significantly related to information criticality. The timeliness of information ensures temporal relevance to support an action or decision.<br /><br />The quantum of managed information, referred to as a Managed Information Object (MIO), is comprised of a payload (e.g., document, imagery, or video clip) and metadata that characterizes the payload context (e.g., topic, time, and location). Information repositories and an information catalogue represent major entities within the information space that assist both consumers and producers in assuring their information requirements are satisfied. The MIO metadata is used in the information catalog to describe what information is currently available or may become available in the future. <br /><br />The four major technical areas addressed in this BAA, Federated Information Spaces, Mission-Driven Quality of Service, Survivable Information Services and Dynamic Information Relationship Exploitation are of current interest to the Information Directorate and support the development and operation of AFRL Information technology goals. <br /><br /><strong>Federated Information Spaces:</strong> Information management involves a set of actors who interact with the information infrastructure and are categorized as producers, consumers, federates and managers. Producers are information space clients that add information to the information space. That information will reside in either persistent or transient information repositories. Producers may publish information, advertise capabilities, process feedback from consumers, receive requests for information or retract inaccurate information. Consumers are information space clients that request and utilize information within the information space via a subscription or by issuing a search. Consumers can browse, query, subscribe, transform and assess the suitability of information within the information space. <br /><br />Multiple-connected information spaces are referred to as "federated information spaces." Federates virtually extend the contents of an information space by appropriately sharing information among other federation members. The federation interfaces to the information space encompass trust management, confidentiality and integrity management, policy mediation, content filtering, information replication, and pass-through processing activities. Federation managers are software components responsible for policy, resource management, maintenance services and processes that permit the information space to process information demands in a secure, timely, and reliable manner. Manager responsibilities are as follows: monitor and control the information; navigate and understand the syntactic relationships among MIO types; dictate, understand and delegate prevailing security policies on MIO types; monitor and control resource allocation and performance; ensure accurate data mediation; configure and monitor effectiveness of information support; establish and maintain federated space relationships; maintain information space currency; and audit information infrastructure transactions. <br /><br />A single universal information space is unlikely to be achieved in any sufficiently complex military endeavor and it will be necessary to have multiple information spaces where clients need to breach both logical and physical boundaries to retrieve the information they require. The desire is to have the information itself foster a connection forming a federation that allows an information space to be &lsquo;extended' by the contents of another. The advantage provided by this class of federation is providing consumers a "single" information space. Producers merely share information within their &lsquo;native' information space and federation services ensure that it is shared appropriately with other federate members. Having the information spaces interact directly will require service agreements between the respective information spaces.<br /><br /><strong>Mission-Driven Quality of Service:</strong> The layers of services that form the information management infrastructure empower an information space wherein information is managed directly, rather than delegating all information management responsibilities to applications that produce and consume information. Actors interact with one another indirectly through the information space and the layers of services that manage the information within the information space. The activities of information management can be organized into multiple service layers. These service layers include security, workflow, Quality of Service (QoS), transformation, brokerage, and information space maintenance. The security layer includes access control, transaction and audit logging, security policy with federated information spaces, identity protection and an ability to sanitize content. The primary functions that enable effective enterprise workflows are managing workflow configurations, which encompass instantiating and maintaining workflows and assessing and optimizing their performance. <br /><br />The QoS layer is responsible for ensuring that an information management system can best serve the needs of its consumers, producers and federated information spaces when faced with changing operating conditions in the communication and information levels within available resources. Activities that can be performed in an information space to increase service quality in the information domain are: respond to client context, allocate resources to clients, prioritize results and replicate information. The primary activities within the transformation layer are contextualizing information, transforming MIOs (e.g. interoperability), state- and context-sensitive information processing and supporting user and manager defined processing functions. The role of the brokerage layer is to match available (or potentially available) information to information needs. The brokerage layer is responsible for processing queries, supporting browsing, maintaining subscriptions, notifying consumers, processing requests for information, and supporting federated information space proxies. The maintenance layer interacts directly with the underlying information space. It is responsible for posting new information to the information space repositories, verifying the format of posted information, informing the brokerage layer of the introduction of new MIOs, managing the lifecycle of MIOs in the repositories, managing internal information space performance, providing support for configuration management of models stored in the information space (e.g., work flow models and MIO types) and for retrieving specific MIOs from the information space repositories. <br /><br /><strong>Survivable Information Services:</strong> Current IM services lack sufficient protection against malicious attacks, planned and unplanned disruptions, corruption and leakage of information. Improving the survivability for the next generation of (IM) services can be accomplished by extending current architecture and design techniques to include Information Assurance (IA)-cognizant and survivable methodologies. Mechanisms for preserving system availability, integrity, and confidentiality will support continued operation through sustained cyber attacks while avoiding a single point of failure. Further development of information-centric activity monitoring mechanisms, which allow capture of activities across distributed services, will provide a greater level of insight into service capability and real-time state information.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><strong>Dynamic Information Relationship Exploitation:</strong> The role of the Information Catalogue is to maintain meta-information representative of information inherent to use of the information space. The meta-information may include the stored information index, models (the taxonomy of the different MIOs supported by the information space) and producer and consumer client status. The information repositories receive, maintain, and provide the actual pieces of information or MIOs. An important factor driving the effectiveness of IM services is the degree to which metadata describes available information.<br /><br />Static, document-centric IM solutions have led to inefficiencies in relational semantics and the absence of the ability to adequately correlate dynamic information sources. This has created a fundamental requirement to create a more adaptive and organic information model. The exploration of techniques for establishing autonomic information relationships will aid in exploiting related information between information instances and classes. Developing solutions for dynamic information grouping, group management and exploitation capabilities will enable cross and multi-type subscription and query provisioning. Refining the flexibility in the model and enabling any existing information to be managed while exploiting its native format and processing algorithms is vital. Enabling transparent mechanisms that exploit interrelationship between multiple types of information to dynamically create new, more comprehensive information should also be explored.<br /><br />Additional reference information: <br />1.

The objectives of this BAA is to solve the technical problems inherent to moving beyond manipulation of information as a set of singular objects and focus on information quality, relationships, and fault tolerance. <br /><br /><strong>FY10 Focus Areas:<br /><br />Survivable Information Management<br /><br /></strong>Survivable systems are capable of adapting their behavior, function, and resource allocation in response to a variety of intermittent and permanent disruptions to maintain adequate levels of mission functionality. Understanding the operational range of expected deployment configurations and survivability requirements is a necessary condition to instrumenting a responsive survivable system. This task focuses on the development of operationally relevant, mission focused, deployment scenarios and survivability requirements. This task also requires the specification of an assessment framework for evaluating the efficacy of approaches to address survivability requirements within the context of varied deployment configurations. <br /><br />Offerors are encouraged to:<br /><br />&bull; identify operational deployments for Information Management (IM) services focusing on tactical environments. <br />&bull; identify and describe missions and mission scenarios within tactical operational deployments that capitalize on the use of IM services.<br />&bull; define mission centric survivability requirements that identify and describe required levels of IM service quality and availability. <br />&bull; define, design and implement an assessment framework which will be used to test and assess survivability techniques in mission oriented, operationally relevant contexts.</p>
<p><strong>Tactical Information Management<br /><br /></strong>Tactical Information Management (TIM) has many of the same objectives as IM as discussed in the master BAA 10-08-RIKA announcement, but with the added focus on dismounted users, improved radio-based communications and resource constraints that aren't present in enterprise-class defense applications. Emphasis for this research will be on a series of demonstrations with feedback from real users to learn practical lessons and improve the overall system.<br /><br />Offerors are encouraged to focus on the exploration of techniques applicable to tactical situations for: <br /><br />&bull; improving effective/reliable communications in low bandwidth (as low as 2 kbps) situations<br />&bull; service discovery and prioritization<br />&bull; TIM interfaces in a resource-constrained environment<br />&bull; effective management of various tactical data types in a manner that is relevant to dismounted users<br />&bull; effective, prioritized reach-back to federated systems in a bandwidth-aware manner<br /><br />Offerors are also encouraged to build upon existing IM and QOS components for this work, including the AFRL-developed Advanced Information Management System (AIMS), Marti, and Phoenix/Fawkes, in order to maximize productivity for the research, and to provide maximum benefit to the Government.<br /><br />(2) The recommended date for submittal of FY 11 white papers for the two topic areas above is 24 June 2010.<br /><br /><strong>FY12 Focus Areas:<br /><br /></strong>Offerors should be conscious of our increasing focus on the use of Service<br />Oriented Architecture (SOA) to maximize interoperability and reusability of<br />AFRL-developed technologies. Offers should demonstrate an understanding of<br />service development and, to the extent reasonable and possible, propose<br />deliverables that are readily deployed as services (i.e., discoverable,<br />well-defined, self-contained modules that are independent of state or<br />context of other services). Where SOA is a viable part of an offeror's<br />technical approach, offeror should be prepared to discuss SOA infrastructure<br />requirements at program kickoff and updates to decomposition and<br />implementation status discussed at technical program reviews. Potential SOA<br />deliverables might include Web Service Description Language (WSDL) service<br />definitions, documented service behaviors (dependencies, sequence diagrams,<br />stateful assumptions), and configurable virtual machine service deployments.</p>
<p><strong>INFORMATION MANAGEMENT (IM) IN THE CLOUD<br /><br /></strong>Growing capabilities to collect intelligence data are quickly outpacing our ability to manage and exploit this information. Current collection capabilities produce an incredible amount of data that needs to be contextualized, organized, and stored for the purposes of efficient information retrieval and analysis. While there is no formal definition of what a "cloud" is, cloud computing is essentially a means to provide access to services over the Internet on the fly without a significant investment in new infrastructure, training, or licensed software. A trend toward the adoption of cloud computing is being observed within the DoD and Federal sectors as a means to save costs. IM services will need to be designed to operate in this new environment and leverage cloud resources to ingest messages at a rate that is proportional to the size and frequency of data coming off of surveillance platforms. Once ingested, this large volume of data needs to be indexed and catalogued so that hundreds of external users can find the information they need for forensic analysis. Internal to the cloud, the data must be quickly delivered to large object processing and exploitation services for the production of actionable information for subsequent dissemination to users external to the cloud. Cloud computing is a natural evolution of the widespread adoption of virtualization, SOA, and utility computing where software and hardware capabilities are delivered as services to customers. Next generation IM services will need to exploit the elasticity properties of the cloud, that is, the ability to scale-up capacity on demand and scale-down and release that capacity when it is no longer needed. We seek to assess cloud computing technologies for "best of breed" features to host, build and deploy economy-of-scale IM services, identify the technical challenges associated with deploying IM services to the cloud, and architect, build and deploy cloud capable IM services that are affordable, scalable and meet mission and information assurance requirements.<br /><br />Offerors are encouraged to:<br /><br />&bull; Identify how to optimize the use of the resiliency, scalability, and flexibility features offered by various cloud solutions (e.g., private, public and hybrid) to best deploy scalable IM services.<br />&bull; Investigate and develop mechanisms that cloud resource monitoring and control that are adequate for influencing required Quality of Service (QoS) and information delivery prioritization policies.<br />&bull; Investigate the ramifications of cloud-based services on information and mission assurance (e.g., security, survivability, availability, and consistency).<br />&bull; Design and implement cloud-ready IM services that can fully exploit the promises of increased elasticity, performance, availability and reliability offered by the cloud.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>OpenPod<br /><br /></strong>OpenPod will provide a significant net-centric capability to many existing AF platforms without modification to their Operational Flight Programs (OFPs) - a significant hurdle for technology insertion. The objective of OpenPod is to increase pilot (and other user) effectiveness through: 1) the development of information management (IM) capabilities, 2) the instantiation of those capabilities in a tactical pod, and 3) the exposure of information and enabled applications via the multi-function displays (MDF). OpenPod will also facilitate connectivity to tactical collaborators and to those users in the broader enterprise with post-mission responsibilities. To accomplish this, we need a capability to rapidly evolve the mission software suite over time and to load and access a mission-appropriate subset of that suite in an open-standards-based manner. There are several key challenges to achieving this capability. The first is the protection of applications from one another (to be accomplished with SE Linux); the second is to be able to toggle between applications in an intuitive manner; the third is to be able to configure their respective data sources and sinks in a dynamic tactical environment. OpenPod will allow greatly enhanced processing of data in real-time on the pod, as well as the timely addition of new pod capabilities by third parties through the use of an OpenPod application programming interface (API), including the ability to leverage the embedded HPC in the pod.</p>
<p>Offerors are encouraged to:<br /><br />&bull; Investigate and develop mechanisms to enhance aircraft net-centric capability without relying upon or modifying the OFP of the host platform.<br />&bull; Design and develop modifications to existing pods (e.g. Litening) to expand Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) for computational elements.. <br />&bull; Build upon current AFRL-developed prototypes to modernize the MDF interface to support on-board information management services. <br />&bull; Demonstrate the ability to archive and retrieve data from pod repositories post-mission for construction of mission briefs and for pre-loading pod repositories pre-mission. <br />&bull; Design and integrate hardware modifications to a Litening or Litening-class pod to support onboard signal processing, archive, and retrieval with support for net-centric operations without reliance upon or modification of host platform OFP.<br />&bull; Develop software to present archived and real-time data hosted on the pod to the pilot for improved situation awareness.</p>
<p><strong>Secure Tactical/Enterprise Gateway <br /><br /></strong>A secure tactical-to-enterprise gateway is necessary to provide effective, efficient, and secure information exchange between tactical and enterprise systems, protecting both the warfighter from threats in the enterprise environment and the enterprise environment from threats in the tactical edge. In order to ensure timely situational awareness across the tactical battlespace, the Air Force needs a gateway that enables tactical systems to communicate with the enterprise systems that handle much of the protocol, security, and resource mediation. Ultimately, we seek to understand how every packet that passes through the gateway supports the mission, what priority it deserves, whether it presents a threat to the network, and what will break if it is dropped. Secure Tactical/Enterprise Gateway (STEG) will provide a robust and secure router for message traffic passed between the operations floor and tactical IP-based networks. This task focuses on the development of such a system to manage the boundary between the operations center networks and IP-based tactical networks that is robust, prioritized, and compatible with current mission planning tools. This task also requires the use of SOA services, in addition to any other instantiations required or desired, to maximize interoperability and usability.<br /><br />Offerors are encouraged to:<br /><br />&bull; Investigate and develop intelligent SOA-based IM services that prioritize the information that is sent into the tactical environment.<br />&bull; Investigate and develop mediation frameworks for resource profiles, threat models, requirements, and constraints of the different environments, and the bridge from tactical to enterprise, enterprise to enterprise through the tactical edge, and tactical to tactical through the enterprise, to balance the amount of security that is needed and that one can afford.<br />&bull; Investigate and develop a connection abstraction between the tactical and enterprise environment with the appearance and functionality of one parameterized connection presented to the tactical side that map seamlessly to different parameterized connections to enterprise sides and their security requirements.<br />&bull; Investigate and develop mechanisms to maintain and improve functionality, performance, and reliability of constant connectivity even as resources, connectivity, and topology change dynamically, and a means for automatic reconnection in intermittent connectivity situations.<br />&bull; Investigate and develop how to limit the impact of devices that are compromised or fall into enemy hands.<br />&bull; Investigate and develop security solutions and configurations to address the vulnerabilities and threat models for composed tactical and enterprise environments and their integration points. <br /><br />II.

<p>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in following order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government. Criteria, (1) through (3) are of equal importance and criteria (4) is of lesser importance than criteria (1) through (3): (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit - The extent to which the offeror's approach demonstrates an understanding of the problem, the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology, integration approach, innovative and novel approach and appropriate levels of readiness at yearly intervals, (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, (3) Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness and (4) Reasonableness and Realism of Proposed Costs - The overall estimated costs and fees (if any) should be clearly justified and appropriate for the technical complexity of the effort. No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received. Cost sharing will not be considered in the evaluation.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will review the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission.<br />2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.</p>
<p>3. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS. Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use. Please note that use of the JIFFY or TFIMS application requires customers outside of the .mil domain to purchase an approved External Certificate Authority certificate to facilitate a secured log on process. It is necessary to obtain an ECA certificate BEFORE obtaining a JIFFY or TFIMS user account. Additional information on obtaining an ECA is available at: http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html .</p>

<DESC><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This sources sought synopsis has been updated as of 15 June 2011. The updates are underlined in the notice below. Please respond ONLY if you can provide ALL requirements listed below. </span></p>
<p>F-16 Mission Training Center (MTC) Follow-on Services Sources Sought Notice</p>
<p>Description<br />I. Sources Sought Synopsis: This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS), no solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the US Government to form a binding contract. Companies that respond will not be paid for the information submitted.</p>
<p>a) The Government is conducting market research to identify, as potential sources, companies that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to competently and competitively respond to requirements to provide training services for F-16 Mission Training Centers (MTC) following the end of the existing MTC services contract in October 2012. Only United States companies will be considered for contract award. <br />b) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and Proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Companies responding to this market research are advised that participation does not ensure participation in future solicitations or contract awards. The Government will not reimburse any company or individual for any expenses associated with preparation or participation in this research. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this SSS.<br />c) Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this Sources Sought Synopsis, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal. <br />d) Background: The F-16 MTCs are currently operating at the following Air Force Bases: Shaw, Misawa, and Spangdahlem. The F-16 MTCs are part of the Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) Program. DMO is an operational readiness initiative that networks geographically separated training devices in a real-time synthetic battlefield. It is scalable to provide individual, team, and team-of-teams combat training and mission rehearsal. It is the backbone for the Virtual Flag exercise used for AEF spin-up and the cornerstone of the AF training transformation. The F-16 MTC Integrated Product Team at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is responsible for fielding aircrew training device capability that ensures the trainers maintain concurrency with the aircraft co-located at each base. Currently this capability is provided through a training simulation services contract that meets the Air Force requirements. This contract is programmed to end in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">October 2012</span>.</p>
<p>e) The Government anticipates a FAR Part 15, services contract with a total delivery period of no fewer than <span style="text-decoration: underline;">one (1) year</span> and no more than three (3) years (one base year period with four six month options).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">f) ALL CURRENT MTC EQUIPMENT IS CONTRACTOR OWNED, in the required aircraft platform configuration and DMO standards, therefore no equipment will be provided by the Government. Any potential offeror must be able to provide fully operational F-16 units to the Air Force.</span> All services will be housed in Government facilities and utilized by personnel designated by the government. Government-contracted instructors, separate from this acquisition, will use all aspects of the services in preparation for and conduct of lessons.</p>
<p>g) Payment for training services under this contract will commence with start of service at each site.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">h) The purpose of this SSS is to determine offeror interest in providing training service support on contractor-owned fully operational F-16 MTC units to the Air Force. </span></p>
<p>II. Program Requirements:</p>
<p>a) This document specifies the performance requirements for the United States Air Force (USAF) F-16 Block 50 Mission Training Center (MTC) System Services that provide interim training services between the current contract, FA8621-07-D-6272, and the Full-Up F-16 Block 40/42/50/52 System Procurement contract. In this document the term Block 50 refers to F-16 Block 50/52. System Services refers to the total services provided under this contract, to include, but not limited to F-16 MTC simulation, security, mission control, and support capabilities. An F-16 Mission Training Center (MTC) shall consist of a four-ship F-16 system simulation along with scenario generation capability and two briefing/debriefing stations. Each System Simulation will consist of a representation of the appropriate F-16 aircraft model, both cockpit and software simulation, Instructor Operator Station (IOS), and a synthetic environment.

The IOS shall provide the capability to insert malfunctions during generation, setup, or execution of scenarios (preprogram or manually input) for all aircraft, systems, and weapons. The IOS shall have the capability for secure private communication with any other IOS within the F-16 MTC and with any individual crew under its control.</p>
<p>4) Visual Display System. The visual simulation shall provide high fidelity OTW and sensor (including NVIS and Helmet Mounted Cueing System (HMCS)) views correlated together along with all displayed information in the cockpit to support instruments, navigation, A/G, and A/A missions. Visual cues presented to the pilot shall simulate those in the F-16 aircraft and shall not present false, erroneous, or inappropriate perceptions that would adversely impact aircrew training. The visual simulation shall support realistic Detection, Orientation, Recognition, Identification (DORI), target range, aspect angle, and closure rate determination by crew members for all targets and threats. The visual simulation shall support mission report functions such as visual Line-of-Sight (LOS) ranging, LOS material property, LOS entity ID, height of terrain, weapons impact detection, collisions detection, and intervisibility testing. Terrain and other solid objects shall appropriately limit physical flyout of weapons. The visual simulation shall display realistic representations of hostile and friendly weapons effects (e.g., missiles in flight, AAA, bomb detonations, cluster bomb detonations, smoke columns, multi-state damaged models, countermeasures, SAM launch blast, SAM trajectory, and gun tracer trajectory).</p>
<p>5) Networking. The F-16 MTC shall be capable of providing distributed exercise and regular recurring DMO participation. The system shall interoperate with other existing and planned DMO Systems and shall comply with the adopted DMO System Standards. The F-16 MTC shall operate as a participating DMO Federate System in the DMO System for distributed network training. The F-16 MTC shall support the simultaneous conduct of any combination of local single-ship and networked missions, and DMO Events. The DMON will be interconnected with other Department of Defense (DoD) military services' training systems in the future to accommodate Joint Task Force (JTF) training. The F-16 MTC shall not develop any unique architecture or non-standards-compliant interfaces that would preclude or otherwise limit DMO connectivity and interoperability. No degradation in operating performance shall be noticed in the F-16C MTC when operating in the DMO environment except as limited by fidelity or interoperability of external entities not under the control of the F-16 MTC. All missions and operations supported in the local training modes shall be supported in the DMO environment. This includes training with external constructive, virtual, or live entities.</p>
<p>6) Briefing/Debriefing (B/DB) Capability. The F-16 MTC shall include two B/DB capable rooms. The B/DB rooms shall have a minimum occupancy of 8 people per room. The B/DB rooms shall be interchangeable and B/DB shall be able to operate simultaneously at multiple levels of security. The B/DB shall support mission generation/modification capabilities. The B/DB shall provide simultaneous video teleconferencing to support briefing and debriefing without degrading any local mission or DMO Event in progress. The B/DB capability shall operate at the same network security level as the mission being supported. The briefing capability shall support commercial briefing presentation formats commonly used by F-16 instructors and flight leads for accessing and presenting squadron briefings. The briefing capability shall support pre-mission planning and briefing to prepare F-16 pilots for any existing mission scenario, and shall be interoperable with Air Force mission planning systems. For DMO Events, the briefing capability shall support simultaneous viewing of presentation data with secure distributed participant teleconference video and audio. The debriefing capability shall support debriefing of the F-16 pilots for any recorded mission scenario. The debriefing capability shall permit the playback of recorded segments of a mission scenario from each local cockpit's perspective and a God's eye view at normal and accelerated speeds. The debriefing capability shall display a summary on the effectiveness of maneuvers, countermeasures, weapons delivery, and the percentage of damage incurred on a target for battle damage assessment. B/DB shall include a large display three-dimensional or God's eye view (vertical, horizontal, or from any point in space) of the scenario with a zoom capability to observe selected views of the engagement. Air Combat Maneuvering Instrumentation (ACMI) performance may be used as a guide. The B/DB capability shall support mission situational awareness by providing mission playback from any perspective of the battlefield, selectable cockpit views (friendly, neutral, hostile), stealth views and tied/wingman visuals with appropriate parameters (friendly, neutral, or hostile), while simultaneously displaying information from all F-16 MTCs. B/DB shall include a display area per cockpit simulator to allow simultaneous display of each crew's recorded information. Changing views or display options shall be available real-time during playback.</p>
<p>e) F-16 pilots obtain over 20 percent of their overall training events through the MTC; therefore, Air Combat Command requires no break in training during the transition from the incumbent contractor. <br />f) F-16 MTCs must be delivered and maintained in a fully operational status that remains concurrent with the home station aircraft configuration and that maintains the ability to be available for use at least 95 percent of the time. The operational hours for Shaw AFB are ten (10) hours per day, five (5) days a week; Misawa and Spangdahlem operate eight (8) hours per day, five (5) days a week.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide the following additional instructions to all Offerors':<br /><br />Throughout the acquisition phase, the Government will make available technical data and other information through the technical data/Offerors' library. The Offerors' library contains classified and export-controlled data; therefore, access will be restricted to personnel who have been cleared by MDA Contracting and Security Officials. The procedure for receipt and review of requests for library access is to obtain and sign an "Offerors' Library Access Agreement". This form may be obtained by email request to <a href="mailto:ClearCompetition@mda.mil">ClearCompetition@mda.mil</a>. The Government intends to make the Offerors' library available at time of release of the Draft RFP to those Offerors' who have emailed ClearCompetition@MDA.mil and completed the necessary steps to obtain access. The Government anticipates that the process will take approximately 3 weeks to complete. Therefore, it is imperative that you request the Agreement as soon as possible. The Government intends to host Industry Days and Site visits to Clear and Cape Cod. A Visit Authorization Request (VAR) for each location will be required to be submitted 14 calendar days prior to the first industry date. There will be a composite limit of 5 representatives from each prime offeror which includes vendor representatives. The instructions for submitting VAR requests may be obtained by sending an email request to <a href="mailto:ClearCompetition@MDA.mil">ClearCompetition@MDA.mil</a>.&nbsp; <br />Email <a href="mailto:ClearCompetition@MDA.mil">ClearCompetition@MDA.mil</a> with questions, comments or concerns.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) in Orlando, Florida is responsible for acquisition, fielding and life cycle support of training systems.   Fielded Training Device (FTD) 2F196-1 was recently relocated to Marine Corps Air Station New River, North Carolina with no accompanying spare and repair parts.  Ensuring the availability of a material support package after the trainer has been relocated is critical in fulfilling NAWCTSDâs responsibility. The spare and repair parts must meet form, fit and function requirements and are commercially available from the brand name vendors listed in Attachment 1 - Brand Name Spare and Repair Parts List.  The brand name spare and repair parts are the focus of this notice, pending issuance of a Justification and Approval.
  NAWCTSD intends on awarding a competitive Commercial Item Purchase Order to a company who can provide the multiple brand names spare and repair items. The total estimated amount of this order is expected to approach $460,000.

Pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulations 6.302-1(c) application for brand name description, the proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit for a specific brand name and serves as a pre-solicitation notice of this contract action.  The intent of this notice is to meet the market research requirement and to justify that the use of such brand name descriptions are essential to the Governmentâs requirements.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, interested parties not identified within Attachment 1 are encouraged to express their interest and capability to respond to the requirements.
  Responses to this Sources Sought notice shall be sent to lynn.carlson@navy.mil and received no later than close of business 5 July 2011.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether respondents are capable of meeting the Governmentâs requirements.  In those situations where the Government determines that the brand name descriptions are not essential, and are available from more than one source, the brand name requirements will be replaced with brand name or equal requirements, if applicable.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract action will be based upon responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Division Newport, RI (NUWCDIVNPT) intends to award a Firm Fixed Price, Sole Source contract to Ultra Electronics Ocean Systems (Ultra), Braintree, MA.  The NUWCDIVNPT requirement is for 37 DT-513D Hydrophones to be delivered 28 weeks after receipt of order.  Ultra was the previous provider of this item under contract N66604-04-D-1243 and is the only vendor that is certified by NUWCDIVNPT to provide the DT-513D Hydrophones.   This item is essential to fleet readiness, and the Government estimates based on past experience that the first article test, certification, and delivery of production units would take 30 months if the award were made to a vendor other than Ultra.
  This does not meet the Governmentâs required delivery schedule.  This is a one-time buy until solicitation N66604-11-R-0679, which is the follow-on to N66604-04-D-1243, can be awarded. The NAICS is 334511; size standard is 750 Employees.  The proposed contract action is for 37 DT-513D Hydrophones for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  Solicitation # N66604-11-Q-3227 will be posted on or about 7/5/11.  NOTE: This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.
 Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  For information on this acquisition please contact Andrew Nagelhout at 401-832-3844 or andrew.c.nagelhout@navy.mil

<DESC><p><strong>UPDATE - An extension to the deadline for submital of qualifications has been issued.&nbsp; The new deadline is July 11, 2011, at 3:30 p.m. (PDST).&nbsp; Please note that the RFQ packages were initially released on May 9, 2011, and that the Pre-RFQ meeting was held on May 21, 2011.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any firms still interested in receiving the RFQ should submit a letter of interest by FAX to FAX Number 415.522.3316, Attention: Colleen Butler, Contract Specialist, or by e-mail to colleen.butler@gsa.gov, or mail to: GSA, Design and Construction Division (9P2PCS), ATTN: Colleen Butler, 450 Golden Gate Avenue, 3rd Floor West, San Francisco, CA 94102.&nbsp; FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE CALL COLLEEN BUTLER AT 415.522.3170.</strong><br /><br />The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for qualified contractors with Design Build project delivery experience to provide site design and to construct new housing in Ajo, Arizona, for Customs and Border Protection (CBP) as GSA's client. Ajo is approximately 135 miles west of Tucson, Arizona, 112 miles southwest of Phoenix, Arizona, and 38 miles north of Lukeville, Arizona, on the border with Mexico and adjacent to Sonoita, Mexico. The project is bounded on the west by Sahuaro Road, the north by Esperanza Avenue, and the south by an arroyo. Due to the small size of the town of Ajo, CBP needs to make housing available to their personnel in order to meet its mission at this location.</p>
<p>The project includes (but is not limited to) the design and construction of all grading, drainage, underground utilities (water, sanitary sewer, storm drainage, gas (if required), electricity, telephone, CATV, internet), streets, and sidewalks street lighting for approximately 46 modular, or stick-built, housing units on 11.61 acres. In addition a Common Area consisting of a 600sf playground, and 6 picnic tables, each with a shade structure, picnic table and barbecue pit shall be included. Design Build Bridging Documents (DBBD) is in development and will be issued with the Request for Proposals (RFP) in Phase Two of this procurement.</p>
<p>The estimated cost for the design-build delivery of the site design and construction for the project is projected to be around $5,000,000 to $10,000,000, with project award anticipated in August 2011.</p>
<p>GSA intends to award a firm-fixed price competitive acquisition using the best-value trade-off process. This Two-Stage procurement process for the Design-Build Contract will be based upon evaluation criteria developed pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 36.3, Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures, and FAR subpart 15.3, Source Selection Procedures.</p>
<p>Phase One - Request for Qualifications (RFQ) will identify those firms which are most highly qualified. A maximum of five (5) firms will be selected for consideration for Phase Two - Request for Proposal (RFP). The short list will be based on the firms' submittals in response to the Phase One - RFQ. The Phase Two - RFP submission is the basis of making the final selection. Those firms included in Phase Two will be required to prepare fully developed technical and price proposals. The Government will not allow any stipend for preparation of proposals. Offerors can be a partnership, corporation, association, and/or other legal entity which will have contractual responsibility for the project.

<DESC>The protocol and audit program performance requested under this contract shall assist OCR in operating an audit program that effectively implements the statutory requirement to audit covered entity and business associate compliance with the HIPAA privacy and security standards as amended by ARRA. The audits shall be conducted through a contracted firm(s) under the guidance of HHS staff.
<p>After developing the audit protocol the contractor will be required to meet entities and perform the following audit activities:</p>
<p>Site visits conducted as part of every audit would include interviews with leadership (e.g., CIO, Privacy Officer, legal counsel, health information management/medical records director); examination of physical features and operations; consistency of process to policy, observation of compliance with regulatory requirements</p>
<p>After each site visit the contractor must submit an audit report. Audit reports consist of the following information:</p>
<p>a timeline and methodology of the audit; best practices noted; raw data collection materials such as completed checklists and interview notes; a certification indicating the audit is complete. The report must include specific recommendations for actions the audited entity can take to address identified compliance problems through a corrective action plan. The report must include recommendations to the COTR regarding continued need for corrective action, if any, and description of future oversight recommendations. Final Reports shall include, at minimum:<br />&bull; Identification and description of the audited entity: Include, full name, address, EIN, contact person.<br />&bull; Methods used to conduct the audit<br />&bull; For each finding:<br />o Condition: the defect or noncompliant status observed, and evidence of each<br />o Criteria: a clear demonstration that each negative finding is a potential violation of the Privacy or Security Rules, with citation<br />o Cause: The reason that the condition exists, along with identification of supporting documentation used <br />o Effect: the risk or noncompliant status that results from the finding <br />o Recommendations for addressing each finding <br />o Entity corrective actions taken, if any <br />&bull; Acknowledgement of any best practice(s) or success(es).<br />&bull; Overall conclusion paragraph</p>
<p>The nature of this work makes it impossible to anticipate the level of effort needed for each audit. The government anticipates completing 150 audits of entities varying in size and scope. The first part of this requirement which consists of developing the audit protocols is firm fixed price. The second portion of the requirement is also firm fixed price however due to vary nature each conducting each audit, the implementation portion of this requirement cannot be defined in manner to enable a firm fixed price methodology.</p>

6. A Description of Efforts Made to Ensure That Offers from as Many Potential Sources as Practicable and Whether a Notice Will Be Publicized:  This procurement was originally solicited as a SDVOSB competitive bid in Fiscal Year 2010.  All bids exceeded the Government estimate as well as the low bidder alleged a Mistake in Bid.
