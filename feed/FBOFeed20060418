<SUBJECT>B--Feasibility and Study Design for Boundary Oceanography of the Beaufort Sea
<SOLNBR>0106AN39710
<RESPDATE>052006
<ARCHDATE>04182007
<CONTACT>Kimberly Luke Contract Specialist 7037871339     kimberly.luke@mms.gov;
<DESC>The Minerals Management Service (MMS) of the Department of the Interior intends to competitively award a contract to conduct the study "Feasibility and Study Design for Boundary Oceanography of the Beaufort Sea."  This requirement is being issued in accordance with FAR 15.202.  PURPOSE: Review recommendations related to coastal, lateral, and offshore boundaries that control the circulation and water property fields in the Physical Oceanography of the Beaufort Sea Workshop report (OCS Study MMS 2003-045).  Provide MMS with study design and estimated costs for research project(s) to meet those recommendations.  Establish feasibility of co-sponsorships that respond to the specific recommendations and project designs.  The overall goal of the projects is to help MMS better understand the important physical processes of Beaufort Sea and to insure that first-order oceanic physics are understood and incorporated in MMS circulation models and oil spill risk analyses. BACKGROUND: In 2003, MMS sponsored an international workshop Physical Oceanography of the Beaufort Sea (BSW) to provide MMS with recommendations regarding future Arctic oceanographic research needs.  The BSW included presentations and discussions of international experts in Arctic oceanography on state-of-knowledge of Beaufort Sea physical oceanography and recommended long-range goals for oceanographic research to meet MMS needs.  Several of the workshop recommendations articulate the need to better understand the coastal boundary (buoyancy-forced coastal circulation), influences of lateral ocean boundaries, and dynamic controls of the offshore boundary.  Two MMS studies started in 2003 are now ongoing.  "Beaufort Sea Nearshore Currents" and "Mapping and Characterization of Recurring Spring Leads and Landfast Ice in the Beaufort Sea", address a portion of these recommendations.  However, other recommendations require more resources than MMS can provide alone.   PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED.   SCOPE OF WORK: In Task 1, the contractor shall hold a post-award conference in Anchorage with MMS staff to insure a clear understanding by all of study tasks, concerns, availability of relevant data and reports, and timelines.  The Contractor shall: provide a draft agenda to participants prior to the meeting, provide Meeting Summary to participants within one week of meeting, and list any changes needed to planned work as a result of the meeting.  In Task 2, the contractor will briefly review and summarize research completed or ongoing since 2003 that address specific BSW recommendations,  Evaluate whether any of the BSW recommendations can be considered met by new research.  In Task 3, review and evaluate improvements that may improve likelihood of success/lower cost.  These should include those available now or within the next few years.  Technology such as but not limited to remote sensing applications, High-frequency radar, and the proposed Barrow Observatory submarine cable should be considered.  In Task 4, develop strawman project profiles (realistic but brief project descriptions) that respond to Task 2 recommendations. Estimate costs to complete each study profile.  Profiles and estimated costs should be sufficiently detailed so as to serve as a primary introduction for potential partners during Task 5.  In Task 5, develop interagency contacts, expressions of interest, or agreements with other entities interested in cost or logistics sharing in Task 4 project objectives.  Prioritize specific objectives based on mutual interest, scientific gain, and logistical synergy/savings.  Consideration should be given to both using Task 4 projects as lead project or added objective to other Beaufort Sea programs/projects.  Revise Task 4 projects to fit within realistic, potential MMS or partnership support levels based on degree of success of this effort.  For Tasks 6 and 7, produce interim progress reports, draft and revised Final Report, and Technical Summary.   HOW TO RESPOND: In order to compete for this contract interested parties MUST demonstrate that they are qualified to perform the work by providing an original and four (4) copies of a Capabilities Statement detailing: (1) your key personnel (those who would have primary responsibility for performing and /or managing the study) with their qualifications and specific experience (2) your organizational experience and available facilities, (3) specific references (including contract number & project description, period of performance, dollar amount, client identification with the point of contact, telephone number, and email address) for previous work of this nature that your key personnel or organization has performed within the last two years.  If you believe the Government will find derogatory information as a result of checking your past performance record, please provide an explanation and any remedial action taken by your company to address the problem.  Following review and evaluation of all Capabilities Statements received, the Government will establish a list of those deemed best qualified to perform the work. Further details of proposal requirements and logistical considerations will be provided to those deemed best qualified at that time.   EVALUATION: Capability Statements will be evaluated based on: (A) demonstrated experience and expertise of all key technical personnel, especially as regards to their knowledge and experience in light of specific tasks to be performed. (B)The Project Manager's demonstrated leadership ability and experience with coordination and management of this type of effort, and ability to control costs and to keep project performance and deliverables on schedule.  (C) Demonstrated organizational history of successfully conducting projects of similar size, scope, complexity, duration, and dollar value; producing high-quality deliverables; and completing similar projects on schedule and within budget.  (D). Demonstration of adequate facilities to complete the tasks.

<DESC>When this project is complete, the Authority expects to:

1.	Have a complete, five-year DRA regional development plan, which establishes guiding principles, priorities and performance measures, then provides such information to each participating member state and each local development district overlapping the DRA footprint,

2.	Assist each participating member state with the development of its five-year, performance-based DRA development plan, to the point of approval by the DRA Board,

3.	In the development of both the DRA plan and each state’s plan, this process is to ensure that “local voices are heard” during the policy development process by using surveys, meetings, conferences, focus groups, and other outreach methods,

4.	Maintain programs which better coordinate federal and state investment and do not duplicate other programs, allowing DRA to seek and secure unique opportunities to complete “unfilled” grant niches,

5.	Partition the five-year outcome projection into five sets of annual outcome measures, Create and maintain effectiveness outcomes to a five-year horizon, which will form the vision to establish a “rolling five-year strategic plan” (PART), 

6.	On an annual basis, completely integrate its programs, policy initiatives, priorities, performance measures, budget and management,

7.	Utilize a performance-program budget system, where each function of the DRA’s organization will have personnel and resources explicitly tied to performance measures,

8.	Through the concept, DRA will coordinate with federal, state and local entities to emphasize sub-regional and region-wide economic development; while localized projects will always have a place in the DRA federal grant program, the Authority recognizes the need for regional projects – the region’s distressed communities are to improve their economic conditions,

9.	Encourage creation and use of “Regional Prosperity Alliances” (RPA) though the region’s local development districts and better integrate each LDD’s CEDS into the DRA planning processes and

10.	Provide economic development “tool kits” and “critical-mass benchmarks” to the sub-regions for their use in developing RPAs.

Marie, Ontario P6A 5K6, Canada to participate in the annual Waterfowl Breeding Pair Population Survey.  This survey is conducted to fulfill the United States's obligations toward International Mingratory Bird Treaty Act.  Waterfowl breeding populations will be surveyed within Ontario, Quebec and Labrador Canada to count waterfowl and collect  data.   Flights will be dependent on weather and waterfowl phenology.  Because the Ontarior Ministry of Natural Resourcs is a cooperative  governemnt agency, their helicopters are able to access jet fuel caches which are reserved for Government aircraft in remote areas. The helicopter flights are to be conducted in Stratum 51 in Ontario and Strata 68 and 69 in Quebec and Labrador Canada to obtain visibility correction data in conjuction with the Black Duck Joint Venture Fixed-wing Waterfowl Breeding Population Survey and to collect video for a training video.  The survey and identification project require maneuvering the helicopter at the edge of the performance envelope in a variety of remote wilderness habitats in nortern Canada.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The FAA intends to issue a contract for instructional support services for the Center for Management and Executive Learning (CMEL) located at Palm Coast, Florida, that consolidates three separate contracts currently awarded to a large business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business 8(a) SEDB/8(a) and a small business.  This announcement is a Market Survey/Request for Information.          The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from SBA Certified 8(a) and Small Business concerns.  The FAA is seeking interested sources that are capable of providing instructional and related support services to augment an existing CMEL staff in the completion of its tasked activities. CMEL is a resident training center that has a capacity of up to 200 residents that provides an average of approximately 55 field deliveries, 60 in-house conferences, and 163 resident deliveries per year. The FAA intends to have any resultant contract in place by May 2007.  The anticipated period of performance is one 12-month base period, with up to four (4) 12-month options. At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined. This market survey is being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to aid the FAA in its determination as to whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses (SEDB) that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program, or whether it is more appropriate to conduct this procurement using other Small Business competitive procurement procedures.  The principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 611710, with a size standard of $6.5 Million.  Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA SEDB 8(a) Certification letter (if applicable).  Interested sources are required to provide responses as identified in the attached Market Survey (5 pages).  The survey describes the tasks and services, and identifies the information to be submitted in response to this announcement.

<DESC>During the paint stipping process, storage tanks maintained by 309 CMXG/QPL fill with a significant quantity of paint, solids, and debris that must be removed from the paint stripping solution.  To remove this debris, the paint stripping solution must be descanted, solids must be removed, and and the usable solution must be returned to the tanks.

This “recycling” process allows the facility to reutilize the solution, which reduces process cost as well as disposal costs/liability.  

These proprietary chemicals cannot be mixed with other brands of chemical.  Switching brands now would require that 6000 gallons of existing paint stripper be drained and disposed.  Because the material is hazardous, disposal will be time consuming and costs will be considerable.  Additional costs will be incurred in lost production.  Draining and refilling storage tanks can take several weeks to months to complete.  The entire production process will be shut down unil the storage tanks can be filled.  Changing chemicals will therefore result in substantial duplication of costs that are not expected to be recovered through price competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency’s requirements.

<DESC>Construction Services - The General Services Administration (GSA) Great Lakes Region announces an opportunity for construction services for the complete demolition and build-out of office space on the 29th floor of the A.J. Celebrezze Federal Building located on 1240 E. Ninth St. in Cleveland, Ohio. The work on the 29th floor includes build out of a new elevator lobby and public corridor, upgrades to the fire life safety systems and installation of a new HVAC system. Also included in this project is the renovation of public restrooms on approximately ten floors throughout the building. The estimated cost of this project falls within the range of $1.0 million to $5.0 million, with an anticipated project duration of approximately fourteen (14) months. The construction portion of the project is estimated to begin April  2006. 


A qualified contractor will be selected using a Two-step, No-go “Low Price Technically Acceptable” (LPTA) source selection procedure, in accordance with Part 15 of the FAR.  Moreover, this will be a lump sum, fixed-price contract not set aside for small businesses. During step one of the Two-step LPTA, offers will be evaluated against the Go/No-go qualification factors.  Proposals found to be acceptable will then move on to step two of the evaluation process, during which price proposals will be opened and evaluated.  It is the Government’s intention to award the project to the lowest-priced bidder.  The bidder must also meet the Government’s standards of responsiveness and responsibility.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct negotiations if it is in its best interest to do so.

All elements of work to be executed must be within the congressionally mandated cost limitations. The contractor will be required to correct all deficiencies identified by the Government (or in its own quality control review) relating to the completeness or accuracy of the work, compliance with the contract, and compliance with any applicable laws or regulations.  The services procured under this contract will conform to the quality requirements in the specification.  Any Government furnished information relating to this acquisition will be distributed to parties after an award.  After an award, quality control will also include inspection, acceptance, warranty and other measures associated with quality requirements.  The contractor is not required to provide data or service for any of the systems that will be installed during this project.  Only typical inspection, training, acceptance, warranty and other requirements normally associated with our standard construction contracts will apply.  

Small Business Participation: This is a procurement open to both large and small business concerns. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 236220 with a small business size standard of $28.5 million. Although this procurement is not set aside for small businesses, small firms including women-owned, minority-owned, HUBZone, veteran-owned, and service disabled veteran-owned business are strongly encouraged to participate in this project. In accordance with 15 USC 631, large businesses will be required to provide these small firms the maximum practical opportunities to participate as subcontractors in the performance of this contract. Each large firm will be required to submit an acceptable subcontracting plan that meets, and preferably exceeds, the minimum acceptable subcontracting target goals established by the Small Business Administration (SBA). An acceptable subcontracting plan must be reviewed and approved by the SBA prior to award of this contract. Small businesses are not subject to this requirement. However, all firms seeking consideration for this contract will need to demonstrate a proactive effort to achieve the highest possible subcontracting goals for local business participation. Contractors will submit a written narrative (limited to one typed written page) along with their offers that outlines their outreach efforts made to utilize local firms. In order to receive the benefit of a price evaluation preference as a HUBZone small business concern, firms must be certified by the SBA. Please refer to the SBA website at www.sba.gov for details.

Joint Ventures: Joint ventures or firm/consultant arrangements will be considered and evaluated on a demonstrated interdependency of the members to provide a quality CMc team effort.

<DESC>The Cataloging and Distribution Service of the Library of Congress intends to make a sole-source firm-fixed price award to the incumbent, Minaret Corporation for a base and three option years, for the use of Minaret Web v.3.0 software, customized to provide the external library community with access to Library of Congress Classification schedules and correlations to Library of Congress Subject Headings. 
 
The Library of Congress uses the Minaret software system for the creation, update, and searching of MARC classification records; and for supporting external distribution products that provide access to Library of Congress Classification data in both MARC format and in the required hierarchical display, with correlations to Library of Congress Subject Headings. 
 
The Library of Congress intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the statutory authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1); the regulatory authority is FAR 6.302-(1).  Award is anticipated on or about 15 May 2006. 
 
It is the Library’s belief that Minaret Corporation is the only contractor presently qualified to provide this critical software without significant interruption of the operations of the Library's online classification system, and/or significant duplication of effort and cost to the Government. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, any other company that (1) is either legally incorporated as a U.S. business entity, or is capable of demonstrating through its business plan its intention to be fully incorporated as a U.S. business; and (2) believes it can meet the performance requirements of the specifications noted above without significant interruption of the operations of the Library's online classification system, and without significant duplication of effort and cost to the Government, is invited to apply to the Library for consideration.  All written proposals including capabilities/facilities statements and past performance summaries that are received within fifteen (15) days of the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement, and a determination not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice remains solely within the discretion of the Government.

This is a broad, community-specific market survey to locate sources for supply of numerous avionics items that are currently in short supply within the Army and are needed immediatel y to support Army Aviation. In many cases, OEM suppliers are unable to produce sufficient quantities to meet our current needs. Thus, we are interested in buying assets from alternative sources. Depending upon specific circumstances for the items in questi on, we might be interested in buying new stock, new old stock, reconditioned items, or, in some cases, unserviceable items. In some cases, this material may have been purchased by suppliers as surplus equipment. Depending upon respondents capabilities and  the current status of our organic depot repair programs, we might be interested in having the supplier perform refurbishment, repair, overhaul. Alternatively, we might want to buy the unserviceable assets and induct these into ongoing organic repair progr ams that are operating below capacity because of the longstanding paucity of unserviceable returns from the field. Regardless of specific circumstances, any company that possesses ANY significant quantity of Army avionics is encouraged to respond with info rmation regarding those assets that they have available. We have a list of key NSNs of interest that will be provided via e-mail upon request. We are looking for hardware assets, not repair services. Companies capable of performing this effort may respond by writing to: Commander, USA CECOM, ATTN: AMSEL-LC-CCS-N-AN (MICHAEL E. HARRIS), Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703-5403 or alternatively, contact us via e-mail at: EMAIL ADDRESS avionics@mail1.monmouth.army.mil.

While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command. This requirement is for a Firm Fixed-Price contract for the acquisition of two (2) complete Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs) and any Ground Control System (GCS) components, other than standard personal computers, that are required to operate both UAVs simultaneously in an autonomous manner.  The two UAVs, GCS hardware and software, GCS development licenses, and all associated documentation will be referred to as the UAV System.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is a Request for Proposals (RFP); the solicitation number is N00178-06-R-3034.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-16.  This item will be acquire!  d through full and open competition.  The associated standard industrial classification code is 3721; the Small Business Size Standard is 1,500 employees.  This requirement is set aside 100 percent for participation by small business concerns.  Note 1 will apply.  DESCRIPTION:  A. UAV Requirements:  1.  General Flight Requirements: The UAVs shall be capable of powered flight and shall have autonomous take-off and landing capability from a paved, 500 ft. runway, with a full payload and fuel load.  The UAV shall be capable of achieving a minimum altitude of 5000 ft. within 15 minutes after takeoff on a day with 80% relative humidity, and 85 degree F, ambient temperature.. The UAV shall have available payload capacity of at least twenty pounds at maximum take-off weight.  The available payload capacity shall fit in a cavity within the UAV and shall be accessible from the bottom of the UAV with removal of simple fasteners. The payload bay shall provide attachment points, space,!   and power for installing a BAI Aero Systems Mini-66 type sensor. The  UAVs shall each be equipped with landing gear that provides clearance of at least four inches between the bottom of the installed Mini-66 type sensor and the ground.   Auxiliary space of .75 Cubic feet and 300 Watts of 12 VDC power shall be provided for customer installed equipment.  The UAV shall be capable of carrying enough fuel and have sufficient battery power to provide a flight duration of at least 90 minutes with a full, 20 lb. payload (or a 20 lb. ballast weight) installed.  2.  Video and Communications Requirements: The UAV shall have a fixed focal length, fixed view, auto iris video camera with at least 640 X 480 (1024 X 1024 preferred) pixel 12-bit color resolution. The fixed view camera shall be oriented to provide a forward looking (Pilot’s) view and shall be capable of +/- 35 degrees in azimuth and elevation in reference to the aircraft centerline.  The UAV video shall be transmitted to and displayed on the GCS on a radio frequency in any of the commercial or !  shared frequency bands between 902 and 10005 Mhz.  Each UAV shall transmit its video on a separate channel to avoid cross-talk of the two video signals.  The UAV shall have a full duplex command and control transceiver operating in any of the commercial or shared frequency bands between 902 and 10005 Mhz. This transceiver shall receive and transmit data to and from an equivalent transceiver supplied by the vendor as part of the GCS equipment. The transceiver pair, with vendor supplied antennas, shall be capable of at least a 20 mile line of sight range in clear weather.  3. Autopilot Requirements: The UAVs shall have full autonomous autopilot capability to include automatic heading, speed, altitude, pitch, roll, and yaw control.  The autopilot subsystem shall be capable of receiving a flight path defined by a minimum of 1000 waypoints in standard Global Positioning System (GPS) format (WGS-84).  The autopilots shall be capable of in-flight waypoint programming in order to s!  upport ground based UAV flight path control.  The autopilot shall also  perform error-checking on newly received waypoints from the GCS prior to application and/or execution. If an error is detected by the autopilot on receipt of a waypoint set update, the autopilot shall not implement the received waypoint set and shall transmit an error message to the GCS.  Each autopilot shall be capable of transmitting the UAV’s current GPS position, its current speed setting, heading, and altitude setting to the GCS at least once every two seconds.  Additional data transmission to the GCS is also acceptable.  The autopilot shall also be outfitted with a commercial radio control receiver so that emergency control from a ground based operator using a standard Futaba-like radio, can be achieved at short ranges.  In the event of a communications failure between the UAV and the GCS, the UAV shall be capable of executing a pre-planned, pre-defined maneuver, autonomously. The maneuver capability shall include an autonomous landing capability at the takeoff point,!   or at another pre-defined point. The pre-planned maneuver shall be capable of being loaded into the UAV autopilot prior to takeoff.  The UAV shall utilize a dual-frequency (L1 and L2), active GPS antenna with a minimum 40 db gain.  The autopilot shall provide at least one RS-232 pass through for use by the customer as a payload control channel.  4. Telemetry Requirements: Each UAV shall be capable of transmitting to the GCS, relevant real-time flight data, to include at a minimum: current GPS time, position, position error estimates, velocity and velocity error estimates, attitude data (heading, roll, and pitch and components’error estimates) current speed/throttle setting, engine RPM, Fuel and Battery/generator status. All data items shall be transmitted to the GCS in at least 10 bits of resolution, at a minimum rate of 5 times per second.  5. Optional Flight Termination System: The vendor supplied UAVs shall each be equipped with a reusable flight termination system (FTS!  ).  The FTS shall operate on a separate communications channel from th e command and control channel. The FTS shall have a minimum range of operation of 20 miles, line of sight. The FTS, when actuated, shall cause the UAV to cut its engine and gracefully return to earth. The FTS shall include a stand-alone transmitter unit capable of sending a flight termination signal to the UAV at up to 20 miles, line of sight distance. The vendor shall provide equipment and supplies sufficient to allow the buyer to re-charge and re-use the FTS at least five times. The bidder shall price this item separately from the rest of the UAV system.  6. Operating Requirements: The UAV shall operate on fuel that is either commercially available or already in the US Navy supply chain. The UAV shall be capable of being de-fueled completely within 30 minutes of engine shutoff.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Bosch Rexroth Canada Corp, 3426 Mainway Drive, Burlington, Ontario for the acquisition of one (1) custom Hydraulic Power Supply (P/N Q0512400A).  This equipment is needed for the Carriage, Stream, Tow, and Recovery System (CSTRS) deployed aboard the MH-60S helicopter.  This procurement is sole source for the following reasons.  The Bosch Rexroth Canada Hydraulic Power Supply is the only equipment compatible with test fixtures manufactured by ODIM Spectrum as part of their contracted effort (N61331-06-P-0513).   The selection of alternate equipment would result in a redesign of the test fixtures with a resulting schedule cost impact to the Government far in excess of any cost savings that could be accrued through open competition.  Therefore it is imperative that this equipment is acquired from Bosch Rexroth immediately.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
Nationwide Sales and Distribution of Xerographic Paper


The United States Government Printing Office (GPO) is seeking a vendor to expand the services the GPO provides to its Federal agency customers in the area of sales and distribution of xerographic copy paper.  This Request for Information (RFI) seeks information on the capabilities of paper distributors or resellers in the area of xerographic paper sales, marketing of xerographic paper to Federal agencies, on-line order taking and fulfillment of orders from Federal agencies and the delivery of paper to Federal agencies throughout the United States, on behalf of the GPO.

GPO annually purchases paper for its own use and for the use of other Federal agencies.  Pursuant to Section 1121, Title 44, United States Code, the GPO is a source of supply for printing and copier paper used by Federal agencies in the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Area.  The total amount of office paper purchased by GPO for its own use and for the use of federal agencies is approximately $7.5 million per year.  Of this total, approximately $5 million is xerographic copy paper.  GPO is planning to expand the marketing and delivery of paper beyond the Washington D.C. area, to encompass the entire continental United States.

The GPO’s objective is to improve the services the GPO provides to its Federal agency customers and to improve the ability of Government agencies to order xerographic copier paper from GPO.  Currently the GPO provides a full catalog of printing, duplicating and copying paper products to various Federal agencies.  The GPO also provides a full array of functions and activities to complete the xerographic copy paper cycle from wholesale to final use.  These include contracting, selection, quality assurance, pricing, promotion, delivery schedules, intake, delivery, support, and customer relations.  GPO is seeking a vendor to develop, host and maintain a website to be accessible by Federal government agencies to place orders for xerographic copy paper. The vendor will then be responsible for delivering paper (ranging in quantities from skid loads to a single carton) to ordering agencies throughout the continental United States.  The vendor must maintain a minimum delivery schedule of same day or next day for the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Area and other major metropolitan areas.  The provided paper will be subject to testing by GPO’s paper testing laboratory and must meet the requirements outlined in GPO’s qualified products list.  

Keeping GPO’s goals in mind, please outline how your organization would perform these services.  Services may include but are not limited to the following: inventory acquisition and management, sales, marketing, on-line store, order processing and fulfillment, customer support, storage, and delivery.  

Vendors are hereby requested to submit a statement detailing the approach they would take to perform the services listed above.  Special attention should be paid to the following key ideas in your responses:

1.	How will you advance GPO's mission of providing xerographic copy paper to Federal agencies located throughout the United States? 
2.	What are some innovative ideas you will implement to enhance the overall marketing, fulfillment and distribution of xerographic copy paper to Federal agencies? 
3.	What mechanisms and metrics would you use to confirm the timeliness and accuracy of paper deliveries? 
4.	Given the approaches that you have described above, what sort of contractual relationship do you anticipate having with GPO and what form of revenue sharing or compensation do you foresee?  In addition, how would you propose to measure industry-wide paper price changes and to adjust the contract price to reflect those changes?
5.	Why do you feel that your company is especially qualified for this opportunity?

This announcement is a request for information only and does not obligate the GPO in any way.  This is not a request for proposals and the GPO will not pay for any information submitted or for any expenses associated with providing information.

Responses to this notice should be sent in triplicate to Sheree Young, Supervisory Contract Specialist, Acquisition Services, U.S. Government Printing Office, Room A332, Mail Stop: CSAS, 732 North Capitol Street, NW, Washington, DC 20401, or by email to syoung@gpo.gov.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   This is a combined synopsis/request for quote (RFQ) for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The identifying RFQ number is RFQ-OH-06-00118.  The RFQ and incorporated provisions/clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-08.   A firm fixed price purchase order is anticipated to result from the award of this RFQ.   The NAICS code is 541710, and the size standard is 500 employees.   STATEMENT OF WORK Dispersion of Crude Oil  and Petroleum Products in Freshwater I.  Period of Performance:   14 months from date of award.  II.  Background and Objectives:  Dispersants are not used to treat oil spills in freshwater in the U.S.  This is partly due to the absence of dispersants that are effective in freshwater on the NCP  Product Schedule and partly due to the perception that dispersion of oil in freshwater would cause unacceptable harm to valuable resources (e.g., public water supplies, endangered species).  In addition, there appears to be a perception that dispersants cannot work in freshwater, but this may be  due (at least in part) to attempts to use dispersants that were optimized for use in seawater.  At least six commercial dispersants have been approved for freshwater use in France. So, it may be possible to optimize dispersant formulations to promote effectiveness in freshwater.  The environmental  consequences of oil-spill dispersion will be determined in part by the dilution potential of the affected water body and partly by the long-term fate of the dispersed oil (e.g., stability of the dispersed oil droplets, biodegradation rate, and tendency to interact with sediments and other  surfaces).  Since several important water bodies (e.g., the Mississippi River, the Great Lakes) have sufficient dilution potential to accommodate dispersion of relatively large oil spills, a blanket prohibition against the use of dispersants in freshwater may be ill advised. Oil dispersants consist  of one or more surfactants dissolved in a compatible solvent.  Surfactants are amphipathic molecules that contain hydrophilic and hydrophobic (or lipophilic) regions that interact with water and oil, respectively.  The presence of hydrophilic and hydrophobic functional groups in the same molecule  causes surfactants to accumulate at the oil-water interface and lower the interfacial tension, which reduces the energy required to create new interfacial area.  For nonionic surfactants, the relative contributions of the hydrophilic and lipophilic regions to the properties of the molecule can be  quantified by the hydrophile:lipophile balance (HLB).  The HLB can vary from 0 (100% lipophilic) to 20 (100% hydrophilic).  Most commercial dispersants have an HLB in the range of 9 to 11 (Clayton et al., 1993).  Dispersants that are optimized for use in seawater tend to have HLBs greater than 10,  but optimal performance in freshwater requires the HLB to be less than 10.  The desired HLB can be obtained using a single surfactant or by mixing two or more surfactants with HLBs lower and higher than the desired average value.  The latter approach is believed to more effective because it allows  closer packing of the surfactant molecules at the oil-water interface (Porter, 1991). The objective of this research is to investigate the relationship between dispersant composition and effectiveness of dispersion of fresh and weathered crude oil in freshwater.  The effectiveness of several  commercial dispersants, that are purported to be effective in freshwater, will be evaluated and compared to mixtures of surfactants with known composition.   III.  Tasks Task 1:  Development of QAPP   Within 15 business days after award, a Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) shall be submitted  to the EPA Project Officer (PO) in accordance with EPA's quality assurance guidelines for a basic research project plan (attached). The contractor shall comply with all the requirements as delineated in the section entitled NRMRL's Quality System Specifications on Attachment #1.  Following the  review by the EPA PO/QAQC Office, specific comments will be provided to the Contractor.  The contractor shall revise the QAPP in accordance with the changes identified by the PO. Task 2:   Development of Freshwater Dispersants.  The Contractor shall determine the oil-dispersion effectiveness of  surfactant mixtures with a range of HLBs using the EPA's Baffled-Flask Test (BFT) as the standard operating condition (the detailed procedure for the BFT will be provided by the EPA PO). The surfactant mixtures shall consist of combinations of common commercially available surfactants of the  Contractor's choosing. The composition of the surfactant mixture shall be systematically varied to determine the optimal composition.  An important difference between seawater and freshwater is that, in general, the interfacial tension between a specific oil and freshwater is greater than the  interfacial tension between the same oil and seawater.  Therefore, it is important that the Contractor also determine whether the effectiveness of dispersion in freshwater and seawater can be independently predicted by the oil-water interfacial tension (i.e., are the relationships between  dispersion effectiveness and interfacial tension similar in seawater and freshwater or does interfacial tension affect dispersion effectiveness differently depending on the water characteristics?). Specific formulations of artificial seawater and freshwater (1 formulation for each) will be provided  to the Contractor by the EPA PO.  IV.  Reporting Procedures:   The contractor shall provide detailed monthly reports describing progress made in each task. The Contractor shall provide to the EPA PO the raw data as they become available. At the end of the 12 month period, the Contractor shall  summarize all the data developed over the course of the year and deliver its summary to the PO in the form of a draft report or journal article.  The draft report or journal article shall be sent electronically to the PO, in Mirosoft Word format.  The report shall detail the methods used and the  results from all tests performed and provide recommendations for additional work that complement this work.  V.  Deliverables: (1)  Quality Assurance Project Plan submitted to PO within 15 days after award.  (2)  Draft report shall be submitted to the EPA PO NLT 30 days following the end of the  12-month research period. The PO will review the draft and provide appropriate  comments/changes. Such comments/changes shall be submitted to the EPA PO in a final report, NLT 30 days prior to the end of the order.  (3)  Monthly reports detailing progress. References: Clayton, J.R., Jr., J.R.

<DESC>Presolicitation Notice - Solicitation will be available in May.

Grazing control of yellow starthistle.  This contract is to provide approximately 1000 head of yearling goats (or older) with herders, guard and herd dogs, to control 800-1000 acres of yellow starthistle in a study area on lower Bentz Ridge, Northeast of White Bird Idaho, on the Nez Perce National Forest.  The project area is an open steep grassland slope bounded on the south by South Fork White Bird Creek and Pinnacle Creek.  The North boundary consists of Bentz Ridge.  The objective is to shrink the target weed population extent and density, and reduce seed production of this Idaho noxious weed by 90% while maintaining desirable vegetation.  Grazing would occur during two prescriptive periods: 30 days during the bolting/early-flower phase of yellowstar (June-July) and an additional 30 days, if necessary, in the fall prior to seed scatter (October).  Camp access and management would require the use of an ATV or Pack animals along Bentz Ridge.  The contractor will need to provide a set of portable watering troughs to draft water from White Bird Creek, and to arrange for pasture or feed outside the prescriptive season and off the National Forest.  The animals brought to the National Forest must have been managed as a herd for at least 6 months prior to turn-on.

Contract completion date is anticipated to be in November 2006.

<DESC>AUGER ELECTRON SPECTROSCOPY (AES) SYSTEM--
The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is undertaking a project to integrate processing, deposition and analysis tools for studying photovoltaic materials and devices.  All tools will be built to accommodate a platen that is 7” × 7” square, capable of accommodating substrates up to 6” × 6”.  The equipment will be installed in the new Science and Technology Facility at NREL. 

One of the first analysis tools to be purchased by NREL for this project will be a Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) system.  NREL envisions an instrument that will be compact, mobile, highly automated, and capable of being interfaced to other vacuum systems. The capability for sputter depth profiling is required. Mapping is desirable but not mandatory. The system should be able to access all areas on the 6x6 in2 sample. Typically the AES tool will be docked to a robotic cluster tool, but it should also be capable of standalone operation.   

If you are interested in receiving the full set of specifications for the AES system in a formal Request for Proposal from NREL, please submit your contact information only to the following no later than May 3, 2006:

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity proposes to award to Cepheid, 904 Caribbean Drive, Sunnyvale, CA 94089-1302, on a sole source basis, for the purchase a Smartcyler System 1 unit upgrade LS, Part No. SC2500N3-1, manufactured solely by  Cepheid. The Smartcycler is the only system that will meet the Governments requirements.  Competing this requirement and awarding to any other manufacturer and system would result in substantial delays and disruption of several key projects already in pr ogress and would also increase the overall cost to the Government.  This procurement shall be under other than full and open competition procedures in accordance with FAR 6.302.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy ag ency requirements.  This notice is not a request for a competitive quote.  Any response to this notice must be submitted in writing to the Government and show clear and convincing evidence that another system is capable of meeting the Governments requirem ents and that competition of the requirement would be advantageous to the Government.  If no written responses are received at least fifteen (15) days after the publication of this response, the purchase will be awarded without further notice.  The Point o f Contact (POC) for this action is:  lottie.morris@amedd.army.mil.

<DESC>Objective: To support and advance the business processes of Headquarters, USAREURs International Operations Division through enhanced planning and automation support; provision of on-call political-military expertise on selected countries and region s; integration of arms control reporting requirements; requirements definition through interactive conferences and seminars; and automation of military-to-military (mil-to-mil) activities.    Specific Tasks.      a.  Task 1, Office Automation Support.           (1) As directed by IOD, the contactor will provide database management and data input support, to include maintaining the website and existing database software, as well as inputting data required by EUCOM and DA theater security cooperation auto mation systems.  The contractor shall provide the following capabilities to support this task: ·	Perform requirements analysis, conceptualize, design and evaluate information management systems to automate IOD staff procedures, arms control reporting requirements, and planning for international military engagement activities.  Develop and tailor aut omation programs to support office operations and websites on the unclassified and classified networks using existing Microsoft software suite (Word, Excel, etc.).           (2) The contractor shall provide user training and assistance to IOD staff on the operation of existing and contractor developed management tools and databases, including the two websites, Theater Security Cooperation database input, Mil-to-Mil a nd Pol-Mil databases. Contractor assistance shall be made available on-site in the IOD division. Historically, one employee on site with reach-back capability to the company has been sufficient.  Additionally, contractor shall perform routine maintenance, troubleshooting and upgrades on its management tools and database to ensure compatibility of its systems with IOD hardware and software for the duration of the contract.       b.  Task 2, Regional Stability Operations Information Assessments.                (a) Contractor will provide planning support for USAREURs programs supporting various theater security cooperation contact programs in accordance with the Vienna Document (99). IOD has recurring demands for political-military, economic and  defense program analysis to evaluate the allocation of USAREUR resources to these regional stability operations. The contractor must be able to analyze USAREURs external environment (e.g. political climate, economic and social trends, legislation, custom er demand/expectations, changes and advancements in technology, emerging technology trends, and competitive conditions) to determine its effects and relationship on advancing the goals and direction of USAREUR operations. The contractor must be able to res pond with timely and frequently updated specialized technical military evaluations that can be formatted either into operations plans/orders or electronically transmitted to USAREURs forward support teams and forward deployed Operational Command Posts (OC P). This data will support headquarters functions of managing information and data related to planning and programming future regional stability country outreach programs. As appropriate, data and evaluations developed under this task will be submitted int o appropriate databases developed under paragraph 1a(1), Task 1 above.  Historically, this task has been performed by a combination of on-site personnel research efforts and reach-back support.                 (b) On a task order basis, the Contractor will research and analyze information resources on a country-by-country, regional or subject basis for individual study projects covering the 91 nations within the USAREUR Area of Interest (AOI).  Th e Government will provide the specific requirement to the contractor, who will respond with a firm fixed price proposal for that specific requirement.  If accepted by the Government, the task order will be fin alized as a firm fixed price order.  In order to deliver appropriate products, the contractor must have an understanding of USAREURs regional stability and theater security cooperation (TSC) operations and be able to customize information provided to supp ort ongoing and planned regional stability and TSC operations. Because the military, political climate, legislation, economic and social trends can change with great frequency in many nations in the USAREURs AOI, USAREUR may require specific political-mil itary and individual country expertise to provide pertinent information on an as-needed, as-ordered basis. Due to the volatility of the information contained in country resource projects or specific mission requirements, and often unforeseen changes in USA REUR operational priorities, USAREUR Contracting Officer Representative (COR) will issue such requests as separate, individual task orders.  When such products are requested, the Contractor will provide draft copies of each product to IOD for review prior to delivery of final version.       c.  Task 3, CG USAREURs Annual Strategic Research Program. This program includes the preparation and conduct of workshops, conferences, CG Senior Officer Training, and Officer Professional Development meetings focused on collecting and analyzing data  related to the technical military environment in Europe and impact of regional stability operations in the countries within the USAREUR AOI. The CG-hosted annual Conference of European Armies (CEA) focusing on a topic of special interest to the command is  central to this research program. Data and analysis resulting from the Strategic Research Program provides USAREUR senior leadership and staff with a better understanding of their complex technical military operating environment, and is integral to USAREU Rs regional stability and TSC operations.           (1) The contractor shall prepare and conduct the annual USAREUR-sponsored Conference of European Armies (CEA) on a topic of special interest to the command. The contractor will conduct analysis of USAREURs strategic environment and provide topic  recommendations to IOD no later than 1 November annually. The research conference should be planned for 75 persons in Heidelberg, Germany, and includes: ·	Not later than 1 December annually, the contractor will deliver an approach plan containing a proposed conference agenda, a timetable, list of conference subjects, proposed presenters, and proposed invitation list for approval by Headquarters, USAREUR. T his approach plan may also include proposed dates and subject agendas for two smaller but related and/or complementary research workshops. ·	Upon acceptance of the agenda, timetable, list of conference subjects, proposed presenters, and proposed invitation list, the contractor will contact proposed presenters to ascertain their availability and willingness to participate. The contractor shall  extend informal invitations to proposed presenters, as appropriate. Formal invitations will be issued by USAREUR. ·	Prepare and distribute appropriate support materials, such as brochures, agenda, conference schedule, administrative and substantive guidelines, and list of attendees.  In addition, reproduce and distribute to participants the post-conference CD-ROM prov ided by the Government.  Historically, three contractor personnel have supported the execution of the conference on a temporary duty basis; one individual for four weeks and two other individuals for two weeks. ·	Arrange for all conference logistics support, to include transportation, accommodations, meals, dinner/banquet, and on-site support. For each workshop and conference the contractor will plan a reception and meals. In addition, this may include such arran gements as an off-site informal dinner, simultaneous translation service, on-site audio-visual support, and computer support.  The costs for these items will be reimbursed separate from the firm fixed price portion of this contract. ·	Develop a written report to be delivered to Headquarters, USAREUR within 60 days of the research conference. The report shall, at a minimum, provide a synopsis of the conference presentations and discussions. ·	Establish and maintain budget and cost control procedures for costs reimbursable by the government as specified in this task, tasks 4 and 5, and as specified in the Special Contract Requirements below.           (2) On a task order basis, the contractor may be tasked to conduct one research workshop annually related to the conference described in Task 3(1). The research workshop will be designed by the contractor to prepare for, follow-up, or complement the CEA research conference. For the research workshop, deliverables include items identified in Task 3(1).  The research workshop shall be planned for 50 persons for a period of up to 4 days at a location within the USAREUR AOI. Timing, location, and cont ent of the workshops require prior IOD approval.  Since costs for the location and logistics support for this subtask are variable (as they are for CEA above), the costs for the logistical support will be reimbursed separate from the firm fixed price for t he basic contract.           (3) Cost for research conference/workshop meals are allowable on a reimbursable basis, including government employees on TDY who will be instructed to forfeit reimbursement. Selected senior U.S. government personnel performing a substantive role may have all costs allowable, including air travel, on the basis that they will not apply for any reimbursement. Payment of speaker fees and honoraria to selected key speakers (e.g, retired flag officers and other non-U.S. Government experts performing a s ubstantive role at the conference) is allowable.  Costs under these subtasks are variable and, once approved in advance by the COR, are reimbursable separate from the firm fixed price for the basic contract.        d.  Task 4, Monthly Reports.  The contractor shall provide monthly cost and technical status reports of work in progress. Review of status of tasks including problems and corrective action taken/recommended will be addressed. The costs portion of the report will provide a list of obligations incurred for items reimbursable by the government under this contract, as well as a projection of such costs for the remainder of the contract year. These reports will be provided by the 15th day of each month to t he Contracting Officer Representative (COR) and will cover the activities of the previous month and anticipated work of the next month.  In addition, the contractor shall provide a separate budget status report directly to the COR when 75% of the budget is  obligated; this report shall be submitted within two weeks of obligating 75%.       e.  Task 5, In-Progress Reviews.  The contractor project manager shall meet with the COR and IOD personnel on a semi-annual basis to review contractor performance, costs and budget status during the proceeding six-months and identify any adjustments o r modification in the statement of work and budget necessary to accomplish activities planned for the coming six month period.  In addition, the project manager shall be responsive to the COR 24 hours a day, every day of the contract.

<DESC>SEE AMENDMENT 4 in FedBizOpps for Solicitation No. 678-0076-06, furnish all labor, material, equipment, and supervision to complete Project No. 678-313, Research Wet Labs at the Southern Arizona VA Health Care System, 3601 S. 6th Avenue, Tucson, AZ 85730. This acquisition is 100% set-aside for eligible 8(a) firms. 8(a) firms must meet the Small Business Administrations (SBA) criterion, and have previously been certified by the SBA as an 8(a) firm, which have a NAICS Code 236220 having a size standard of $28.5 million average annual receipts for the preceding three (3) fiscal years. Joint Ventures are allowable on competitive 8(a) set-asides. The Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) and all supporting documents (i.e., tax returns, financial statements, narratives, checklists etc.) must be submitted as soon as possible but no less than twenty (20) working days prior to the scheduled date for contract award. Incomplete packages will be returned without action. The Joint Venture Agreement must be approved by SBA prior to award of any resulting contract. Failure to obtain SBAs approval of the JVA prior to award will result in SBAs request to the buying activity to terminate the award. Offers from concerns other than 8(a) will not be considered. The general description of work includes construction of a new free-standing research laboratory building. This building is approximately 6,400 gross square feet, slab-on grade, single-story construction with a reinforced concrete foundation and masonry exterior walls with a built-up low-pitch roof. A new equipment yard of approximately 1,650 square feet is to be constructed adjacent to the new building. Also included is construction of a vertical circulation addition to the south end of the existing Building 6 (nearby the new building site), as well as selective renovation and building service and utility upgrades. Building 6 contains approximately 12,500 square feet of occupiable space. The selective renovation pertains primarily to building and fire code deficiencies. The project includes a significant amount of underground utility work (most utilities are privately-owned) associated with the new building construction, the construction of the vertical circulation addition, and with new building services. Asbestos abatement (flooring, pipe insulation, crawlspace earth excavation, and exterior finish) is included in the project scope. During selective demolition, worker protection, handling and disposal of lead-based painted materials will be required. Phases of work will be staggered to provide for completion of all work roughly around the same time and to minimize the amount of time that various sections of Building 6 will need to be vacant. Part of Building 6 (existing labs on the north section of the first floor) will remain occupied during the work, requiring the utility work in this area to be accomplished during hours that can be accommodated by the tenants (primarily evenings and weekends). Contract award is subject to availability of funds. Performance period is 495 calendar days after Notice to Proceed. Project Magnitude is between $2,000,000 and $5,000,000. Issue Date was 4/12/06.  Pre-Bid Conference/Site Visit is scheduled on 5/17/06 at 9:30 a.m. Offer due date is 6/27/06 by 3:00 p.m. local time. Solicitation documents and amendments will be available for download on the VA Business Opportunitites Website or the Fed Biz Opps website. Paper copies of the solicitation will not be issued. Any and all question regarding this solicitation shall be in writing and sent to the Contracting Officer. NOTE: Solicitation is currently being reviewed by Legal and Technical and all information identified above is subject to change.

<DESC>This modification provides answers to questions submitted on 4/14 and 4/17.


1.  After visiting the site, there seems to be many more cracks in the pavement than is indicated on the plans. Is our bid to be based on the quantities and locations shown on the drawings or are we responsible for a complete crack repair in all areas that currently exist. 

Response:  
The bidder is to include in his base bid the cost to clean and seal coat 7225 square yards of existing pavement and to clean and repair 3500 linear feet of cracked pavement. In addition, the bidder is to provide unit costs for both items in accordance with Specification Section 01200 1.8.G.2. As each area is released to the contractor an existing conditions survey will be conducted to verify the extent of repairs required.  The contract price will be adjusted according to the add/deduct unit prices based on the actual extent of the repairs to be completed as directed by the COR.

2.  Does any of the existing pipe insulation contain asbestos?
Response:
The Asbestos Survey and Evaluation for the USDA New York Animal Import Center at Rock Tavern Prepared by NTH Consultants on September 23, 2002 concluded that no asbestos containing materials was present on the plumbing piping.
 
Questions still to be answered.

1) Engine Generators - Is a permanent load bank really required with the generator or is this just  for startup testing?

2) Is electrical piping for interior work EMT?

3) Is buried conduit PVC (from Pole P11 to transformer/generator)?

AN ANNOUNCMENT WILL BE POSTED IN THE NEAR FUTURE WITH THE RFP RELEASE DATE AND PROPOSAL DUE DATE. PLEASE CONTINUE TO CHECK BACK OFTEN AS WE INTEND TO RELEASE THE RFP SOMETIME SOON. <p></B><P> *****************************************************************************************************************<P>Construction Services - The General Services Administration (GSA) Great Lakes Region announces an opportunity for construction services for the complete demolition and build-out of office space on the 29th floor of the A.J. Celebrezze Federal Building located on 1240 E. Ninth St. in Cleveland, Ohio. The work on the 29th floor includes build out of a new elevator lobby and public corridor, upgrades to the fire life safety systems and installation of a new HVAC system. Also included in this project is the renovation of public restrooms on approximately ten floors throughout the building. The estimated cost of this project falls within the range of $1.0 million to $5.0 million, with an anticipated project duration of approximately fourteen (14) months. The construction portion of the project is estimated to begin April  2006. 


A qualified contractor will be selected using a Two-step, No-go “Low Price Technically Acceptable” (LPTA) source selection procedure, in accordance with Part 15 of the FAR.  Moreover, this will be a lump sum, fixed-price contract not set aside for small businesses. During step one of the Two-step LPTA, offers will be evaluated against the Go/No-go qualification factors.  Proposals found to be acceptable will then move on to step two of the evaluation process, during which price proposals will be opened and evaluated.  It is the Government’s intention to award the project to the lowest-priced bidder.  The bidder must also meet the Government’s standards of responsiveness and responsibility.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct negotiations if it is in its best interest to do so.

All elements of work to be executed must be within the congressionally mandated cost limitations. The contractor will be required to correct all deficiencies identified by the Government (or in its own quality control review) relating to the completeness or accuracy of the work, compliance with the contract, and compliance with any applicable laws or regulations.  The services procured under this contract will conform to the quality requirements in the specification.  Any Government furnished information relating to this acquisition will be distributed to parties after an award.  After an award, quality control will also include inspection, acceptance, warranty and other measures associated with quality requirements.  The contractor is not required to provide data or service for any of the systems that will be installed during this project.  Only typical inspection, training, acceptance, warranty and other requirements normally associated with our standard construction contracts will apply.  

Small Business Participation: This is a procurement open to both large and small business concerns. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 236220 with a small business size standard of $28.5 million. Although this procurement is not set aside for small businesses, small firms including women-owned, minority-owned, HUBZone, veteran-owned, and service disabled veteran-owned business are strongly encouraged to participate in this project. In accordance with 15 USC 631, large businesses will be required to provide these small firms the maximum practical opportunities to participate as subcontractors in the performance of this contract. Each large firm will be required to submit an acceptable subcontracting plan that meets, and preferably exceeds, the minimum acceptable subcontracting target goals established by the Small Business Administration (SBA). An acceptable subcontracting plan must be reviewed and approved by the SBA prior to award of this contract. Small businesses are not subject to this requirement. However, all firms seeking consideration for this contract will need to demonstrate a proactive effort to achieve the highest possible subcontracting goals for local business participation. Contractors will submit a written narrative (limited to one typed written page) along with their offers that outlines their outreach efforts made to utilize local firms. In order to receive the benefit of a price evaluation preference as a HUBZone small business concern, firms must be certified by the SBA. Please refer to the SBA website at www.sba.gov for details.

Joint Ventures: Joint ventures or firm/consultant arrangements will be considered and evaluated on a demonstrated interdependency of the members to provide a quality CMc team effort.

Proposal Submission Requirements: The solicitation package will only be available electronically. It will be available on or about January 13, 2006.

<DESC>Contractor to conduct an evaluation of the current version of the Transportation Financial Management System (TFMS) program release, determine the required changes to meet the stated objectives, and implement those changes.  This action includes completing interfaces, revising the data model, confirming capability to meet the system requirements and documenting all actions.  The effort will include completing the requisite reports for basic financial analysis for all three Transportation Component Commands (TCCs), as well as, USTRANSCOM and the Defense Courier Service (DCS). The completion of this effort will result in a Financial Data Warehouse and reporting capability that meets all stated objectives for the system.  The overall development objective is to build on the successes accomplished during the previous periods with the implementation of USTRANSCOM financial interfaces and related financial applications. The financial application provides both financial and operational data in a format that enables USTRANSCOM managers to make more informed financial decisions.  The application solution leverages existing systems, interfaces and infrastructure including the Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW).  This allows operational users a better understanding of transportation financial impacts relative to operations.

<DESC>Headquarters, US Army Field Support Command (AFSC) is conducting a market survey of industry to identify actual/potential sources that exhibit the capability to manufacture and supply RDX and HMX based explosives. As an indicator of your qualificatio ns, a respondent to this market survey must be able to demonstrate that they have adequate technical and manufacturing capacity, and acceptable past performance, in processing RDX and HMX explosive compositions and/or similar explosive material(s). A respo ndent to this market survey needs to have available the majority of the skills and facilities that are required to manufacture this item, in a facility located within the National Technology Industrial Base (NTIB). To meet the NTIB requirement the producti on of RDX and HMX based explosives must be accomplished within the boundaries of the United States or its territories, or in Canada. Subsequent to receipt of responses to this sources sought notification and analysis of all information submitted, it is con templated that a solicitation would be issued, restricting consideration of offers in accordance with 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(3)/FAR 6.302-3(a)(2)(i) to those submitted by NTIB sources. Interested companies who feel they have the necessary capabilities should res pond by providing the Government the following information by 18 May 2006: a summary of the companys capabilities; description of facilities, personnel and related manufacturing experience; estimated minimum and maximum monthly production quantities, with associated lead times for deliveries of RDX and HMX based explosive compositions; whether RDX and HMX explosives are in production or when they were last produced; other explosive materials produced.  If the respondent does not currently have adequate reso urces (technical, manufacturing, personnel, etc&) available, the respondent must be able to demonstrate the ability to obtain those resources in a timely manner. If a respondent chooses to utilize the services of sub-tier sources or subcontractors, those v endors and subcontractors must also meet these criteria.  A respondents available production capacity must be sufficient to manufacture/supply military grade RDX and HMX based explosives at a minimum quantity of 3.5M lbs/yr and a maximum quantity of 15M lb s per year to support a 5 yr. supply contract beginning FY08.

The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market research to include information received in response to this notice, or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  The Government will utilize the information provided for planning purposes only. Al l information submitted will be afforded appropriate protections as proprietary to the respondent.

Based on the responses received from this SOURCES SOUGHT announcement, the proposed acquisition may be solicited as set aside for any of the following: small businesses, 8(a) Small Disadvantaged Businesses, HUBZone small businesses, or Service-disabled veteran-owned small business.  THIS IS NOT AN REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE NIH, NCI TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE.  NO RFP PACKAGE IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  All eligible small business concerns responding to this Sources Sought Announcement must have the capabilities to provide the support necessary for information development in the areas of environmental and occupational cancer.  Respondents must document their ability to perform the three main task areas under this requirement, which are: Task 1 - Support of the Chemical Selection and Nomination Process; Task 2 - Support of Chemical Information Needs of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC); and Task 3 - Special Studies.

These three major task areas are comprised of the following subtasks: 

Task 1 - Support of the Chemical Selection and Nomination Process:

•	Perform two class studies of approved compounds per year, for a total of 10, during an estimated five-year period, including critical review of classes (structural or use) of chemical substances and preparation of a related report for review by the Chemical Selection Planning Group (CSPG) and the Chemical Selection Working Group (CSWG); 
•	Prepare summary sheets (in accordance with a specific format), which are compilations of all available literature on the compounds that will be reviewed at the CSWG;
•	Plan, support, attend and prepare minutes of 1-2 CSWG meetings and up to 4 CSPG meetings per year [Support for CSWG and CSPG meetings entails working closely with NCI program staff in the determination of meeting locations, development of agendas, gathering/collecting materials for these meetings and the compilation & distribution of data packages (containing the summary sheets and back-up material on the chemicals being considered at each meeting) to all attending CSWG members];
•	Prepare (for submission to the National Toxicology Program) data packages containing the summary sheets and CSWG recommendations for those chemicals selected/nominated for carcinogenicity bioassay or other toxicology studies; and
•	Maintain and update an NCI/DCB Chemical Tracking File [this is a computerized file which tracks the status of all chemicals being considered, or under consideration, for selection/nomination for carcinogenesis bioassay and other toxicology studies].

Task 2 - Support of Chemical Information Needs of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC):

•	Coordinate activities with IARC staff, the NCI Project Officer for the cooperative agreement with IARC, and the NCI Project Officer for this contract for an estimated five year period, in which approximately 15 IARC Working Group Meetings are anticipated, requiring submission of information for Section 1 - Exposure Data (Nomenclature, Chemical & Physical Properties, Technical Products & Impurities, Analysis, Production, Use, Occurrence [Natural, Occupational and Environmental], and Regulations & Guidelines); and
•	Be familiar with chemical industry economics (with an emphasis on patters of production), including chemical process flow, distribution, intermediate use & end products, on a world-wide basis (with special emphasis on the United States, Eastern & Western Europe and Japan), and have ready access to reliable national and international reference sources that can provide the required information.

Task 3 - Special Studies:

•	Respond to approximately 3 ad-hoc inquiries per month concerning chemical compounds.
•	Maintain information files [including files on meetings, correspondence dealing with this project, and a reference library (as a minimum, copies of articles and data acquired in the performance of this contract)].

Sources need to possess experience and demonstrated capability to accomplish the aforementioned requirements and are to supply pertinent information in sufficient detail to demonstrate their ability to perform the required services.  Information furnished must not exceed 20-25 pages and should include an outline of previous or similar projects and other available literature for the NIH to perform a proper evaluation of your capability statement.  Statements should also include an indication of current certified small business status; this indication should be clearly marked on the first page of your capability statement (preferably placed under the eligible small business concern’s name and address).

SOW Follows:
  
FARM SERVICE AGENCY
STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)

REQUEST FOR ONLINE MARKETING SERVICES
FOR CCC-OWNED GRAINS

Section 1.0	General Information

1.1	Background:
The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) proposes to contract for online marketing services of CCC-owned grain.  CCC’s definition of grain for purposes of this solicitation includes wheat, corn, grain sorghum, barley, oats, rice, and soybeans.  The online marketing service would supplement the current CCC sales methods of cataloging, issuing public invitations, and providing sales lists for grain.  The statutory authority of Section 5 of the CCC Charter Act provides that, “In the Corporation’s purchasing and selling operations with respect to agricultural commodities, the Corporation shall, to the maximum extent practicable consistent with the fulfillment of the Corporations purposes and the effective and efficient conducts of its business, utilize the usual and customary channels, facilities, and arrangements of trade and commerce, including, at the option of the Corporation, the use of private sector entities.”  Furthermore, P.L. 104-127, Section 165 states, in part, “… The Commodity Credit Corporation may sell any commodity owned or controlled by the Corporation at any price that the Secretary determines will maximize returns to the Corporation.”

CCC currently sells cotton and peanuts obtained through marketing assistance loan program forfeitures.  CCC sold 108,247 bales of cotton valued at $36.03 million in fiscal year 2004, and 17,616 bales valued at $4.07 million in fiscal year 2005.  In March 2006, CCC completed sales of 105,811 tons of 2004-crop peanuts valued at $31.73 million.

1.2	Objectives:

CCC’s objectives are to obtain competitive prices for grain inventories in the most cost-effective and least disruptive market manner.
 
Section 2.0	Statement of Work

2.1	Requirements:
CCC proposes to use online marketing services for sales of its own grain inventories.  The service provider must demonstrate to CCC’s satisfaction their previous experience with online marketing of 1 or more agricultural commodities, and meet the qualifications in Section 4.0.  Online marketing services will offer customers the opportunity to negotiate commodity prices, complete sales transactions and, as applicable, complete transfer of title in an electronic format.

The online marketing service contract will cover CCC-owned grain and be in place for a 12-month period.  CCC will have options to extend the contract for an additional four (4) 12 month periods. The Government is not obligated to exercise any Option Period. If CCC exercises this option, CCC will have a second, third, and fourth extension option for an additional 12 months, to provide for a total contract period of 60 months.  
The online marketing service must provide:  Online access to CCC personnel normally engaged in the merchandizing of grain; Help desk assistance to the users; Inventory sales data in an electronic format; and summary data on actual sales activities.

The online marketing services must include CCC-owned grain along with other industry owners/marketers of these commodities.  Generally, bids on government-owned commodities are somewhat lower than bids on privately owned commodities.  Making CCC-owned grain available on a private industry online marketing services website would eliminate the identification of the commodity as government-owned, which may result in higher bids.  The use of online marketing services will leverage market driven “best in class” technology, and use market forces in a fair and equitable manner to maximize returns to CCC.

2.2	Quality Assurances:
CCC will use the following guidelines to measure vendor performance:

1.	Grain inventory placed on the service will be made available for sale within 4 hours of receipt by the vendor.

2.	The vendor will have the marketing service available at least 8 hours a day during normal business hours (8:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. central time).

3.	All daily sales transactions will be finalized, including payment to CCC, no later than 9:00 a.m. on the next business day.

4.	Sales and inventory data will be provided to CCC on a daily basis, as soon as possible after close of business each day (and not later than 9:00 a.m. on the next business day).

5.	The vendor will ensure that the integrity of the system is maintained at all times.  Market positions, sales information, and inventory positions shall be restricted to authorized representatives of the vendor and CCC.

Section 3.0	Requirements/Tasks
The contractor shall provide the following services:

3.1	The contractor shall establish a marketing service for grain, available through the internet as an online and electronic function.

3.2	The contractor shall conduct online sales in a dynamic bidding system.  CCC shall maintain title to the commodity until confirmation of cash is received via wire transfer or electronic funds transfer (EFT), unless the vendor guarantees the sale.  If sale is guaranteed, CCC shall not be subject to losses incurred due to the failure of any subsequent transaction.  CCC may place grain on the online marketing service, or remove grain from the online marketing service, at CCC’s sole discretion, at anytime throughout the contract term.

3.3	The contractor shall protect both the buyer’s and seller’s identity.  Until a sale is confirmed, the price determining process shall be anonymous.

3.4	The contractor shall provide necessary security safeguards to ensure that market sensitive or proprietary data is secure from disclosure.

3.5	The contractor shall ensure that its users of online marketing services are entities actively engaged in merchandising commodities.

3.6	The contractor shall generate necessary inventory sales data to interface with CCC’s inventory systems.  See Section 10.0.

Section 4.0	Deliverables
4.1	Remote access to online marketing service for Bulk Commodities Division, Kansas City Commodity Office, and Warehouse and Inventory Division, Washington, DC.

4.2	Electronic interface requirements to make grain inventories available on online marketing service provided to Kansas City Commodity Office.

4.3	Ability to provide valid offers and to complete transactions of sales of commodities for Bulk Commodities Division, Kansas City Commodity Office.

4.4	Daily reconciliation of inventory and merchandising activities.
 

4.5	Deliverable Schedule:

All deliverables shall be functioning within 45 days of contract award.

	Director					Deputy Director

Section 6.0	Contractor Furnished Items
The vendor shall work independently.  The vendor will supply computer hardware and software, other equipment, and office space needed to conduct the work.

Section 7.0	Basis of Award
The award will be made using “Best Value” Selection Process.  The Technical Team will evaluate all proposals to identify all contractors whose proposals may be the best value to the government, price and other factors considered, in accordance with the SOW and the evaluation criteria set forth below.  Evaluation will be made using 4 evaluation criteria – (1) Technical Ability, (2) Past Performance, (3) Live Demonstration, (4) Price.  Evaluation of factors:  The combined Non-Price Related factors/experience are more important than Price.  In the case where technical ratings and past performance ratings vary only slightly between offers, price will become a determining factor.  Of all service providers meeting the basic requirements of technical ability and past performance, the Technical Evaluation Team will invite the apparent best value service provider(s) to conduct a live test demonstration.  The best value determination will be made after the live test demonstrations.

EPAct Technical Assistance


Public and private vehicle fleets continue to be the subject of broad interest as a test bed for implementing and evaluating new vehicle and fuel technologies.  Federal legislation has established a variety of requirements for fleets with the goal of reducing the nation’s petroleum consumption through the Energy Policy Acts (EPAct) of 1992 and 2005.  The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) implements these requirements through its FreedomCAR and Vehicle Technologies Program.  These activities are described in more detail at: http://www.eere.doe.gov/vehiclesandfuels/epact/index.shtml

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) provides technical, regulatory and analytic support to these activities.  NREL’s role is to analyze and report on fleet progress on reducing petroleum usage, analyze and propose innovations to accelerate progress, and provide tools and resources to enable fleets to meet and exceed their requirements.  NREL also assesses the impact of proposed legislation and program strategies on vehicular petroleum consumption, drafts guidance for fleets on new requirements, and provides technical evaluations of proposed new alternative fuels.  In addition, NREL is tasked with integrating work across several related petroleum-displacement programs, to leverage resources and ensure analytic work is synchronized with technical work in related R&D programs.

NREL is seeking individuals or organizations that have the required expertise to provide technical, regulatory and analytic support and assistance to NREL’s EPAct activities.  These individuals or organizations will be tasked with specific projects or project elements to support NREL’s annual operating plan.   Possible tasks for this project may include: (i) regulatory analysis of existing or proposed AFV or petroleum reduction legislation; (ii) development of draft guidance for regulated fleets; (iii) analysis of fleet requests for exemption from requirements based on technical data related to fleet and market characteristics; (iv) analysis of petroleum reduction potential of proposed strategies; (v) analysis of program data; and, (vi) coordination of specialized training for fleet representatives to help increase compliance.  Consequently, a detailed accounting of skills related to these areas is requested from interested sources. 

Organizations or individuals responding to this Sources Sought request must have some or all of the following capabilities, attributes, and skills, and specify the activity(ies) to which their qualifications would best apply:

1.	The organization/individual will demonstrate a historical involvement in, and extensive knowledge of, the alternative fuels and/or vehicle industry.  The organization/individual will describe its practical applied field experience or expertise with alternative fuel in specific fleet operations, particularly in designing and implementing AFV projects and in facilitating solutions to operational problems of AFV applications.

2.	The organization/individual will show that it has significant background and experience in analyzing legislation and regulations impacting AFVs, alternative fuels, fleets and petroleum reduction approaches.

3.	The organization/individual will demonstrate its capabilities in analyzing data, including data related to AFVs and alternative fuel use, and petroleum reduction strategies.  This may include technical and/or economic data. 

4.	The organization/individual will describe its abilities and expertise in the area of operating and managing alternative fuel workshops or training sessions at a local or regional level where attendance exceeds 50 people, and/or with smaller groups of AFV stakeholders or individual fleets.

The planned production contract is estimated to include a  basic buy of up to 1.4 million propelling charges with four years of options. a.	Essentially, the LAP of both the M231 and M232A1 MACS propelling charge  increments which comprise loading and assembling each increment, then packing  the increments in metal cans for shipment, and subsequent shipment to the  required destinations.  These operations involve the handling of energetic  materials (Class 4.1C flammable solid - to Class 1.1).  The main components,  which comprise each propelling charge increment, include the following: 1.)    Combustible cartridge case assembly consisting of body, cap, and center core  tube.  2.) Main charge propellant.  3.) End igniter which consists of end  igniter propellant contained in end igniter bags.  4.) Core igniter which  consists of core igniter propellant contained in a core igniter bag.  5.) End  seals, which cover the holes on both ends of the increments where the end  igniters are placed. b.	Operations include the following: 1.)   Sewing operations in order to  close the loaded igniter bags.  2.) Weighing operations in order to load the  correct mass of igniter propellants and main charge propellants.  3.) Vibration  operations in order to load the correct mass of igniter propellants and main  charge propellants.  4.) Gluing operations in order to bond the combustible  case cap to the body.  5.) Labelling operations in order to provide  identification for the increments, both on the increments, the metal shipping  cans and shipping pallets.  6.) The contractor shall be required to purchase  all packaging (excluding metal cans) materials necessary to Lap the propelling  charge increments which include sleeves, cushions, etc.  7.) The contractor  shall provide the end igniters and core igniters necessary to LAP the  propelling charge increments. 	Potential approximate combined LAP deliveries of the M231 and M232  propelling charge increments are outlined below: FY07 - LAP 1.4 million M231/M232 propelling charges. FY08 - LAP 1.6 million M231/M232 propelling charges. FY09 - LAP 1.6 million M231/M232 propelling charges. FY10 - LAP 1.6 million M231/M232 propelling charges. FY11 - LAP 1.6 million M231/M232 propelling charges. 	The contractor should have the following: a.   Experience in efforts of  similar complexity, such as the L.A.P. of other munitions for applications  120MM and larger, which incorporate rigid combustible cases, propellants and  igniters.  b.   Experience with respect to propellant handling/storage and  other hazardous handling/storage.            c.   Available on-site or near-site storage capacity to handle/store at least  1,000,000 pounds of energetic materials at one time. 	Firms with experience in the areas cited above should provide a summary  of their companyâ€™s capabilities including a description of facilities,  personnel and past experience to meet this requirement, see numbered note 25.   	This market survey should be restricted to U.S. and/or Canadian sources  due to the following reasons: a.	The MACS and its components are on The Militarily Critical Technologies  List (MCTL), Oct. 1992, as a critical element in section 12.2 for â€œGun  Propulsionâ€ system.  Therefore, the MACS Technical Data Package (TDP) is  restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S.C. Sec 2751, et. seq.)  and is subject to DoD Directives 5230.24 and 5230.25. b.	In accordance with DoD Directive 5230.24 and 5230.25, as a critical  technology, MACS is subject to export control, and additionally the drawings  are marked with limited distribution statement â€œFâ€ which states â€œFurther  dissemination only as directed by AMSTA-AR-AEE-B, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806- 5000 or higher DoD authorityâ€.   c.	MACS is a direct replacement for the 155MM Propellant Charge M203A1 and  all current bag-type 155MM Propellant Charges (M119A2, M4A2, M3A1).  It is on  the Industrial Preparedness Planning List (Ref: HQ, IOC Memorandum, signed by  Mr. Janik, Deputy Chief of Staff for Industrial Readiness, dated 14 May 1996).   The MACS components should be restricted to U.S. And/or Canadian production  sources. e.	As such the MACS TDP will not be released to any foreign company unless  this company can obtain an export license and also agrees to submit a  confidentiality statement which states that the information in the TDP will not  be used to produce any MACS components for any companies and countries without  the permission from the U.S. Government.

<SOLNBR>W91278-06-R-0065
<RESPDATE>062206
<ARCHDATE>08212006
<CONTACT>Judy F. McMichael, 251-441-6510
<DESC>MARKET SURVEY FOR PLANNING, EVALUATION, ANALYSIS, AND GUIDANCE FOR US ARMY HEALTH FACILITIES PLANNING AGENCY PROGRAMS   POC: For further information, contact Jacalyn Jenkins 251-441-5598. The NAICS CODE FOR THIS PROCUREMENT IS 541618. The Mobile Dist rict, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers intends to negotiate an Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity type Task Order Contract with Mitretek Systems, Inc., McLean, VA, as a nonprofit, conflict-of-interest free source, who does not compete for design or cons truction projects for private or government entities, and who has a high degree of expertise in the military medical and medical/biosafety laboratory fields to provide support for strategic planning, program policy analysis, and decision-making support for  the US Army Health Facilities Planning Agency.  The following types of services are required: detailed market analysis and healthcare planning; economic analysis for capital improvement decisions; special studies related to changing healthcare requirement s; program management support and facilitation, acquisition assistance; and advice to the government with regard to emerging technologies, shifts in practice trends, alternative future scenarios and funding strategies, etc.  Respondents must demonstrate a broad capability in the medical and biodefense laboratory fields, including experience in high-level policy making, guidance and regulatory compliance.  This procurement will be subject to stringent organizational conflict-of-interest provisions and respon dents must demonstrate an absence of such conflicts.  That is, the respondent is not engaged in other activities or relationships which would make the respondent unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the Government, or th e respondents objectivity in performing the contract work is or might be otherwise impaired, or the respondent has an unfair competitive advantage. The Health Facilities Planning Agency (HFPA) is responsible for the planning and execution of facility-related investments for hospitals, clinics, research and other medically-related facilities world-wide.  HFPA is seeking support with its initiatives to:  assess planning and capital requirements for Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) installations in selected markets and  multi- markets;  recapitalize the existing Army medical care delivery, medical research, and biodefense laboratory inventory; shape and im prove facilities in order to respond quickly and efficiently to the ever-changing face of Army and Military Health System (MHS) requirements; identify and use alternative business practices to leverage private industry capital in the development of Army fa cility projects; and, research emerging facility technologies and find opportunities to incorporate these technologies into the Army healthcare facility life cycle management process. The contractor shall assist HFPA in gathering the information needed to acquire, allocate, and manage resources for HFPA military functions.  The contractor may be required to assist HFPA in considering and addressing impacts to its program as a result of troops restationing, BRAC announcements, and coordination and interfacing with the Services in multi-service markets.  The contractor will assist HFPA in conducting special studies, investigations, or focused analyses on a variety of healthcare related iss ues and topics.  These analyses may involve a focused area of inquiry or may involve assessment of a broad set of topics.  Such investigations will feature preparation of a special output document(s) which include policy recommendations and/or actionable i tems/recommendations that should be pursued and that can be referenced by HFPA. In order to support HFPA in managing its program, the following characteristics will be required of the contractor: "	Independent and Objective.  To ensure credibility, consistency, and defensibility, the evaluation of contractor performance must be  free of any perceived or actual bias, free from conflict of interest, and based on the best possible analysis and expertise.  It is imperative that there be no potential for a conflict of interest on the part of the organization providing the required ess ential technical capability.  HFPA must be able to trust this organization with sensitive, government-proprietary information without concern for its misuse. "	Access to HFPA Planning, Budgeting, and Acquisition Information.  Some activities require extensive access to planning, budgeting, and acquisition information.  Given the frequent restructuring of corporate ownership, it is difficult to ensure that the r elease of sensitive information to a profit-seeking entity is not going to eventually undermine the integrity of current or future procurements.  Even if there is no actual harm, the appearance of a conflict of interest could severely handicap HFPAs abili ty to act.  Actual organizational conflict of interest is not eliminated completely by temporary exclusion clauses that attempt to separate conflict-free portions of a company from other parts that could gain a competitive advantage through access to sensi tive information, and none of these measures are effective against the appearance of a conflict of interest. "	Need for an Impartial Advisor.  There are many competing priorities within the HFPA operating entities and the requirement exists to engage an organization that can provide objective assessments and recommendations on both external and internal positions .  There is a continuing need to establish an objective resource to help HFPA sort out internal priorities and to represent a credible, independent input to the program management process.  This resource must have access to sensitive information and key de cision makers, and have the mandate to provide neutral ground where internal priority conflicts can be examined and fairly resolved. "	Continuity of Effort.  Informed program management decisions require enlightened advice based on broad, in-depth, and enduring knowledge of the HFPA corporate culture and way of doing business.  The use of a profit-seeking contractor to provide such cont inuity would be unwise in this situation because it would be difficult to maintain continuity without giving unfair competitive advantage and inhibiting appropriate free and open competition. To fulfill its responsibilities with the highest level of efficiency and cost effectiveness, HFPA requires the support of an organization that can simultaneously: "	Provide a general program management support, which it has successfully applied to other large and complex systems, "	Have access, beyond that which is common to the normal contractual relationship, to government and private sector data, including sensitive and proprietary data, and to employees and facilities, and "	Operate in the public interest with objectivity and independence and with freedom from any organizational conflict of interest. The support of an experienced, conflict free contractor is particularly important to HFPA when its policy choices and decision making have long range and far reaching implications. This support will be used to accomplish tasks that are integral to the mission and operation of HFPA, but it will not be used to perform inherently governmental functions or when the need can be met as effectively with in house resources or by other contra ct support gained via competition.  The contractor will be used when continuity of effort is critical, when the contractor possesses a unique and essential knowledge base, and/or when it is necessary to have access to sensitive or proprietary information, including strategic planning information.  The contractor will also be used when the nature of the work is such that it must be performed by an entity operating in the public interest, without profit motive, with objectivity and independence, and with free dom from organizational conflicts of interes t. The resultant contracts performance period will be a one-year base period with 4, one-year options. The maximum contract value for all years will be $10,000,000.00. This office believes that only one source, Mitretek Systems, Inc., can provide all of the above required support.  If any responsible source other than Mitretek Systems, Inc. can fulfill all of the above requirements, written notification and supporting documentation may be submitted in writing to: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Mobile, ATTN: CE SAM-CT-C(Jacalyn M. Jenkins), P.O. Box 2288, Mobile, AL 36628-0001 or jacalyn.m.jenkins@sam.usace.army.mil.  To be considered a viable source, documentation must clearly demonstrate: (1) freedom from actual or potential conflict-of-interest (2) extensive k nowledge in each of the areas described in the requirements above (3) past history detailing any contracts that your company is currently performing or has completed that would be considered the same as/similar to the type of services described above.  Inc lude the contract number, type of contract, dollar value, performance location, contract length, government point of contact and current phone number and (6) positive indication that your firm does not compete or bid for design, construction, or constructi on management project for private or government entities, and does not perform as a subcontractor for firms who do compete on these projects.  If no affirmative written documentation is received within 15 calendar days (03 May 2006) of this synopsis, the M obile District Corps of Engineers will proceed with negotiations to issue a contract to Mitretek Systems, Inc.  The Government will not pay for any material provided in response to this synopsis nor return the data provided.  The results of this synopsis w ill be considered to be in effect for a period of six months from the date of publication of this notice.  A solicitation is not available.

<DESC>As prescribed in FAR 15.209(c), the following provision is inserted: IAW FAR 52.215-3 --Request for Information (Oct 1997) (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the informatio n solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. (b) Although proposal and offeror are used in this Request for Information, your response will  be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.  (c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of identifying information on F-16 ARC-210 Antenna that have already been developed and may be modified to meet the agency requirement as listed below: AATC is conducting a Request for Information/ Sources Sought in an effort to determine potential sources for a Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) radio for Air National Guard (ANG) and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) F-16C Block (25, 30, 32) aircra ft. This announcement is for market research and does not constitute an RFP.  AATC is seeking contractors who are interested in providing two affordable antennas for a possible ARC-210 radio installation using the latest Commercial off-The Shelf (COTS) tec hnology. One antenna would be a replacement for one of the current UHF blade antennas on the F-16 to allow SINCGARS and the second antenna would be a conformal SATCOM antenna.  The initial effort would require one fully operational ARC-210 radio for an Ope rational Utility Evaluation (OUE). Follow on production phases are dependent on OUE results and funding, which is not currently budgeted.  The government is looking for a system that offers best value to the government, not necessarily the lowest procureme nt cost; however, affordability is the most important factor.  The following information is provided to assist in conducting a RFI/Sources Sought by identifying potential contractors who have the skills, experience, and knowledge required to successfully c omplete this effort.   Blade Antenna Requirements: (1) Form fit replacement for one of the current F-16 UHF blade antennas.  (2) Tunable antenna capable of 30 MHz to 512 MHz, tunable range must be 30-88 MHz, will receive tuning info through the ARC-210 antenna tuning interface.  (3) Antenna capable of SINCGARS.  (4) Antenna must not degrade current UHF or SADL communications ranges.  (5) Gains comparable to: -14 dBi at 30 MHz, -4 dBi at 88 MHz, -3.5 dBi at 108 MHz, -4.5 dBi at 174 MHz. SATCOM Antenna Requirements: (1) Conformal antenna capable of all F-16 operating conditions and limitations.  (2) 240 to 380 MHz.  (3) 125 watts minimum with 200 watts maximum.  (4) Right hand circular polarized.  (5) 2 dBiC minimum.  (6) The current UHF b lade antennas can be used for low angle SATCOM transmission and reception, the conformal antenna will be required to handle high angle SATCOM.   Interested parties capable of providing these antennas, which meets or exceeds the above requirements, shall provide a Statement of Capability (SOC) that demonstrates the existing capability to provide, modify, and sustain the system and a description of s ystem capabilities.  The SOC shall be unclassified and the information submitted should be pertinent to, and identify system capability as related to the technical effort requested above.  A limit of fifty (50) pages is imposed for the responses. Responses  should be received by close of business 1 September 2006. Please contact LTC Leonard Dick at (760) 295-6930 for programmatic questions or technical questions and Michael DeSouto at (520) 295-6938 for contracting questions oe e-mail at michael.desouto@aztucs.ang.af.mil.

<DESC>The Department of the Navy, SPAWARSYSCEN, San Diego requires engineering services in support of the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL) in concert with the Navyâ€™s Bureau of Medicine (BUMED) and Naval Health Research Center (NHRC).  Specific efforts include enhancement and research into the developed prototype casualty visibility system.  The ScenPro, Inc developed Tactical Medical Coordination System (TacMedCS) requires expanded functionality, increased reliability/durability, enhanced security/performance and scalability.  This additional engineering is needed to ensure integration into the Army's Battlefield Medical Information System-Tactical (BMIST).  The advanced research is required in order to support prototype participation in upcoming military exercises.  Since ScenPro, Inc has the unique familiarity with the initial system design and subsequent field modifications, the Government intends to award a sole source fixed price to ScenPro for this effort. The contract Period of Performance is estimated at 8 months. The estimated value of the effort is $565,008.  This is a single procurement with no anticipated follow-on potential.

1.  The following items will be delivered to the Government:

a.	Copy of annotated satellite imagery.
b.	Report containing satellite imagery annotation; discussion of annotation findings; presentation and discussion of thermal leakage data pertinent to the study; presentation and discussion of deep drilling data for the region of interest; subsurface interpretations consistent with the data in hand; and the identification of land areas with potential geothermal resources, if any are identifiable.  Alternative subsurface interpretations compatible with the geothermal and structural evidence in hand will be prepared.  If land with a potential for high temperature geothermal development is identifiable, evaluation of the risks if development is undertaken at such locations; and the presentation of suggestions as to follow-on studies that might be employed so as to reduce future development risks will be included.  Discussion will be included regarding the potential presence of industrial grade low temperature geothermal resources in addition to the high temperature resources being sought.  Any land suitable for further study and/or development will be identified.
c.	A briefing/seminar followed by a question and answer session will be held for one day at Mountain Home AFB.

SECTION III.	POINTS OF CONTACT

RELEVANCY DEFINITIONS

VERY RELEVANT	Past/present performance effort involved essentially the same magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.

RELEVANT	Past/present performance effort involved much of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.

SOMEWHAT RELEVANT	Past/present performance effort involved some of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.

NOT RELEVANT	Past/present performance effort did not involve any of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation required.


ADDENDUM TO FAR PROVISION 52.212-2, EVALUATION -- COMMERCIAL ITEMS (INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE ON STANDARD FORM 1449)

(a)  BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD:  The basis for award will be an integrated assessment based on tradeoff between past performance and price.  The Government will award the contract to the offeror who represents the best value to the Government in terms of past performance and price, as outlined below.  The government reserves the right to award the contract to other than the lowest priced offeror.  In a performance price tradeoff, the Contracting Officer will only clarify the offerors’ information; no discussions are contemplated in accordance with FAR 15.306.  Offerors may be given the opportunity to clarify relevance or adverse past performance to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond.  Clarifications are limited exchanges between the Government and offerors that may occur when award without discussions is contemplated.

      (1)  PAST PERFORMANCE:  Past performance confidence assessment shall be accomplished for all offerors, and each offeror shall be assigned one of the following ratings:

RATING	DEFINITION
	
High Confidence	Based on the offeror’s performance record, essentially no doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.
	
Significant Confidence	Based on the offeror’s performance record, little doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.
	
Satisfactory Confidence	Based on the offeror’s performance record, some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.
	
Unknown Confidence	No performance record identifiable (see FAR 15.305(a)(2) (iii) and (iv)).
	
Little Confidence	Based on the offeror’s performance record, substantial doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  Changes to the offeror’s existing processes may be necessary in order to achieve contract requirements.
	
No Confidence	Based on the offeror’s performance record, extreme doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.

a.  A number of past performance references provided by offerors will be selected and investigated.  Any derogatory past performance information obtained will be presented to the affected offeror and that offeror will have an opportunity to respond with any mitigating facts.  The final determination of past performance ratings shall rest with the contracting officer.

b.  An offeror with limited or no recent or relevant past performance will receive a rating of Neutral/Unknown Confidence, and will not be rated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.

c.  Past performance shall be evaluated on the basis of the following sub factors of equal importance:

1)  Quality of Work
2)  Timely Performance
3)  Management Effectiveness
4)  Cultural and Environmental Work Performance


      (2)  PRICE:

a.  Completeness:  The proposal covers all requirements of the performance work statement, includes all pricing information required by the solicitation, and the Price Schedule is completed as required.

b.  Reasonableness:  Prices are reasonable in comparison to estimates, prior prices paid, other offers received and can be supported by suitable estimating techniques.

c.  Realism:  The government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between the line items or subline items.  Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated, as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques.  For example, if unique and innovative approaches are the basis for an unbalanced/inconsistently priced proposal, the nature of these approaches and their impact on price must be completely documented.  The burden of proof of realism rests solely with the offeror.  A proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the government.

     (3)  PAST PERFORMANCE SHALL BE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE IMPORTANT THAN PRICE.

(b)  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>SMC/LGKM, located at Peterson AFB, CO, will award a contract as a commercial buy in order to modify the configuration of 2 AN/TSQ-180 (V)1/2 Milstar Ground Mobiles (GM) street-side and curbside Power Generation Unit (PGU) Radiator Installation Hose/Fitting Assemblies (Supply/Feed Lines) to eliminate anti-freeze leakage within their Power Generation Unit (PGU)/Environmental Control Unit (ECU) Compartments.  The two (2) Milstar Ground Mobiles (GM-2 & GM-3) PGU Radiator Installation Hose/Fitting assemblies (supply/feed lines) are leaking anti-freeze fluid (glycol).  A modification to the existing fittings to the proper length and dimensions to accommodate a proper seal is needed.  Removal of the coolant hose and modification of the elbow and bulkhead pipe as a one piece item is also required.  The intent of this modification is to eliminate a deficient plumbing design and glycol leaks at the coolant hose connection. The work will be accomplished on the Milstar GM-2 at the 153rd Command & Control Squadron (153 CACS) facilities on F.E. Warren AFB, WY, and on the Milstar GM-3 at the 4th Space Operations Squadron (4 SOPS) facilities on Schriever AFB, CO.

The Government contracted with Murphy Company to accomplish the PGU Radiator Installation Hose/Fitting Assembly Modification on the six (6) AN/TSQ-180(V)4 Milstar Communication Vehicles (MCVs) in October of 2003.

However, interested parties must submit an unclassified Statement of Capability (SOC) within 20 days  of this announcement demonstrating: intimate knowledge of the AN/TSQ-180(V)1/2 Milstar GM shelter (located at either FE Warren AFB, WY or Schriever AFB, CO) or AN/TSQ-180(V)4 MCV shelter (located at Greeley ANGB, CO), specifically the PGU/ECU Compartment; capability to perform modification at the two (2) vehicles operating locations—F.E. Warren AFB WY and Schriever AFB CO; ability to complete modification on both vehicles within 60 calendar days after contract award; a verification with the government Contracting Officer that only US citizens will accomplish all tasks associated with the assembly modification; an indication that all manufacturing of the work will be performed at the contractor’s location and inform the government where that local is; an assurance that welders performing the modification are ASME Section IX certified and have manufacturing capability within the greater Denver CO Metropolitan area; proof that the firm has the capability to complete work when a Department of Defense Facility Clearance Level of Secret applies to the effort.  The SOC shall not exceed 10 one-sided pages in length. Response must be submitted by e-mail in electronic form in MS Word 98 or higher or, PDF Format.  All responses must conform to 8.5 by 11 inch pages, with font no smaller than 12 point. The performance period is not expected to exceed 2 months, and will not involve any follow-on awards.  The projected Request for Proposal (RFP) release date for this effort is May 06 . This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only; it does not constitute an RFP.  Information herein is based on the best information available at the time of publication, is subject to revision, and is not binding on the Government. The Government will not recognize any cost associated with the submission of an SOC. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether any prospective credible source other then the incumbent exists.

Submit all responses to synopsis to: SMC/LGKM, Attn Victor Wells, 1050 E Stewart Ave, Peterson AFB, CO  80914-2902 (e-mail:victor.wells@cisf.af.mil).

HSAR 3052-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [DEC 2003]   [Full Text Follows]
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.  (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  “Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

FAR 52.212-1 – “INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS – COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 2006)”

FAR 52.212-2 – “EVALUATION – COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)” 

(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. 
Order of Importance:  The Government will evaluate proposals based on the following factors: Technical, Past Performance, and Price.  Technical (Factor 1), Past Performance (Factor 2), and Price (Factor 3) are of equal importance.
	
Evaluation Procedures:  The Government intends to award one contract to the responsive, responsible offer using the lowest priced, technically acceptable source selection process.  Technical Proposals shall be evaluated for acceptability or unacceptability only.  Award will be based on the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors.   Once a proposal has been determined acceptable under Factor 1 and Factor 2, the proposal will then be evaluated for the lowest price.

Factor 1 – Technical Capability:  Technical capability will be evaluated on an acceptable/unacceptable basis.  An offeror must comply with all aspects of the technical requirements as established in the Statement of Work and must meet criteria set forth in the Evaluation Criteria.  Also included are general considerations such as contract terms and conditions.

Factor 2 – Past Performance:  Past Performance acceptability will be evaluated on an acceptable/unacceptable basis.  Offerors without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance and, as a result, will receive a “Neutral/Unknown Confidence” rating for past performance. In investigating relevant past performance, the Government will consider information in the offerors proposal and information obtained from other sources.  Other sources may include past and present customers and their employees, other Government agencies including state and local agencies, pre-award surveys, consumer protection agencies and better business bureaus, and others who may have useful information.  Factors such as customer satisfaction, timeliness, product quality, and similarity to the existing project will be taken into account.  To be acceptable, the proposal must provide sufficient information about the offerors performance record that the Government can determine that the offeror should be able to successfully perform the required effort.

Factor 3 - Price:  Technically acceptable proposals found to have an acceptable record of technical capabilities and past performance will be evaluated for the lowest price.  Award will be based on the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors.

 (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
(End of Provision)
Discussions: Discussions or negotiations may be conducted with all offerors within the competitive range in accordance with FAR 15.610.  If an offeror is given an opportunity to correct any deficiencies in a proposal and after correction the proposal is still determined to be unacceptable, such determinations will be cause for rejection of the proposal.  No offeror will be given an unlimited amount of opportunities for correction of a proposal. The Government reserves the right to make a final determination whether a proposal is acceptable or unacceptable solely on the basis of the information submitted and to proceed without requesting additional information.

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment is to respond back to questions asked: 

Questions and Answers for BATF04LEASE:

1 - Our vehicle vendors have indicated that some of the 2007 models have not yet been released. In that case, would 2006 models be acceptable? 

2007 on the Yukon or Tahoe, the rest 2006 is ok

2 - Is there color preferences on the vehicles?

Dark would be best
 
3 - In addition to quoting new vehicles, would it be acceptable to quote 2006/2007 low mileage vehicles as an alternative to new?

New is what we want



4. On the cargo vans you request a rear A/C. Since these units will be out of stock deliveries in all probablility there will be no vehicles available with this option. Will ATF accept dealer installed units?

We would want the SLT packages on the trucks and suburban. (Power windows, locks, AC etc…)


5. Most of the requested items GM models. Will you accept Doge or Ford if the prices is less than the GMS?

We want either GMC or Chevy.

<DESC>In response to your questions regarding the RFQ for MRO services only, consider these the clarifications to the issues raised:

1. Attachment 1, C.3.C.  – The MRO shall provide a specimen statistical adjudication 	summary report by the fifth of each month…and the costs incurred:

	Question: This appears to be a re-cap of all testing during the prior period.  Is this separate from the invoice?  If not the invoice, what would constitute costs incurred?

	Answer: The specimen adjudication statistical summary may be the same as the invoice without invoice financials being included as long as the BEP receives the specific information stated in the SOW.


2. Attachment 1, C.4. (7) – Electronic Transmission- 

	Question: Does this refer to fax, web or e-mail?  How does the Bureau currently receive reporting of results?

	Answer: FAX. BEP has secure fax capability at both locations and will continue to receive results via fax.


3. Amendment 2- 14.2- Meetings-

	Question:  Meetings are requested each week for the first two months of the contract, and monthly thereafter.  Is the MRO Doctor always present, or can the lead MRO assistant be present when the MRO Doctor’s presence is not required?  Can these meetings be telephonic?  If so, how many times in the past is the MRO Doctor present at the meetings?  

	Answer: The MRO need not be present for every meeting. The MRO’s assistant or key staff is acceptable. Teleconferences will be the normal meeting format. Historically, face-to-face meetings in conjunction with site inspection with the MRO have been held annually at the MRO’s site.

4. Can you give us the quantity of positive tests reported in 2005 or the percentage?

	Answer: Less than 0ne (1) percent.

5. How does the MRO currently receive the MRO copy of the chain of custody?  Is it faxed or mailed or both?

	Answer: Collectors for both facilities immediately fax the MRO a copy of the CCF, and then mail copies to the MRO.


6. What other credentials must be sent besides certification and license?

	Answer: Section C.3D.(5) requires that malpractice insurance, MRO-related coursework, and curriculum vitae be made available to the BEP at all times.

7. Travel expenses?

	Answer: Do not include in your bid. If incurred for expert witness testimony, travel expenses will be reimbursed per federal government rates.

8. Witness testimony?

	Answer Specify hourly rates for expert witness testimony on an as-needed basis.
