<CONTACT>Karen J Hillstead, Contract Specialist, Phone 931-454-7843, Fax 931-454-7330, Email karen.hillstead@arnold.af.mil
<DESC><p>This requirement is for design, analysis, fabrication, performance testing, and acceptance testing of the Infrared Source Translator (IST) and Collimator Optics Translator (COT). The IST and COT are major components of the Short Focal Length Collimator (SFLC) system, a new target simulation and background radiation projection system for the AEDC 7V Chamber. The SFLC will complement the existing 7V Chamber long focal length collimator. The SFLC design features a custom designed focal length to accommodate currently available thermal emitter arrays and to project simulated target images through a 1 degree by 1 degree field of view. The IST will be used to precisely position either an IR flood source or a thermal emitter array with respect to the SFLC collimator optics package. The COT will be used to position the SFLC collimator optics package either in its operate position or its stowed position inside the 7V Chamber. When the SFLC system is not required, it is necessary to stow the SFLC collimator to clear the IR beam paths of the existing 7V collimator. The IST and COT designs must address analysis of low temperature thermal and thermo/structural effects; selection and preparation of materials for cryogenic application and repeated thermal cycling; and control of contamination and optical surface reflection and scatter. The performance of each translator shall be demonstrated under high-vacuum, cryogenic operational conditions prior to final acceptance at AEDC. Delivery of the SFLC system is expected within 6 months following contract award. Delivery shall be FOB Destination to AEDC, Arnold AFB TN. This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. Only businesses that have been certified by the Department of Defense, United States/Canada Joint Certification Office, and have a legitimate business purpose may have a copy of the solicitation document. All requests for copies of the solicitation document must include a certified copy of DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement. The solicitation package will be mailed to the data custodian identified in Block 3 of the DD Form 2345. To obtain certification, contact: Commander, Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS), ATTN: U.S./Canada Joint Certification Office, 74 Washington Avenue North, Battle Creek, MI 49017-3084 or call the DLIS at (800) 352-3572.

<DESC>POC For this procurement is Harry Lutz, Contract Specialist; Harry.Lutz@FAA.gov; (609) 485-6127********************************************************************************
The test and evaluation (T&E) process is the key to ensuring a system is reliable, maintainable, and safe. It is the FAA's mission to maintain a safe and efficient airspace system; hence the FAA is continuously exploring ways to improve their T&E abilities. The William J. Hughes Technical Center (Technical Center) in Atlantic City, New Jersey is the lead test and evaluation facility of the FAA. The Technical Center has always valued partnerships which help improve the challenges of T&E. The Technical Center has embarked on collaborations with other international organizations through Action Plan 16 with EUROCONTROL , inter-governmental agencies through the Joint Development and Planning Office and Next Generation Air Traffic System (NextGen), industry through a Collaborative Research Development Agreement (CRDA) with the Boeing Company developing the Aircraft Intent Description Language, and academia through the FAA/NASA Joint University Program. These collaborations have been proven to be vital in enhancing the T&E process.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has developed a new Air Traffic Control (ATC) system to replace the existing Host Computer System in the en route domain. This system is called ERAM, for En Route Automation Modernization, and is being developed by the Lockheed Martin Corporation (LM). One primary component of ERAM is the Decision Support Tool (DST), which assists air traffic controllers in separating air traffic. Two key functions of ERAM's DST are the prediction of the future flight paths of the aircraft and the prediction of future conflicts between two aircraft or between an aircraft and a Special Use Airspace. The Factory Acceptance Test (FAT) was successfully performed by LM in September 2007. After the FAT Run for Record (RFR), a study was conducted in support of the testing and evaluation of these two key functions. This study was conducted by the Conflict Probe Assessment Team (CPAT) in the Simulation and Analysis Team (AJP-661) at the William J. Hughes Technical Center (Technical Center) .  
In order to properly test ERAM, a large amount of data must be analyzed; thus, the system outputs an ample amount of air traffic data. Visualization tools create visual overviews of the large amounts of abstract data that usually are stored in various database tables or files. With the involved task of analyzing the data, a need for visualization tools in which to easily interface the data was realized. Development of visualization tools is not a skill set that CPAT possessed; therefore, CPAT is requesting academic partners to collaborate in the development visualization tools to aid the analysts evaluating the operational tools like ERAM and future automation concepts.  
The FAA is looking to partner with academic institutions within a 40 mile distance of the FAA W. J. Hughes Technical Center in Atlantic City, New Jersey.  The institution must have the following qualities:1.	A rich base of undergraduate and graduate students in Computer Science, Software Engineering and Engineering disciplines.  2.	A faculty with experience and willingness to develop visualization tools in Java to remotely access FAA air traffic data in a relational database (e.g. Oracle).3.	Selected students must be able to be employed during the summer and part time during the academic calendar to support the research and be managed by the faculty.4.	The participating faculty and selected students must be able to pass FAA government security clearances to enter and work within the facility and laboratories.5.	The participating faculty must have some experience in developing visualization tools in Java and working with relational databases to direct the students accordingly.
The greater the experience level of the managing faculty, the better chance of selecting the university as the partner.  Experience in working with aviation related data is also a desired quality.

  See details of Action Plan 16 at "http://acy.tc.faa.gov/cpat/tjm/".  See details of this analysis in FAA Technical Note at "http://acy.tc.faa.gov/cpat/docs/EramMetricsTechNoteTN08_10.pdf".

The Government conducted a Market Research in accordance with the Federal Acquisition 
Regulations (FAR) Part 10, Market Research, has determined that Dr. Fayaz Shawl, M.D. firm is 
currently the only company that can provide the Consultant services specified herein.  
The Cardiovascular Intervention Program within the Translational Branch is developing image-guided transcatheter cardiovascular interventional procedures.  This requires development of preclinical animals and early clinical testing.  It includes conventional and investigational clinical cardiovascular care.  These require subspecialty expertise of physicians who are board specialized in internal medicine, cardiovascular disease, and interventional cardiology, namely Dr. Venkatesh Raman, M.D. who previously worked with the VA and now will be working for the Private Practice of Dr. Fayaz Shawl.  The program currently has only one full-time physician with these credentials and requires additional expertise well versed with the complex and specialized research environment of the Translational Medicine Branch.

Having the expertise of physicians who are board specialized in internal medicine, cardiovascular disease, and interventional cardiology, requires the assistance of Dr. Raman to participate in management of patients with cardiovascular disease being considered for transcatheter treatment, including outpatients, inpatients, those with coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, structural heart disease, and congenital heart disease.  Dr. Raman has been successfully conducting this type of work with the Cardiovascular Intervention Program since 2001, first as a clinical research fellow, then via the George Washington University Medical Faculty Associates and, thereafter, through an Inter-Agency Agreement (with 40% effort) with the Department of Veterans Affairs where had a full-time appointment.  Dr. Raman is an established world expert in the field with a demonstrated publication record.  Dr. Raman has been an integral part of the Cardiovascular Intervention Program in developing the institutional experience with real-time interventional MRI, MR-fusion-guided intervention, non-invasive magnetic resonance angiography with novel contrast agents, and cardiovascular biologics.  His particular participation is considered essential to the mission of the Program. Dr. Raman’s ongoing participation provides continuity of experience, institutional memory, and eliminates additional time and resources required for recruitment, training and retention of other individuals with this specialized skill set.

<SUBJECT>Disability Case Processing System (DCPS)
<SOLNBR>SSA-RFP-10-1013
<CONTACT>Traci S Leach, Contract Specialist, Phone  , Fax  , Email traci.leach@ssa.gov - Ida M. Ryan, Contract Specialist, Phone  , Email ida.ryan@ssa.gov
<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 5.203, the Social Security Administration is publishing this pre-solicitation synopsis notifying interested parties of its intent to release an RFP for the development of a new common Disability Case Processing System (DCPS). <br /><br />SSA is responsible for administering a variety of national social insurance programs, social welfare programs, and for providing operational systems for those programs within SSA as well as to other Federal and State agencies. The new common DCPS will support SSA's disability workload which consumes over half of SSA's operational work years and is the most complex component of its programs. Disability applications are filed by the public via the internet, by phone, or in person at one of the agency's local field offices. The field office determines basic technical eligibility requirements. Thereafter, if the basic eligibly requirements are met, the field office routes the claim to a disability determination case processing site (DDS's), which could be a state or federal component. The DDS's is responsible for the medical determination for the disability. In the event of a denial of the disability, the public has the right to file for reconsiderations and appeals of unfavorable decisions. The reconsiderations are processed at the state DDS's and appeals are processed federally by a SSA hearing office. <br /><br />There are 54 state and federal disability determination case processing sites located throughout the United States and its territories. The system environments consist of locally administered and maintained legacy software and associated hardware. These systems are primarily derivatives of five core systems, which have been built over time by various organizations, and have been significantly customized to meet local management needs. <br /><br />The purpose of the solicitation will be to replace the five disability determination case processing systems into a single system. The proposed new Disability Case Processing System will be implemented using Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) principles and methods, and will incorporate services, which will be available for use Enterprise wide. The new system needs to be flexible so that changes to policy, procedures, or law can be accommodated quickly and effortlessly. The new system is also expected to integrate seamlessly with existing software applications in use by the State DDS's and other agency components as well as access historical data where and when necessary. Further, it must also comply with the SSA'S enterprise architecture and database standards and strategy. <br /><br />SSA anticipates an award of an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Labor Hour type contract. The period of performance shall be for one base year and five-one year options. Work under this proposed contract will be performed through the issuance of firm fixed price or labor hour type task orders, with fixed hourly rates based on the labor categories in the contract. The upcoming solicitation will also include&nbsp;two (2) proposed Task Orders which offerors must respond to and may be issued at time of award. <br /><br />A pre-proposal conference is planned approximately ten (10) days after issuance of the RFP to go over the administrative and pricing requirements, and an overview of SSA's architecture and technical requirements. A separate notice will be published in fedbizops to schedule the exact date, time and place.<br /><br />Request for Proposal (RFP) Number SSA-RFP-10-1013 will be released on or about 15 days after publication of this notice, on the Federal Procurement website at www.fbo.gov. Vendors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and any amendments. Potential vendors are responsible for downloading copies of the solicitation and amendments (if any). Please note, THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP). If additional information is required before the release of the RFP, please contact Traci Leach at traci.leach@ssa.gov. No phone calls will be accepted. The government does not intend to pay for any information submitted. <br />

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p>PROCUREMENT STRATEGY</p>
<p>The General Services Administration intends to award a firm-fixed price Contract using a Two-Phased Best Value approach. The "Best Value Concept" is a method of evaluating price and other factors specified in the RFP to support selection of the proposal that offers the best value to the Government in terms of performance and other factors. The objective is to select the proposal that represents the most for the money, not necessarily the lowest price, and reflects the offeror whose performance is expected to best meet the stated requirements. This approach also provides the opportunity to select cost/technical trade-offs and does not require the award to be made to the offeror submitting the lowest cost proposal.</p>
<p>For this contract award process, GSA will issue two Solicitations in sequence: 1) Phase One, and 2) Phase Two. The Phase One procedure (which is analogous to a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) is designed to select a "short list" of the most highly qualified Offerors who will be requested to submit Phase Two proposals. All responsible sources may submit a Phase One Proposal. The contracting officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. The most highly rated Offerors will be selected to participate in Phase Two (analogous to Request for Proposals (RFP)).</p>
<p>In Phase One, the Government shall identify the evaluation factors other than cost or price that will serve as the basis for the determination of the most highly qualified Offerors. Interested Offerors will be required to submit their responses to the RFQ by the due date established in the RFQ. The Government will evaluate all the responses to the RFQ in accordance with the criteria in the RFQ, and advise each Offeror in writing whether it will be invited to participate in the Phase Two process. Offerors that do not submit a timely RFQ response in Phase One will not be allowed to participate in the remaining phase of the procurement.</p>
<p>In Phase Two, the Government will issue the RFP to the most highly qualified Offerors from Phase One and request that they submit Phase Two technical proposals. For this RFP, technical evaluation factors, when combined, will be significantly more important than cost or price. The importance of price will increase if Offerors' non-pricing proposal factors are considered essentially equal in terms of quality or if price is so high or low as to significantly diminish the value of a proposal's technical superiority to the government. The award may be made without negotiation of proposals. Therefore, offerors will be requested to initially submit proposals to the Government on the most favorable terms from a technical and price standpoint.</p>
<p>Phase Two of the solicitation shall be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 15 and include phase-two evaluation factors, developed in accordance with FAR 36.303. Phase Two of the solicitation shall require contractor interviews/presentations at the Denver Federal Center, which shall be evaluated separately in accordance with FAR Part 15. For this RFP, technical evaluation factors, when combined, will be significantly more important than price. The importance of price will increase if Offerors' non-pricing proposal factors are considered essentially equal in terms of quality or if price is so high or low as to significantly diminish the value of a proposal's technical superiority to the government. The award may be made without negotiation of proposals. Therefore, offerors will be requested to initially submit proposals to the Government on the most favorable terms from a technical and price standpoint.</p>
<p>The RFQ will be issued electronically after September 23, 2009 on the internet at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.</p>
<p>Opportunities for other than Large Businesses: This procurement will be open to large and small business firms. Any qualified responsible firm, including small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business is encouraged to participate as a prime contractor or as a member of a joint venture with other small businesses, or as a subcontractor Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d), FAR subpart 19.702 and FAR subpart 19.12.

<DESC>The Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation (Corporation) plans to issue an Invitation For Bids (IFB) for furnishing all plant, labor, equipment and materials and for performing all work for replacing the 1950’s vintage electromechanical operating machinery and control with hydraulic machinery and PLC’s to operate the filling and emptying valves at Eisenhower and Snell Locks in Massena, New York.  The filling and emptying valves are reverse tainter valves and are approximately 15 feet x 15 feet and operate under a 43 foot differential head.  The project is to replace the electromechanical equipment with one (1) hydraulic power unit for each valve; however each hydraulic power unit is sized to operate a miter gate leaf and ship arrestor equipment in the future.  The work includes, but is not limited to demolition and placement of concrete; removal of existing components that are not being reused,and refurbishing of components that will become part of the new operating equipment; installation of the hydraulic power units, cylinders and piping; installation of wiring and making all required electrical connections; and installation of PLC’s, performing the programming to operate the new equipment and integrating these controls with the existing lock controls.  Plans are to award a contract for replacement of the operating machinery and control for four (4) valves (one (1) filling and one (1) emptying valve at the north side of Eisenhower Lock and one (1) filling and one (1) emptying valve at the north side of Snell Lock) prior to September 30, 2009 with the on site portion of the work to be completed while the Seaway is closed to navigation during winter 2011, approximately between January 1, 2011 and March 15, 2011.  It is critical that this timeframe be adhered to because failure of this equipment to operate on or before March 15, 2011, could cause the entire Seaway system to remain closed to navigation. The bid documents will include an optional requirement for award prior to September 30, 2011 for the operating machinery and controls for the remaining four (4) valves (the south side filling and emptying valves at Eisenhower and Snell Locks) with the work to be completed between January 1, 2012 and March 15, 2012 or January 1, 2013 and March 15, 2013, dependent upon when the optional requirement is awarded.  The project cost range is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. The applicable NAICS code is 237990 with a size standard of $33.5 M.  Drawings are available on CD for $20.00 US funds or hard copy for $300.00 US funds. The Invitation for Bid (IFB) package will be issued approximately August 3, 2009 with a bid opening date on or about September 15, 2009.  A firm fixed price contract shall be awarded.  Mail your request for the IFB package along with the above fee to Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation, Attn:  Contracting Office, PO Box 520, 180 Andrews Street, Massena, New York 13662.  All responsible sources may submit a bid which shall be considered by the Corporation.  This procurement is subject to the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program and is open to both small and large business.  Prospective offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) to be eligible for award.  Please register with the CCR at www.ccr.gov.  Attention:  The Department of Transportation (DOT) Short Term Lending Program (STLP) offers financial assistance to eligible disadvantaged, Hubzone, or service disabled veteran owned businesses.  Maximum line of credit is $750,000.00 with interest at the prime rate, as published in the Wall Street Journal, plus 2 points.

<a href="mailto:mark.junda@va.gov">Contract Specialist Email Address</a>
<DESC>SynopsisThe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Technology Acquisition Center (TAC), Eatontown, NJ 07724, intends to procure a HYPERchannel technology "refresh" of hardware, software, and technical support services. This refresh shall include the HYPERchannel infrastructure connecting the Bull and IBM mainframes at the Hines Information Technology Center (HITC) and the Philadelphia Information Technology Center (PITC). This effort is intended to be sole source to Network Executive Software Inc., 6420 Sycamore Lane N STE 300 Maple Grove, MN 55369-6013, although all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.  Submissions must be made within 14 days of this announcement.  The Government anticipates award on or before 16 November 2009. The solicitation will be issued as a request for quote (RFQ) from the VA TAC, and the number assigned to it will be VA-118-09-RQ-0060. The proposed action is for a 9 month, Firm-Fixed Price contract.  The place of performance shall be split between the contractor's facility, as well as the Department of Veterans Affairs, Information Technology Center campuses at Hines, Illinois and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  The current HYPERchannel hardware infrastructure is obsolete and not currently supported.  Parts are unavailable which does not allow for system maintenance.  In the event the system fails, veteran benefits will be inaccurate or delayed until execution of this action.  This refresh will upgrade the system to a supportable level so that a system failure can be brought back to successful operation as soon as possible.  Due to the current condition of the HYPERchannel hardware and Bull GCOS OS, the HYPERchannel refresh is a required "first step" in the critical path to migrate the hardware and operating systems to currently supported technology.  The refresh shall support both bulk file transfer between the Bull and IBM mainframes and print file transfer from the Bull mainframe to the IBM mainframe.  The print file transfer requirements include transferring job print output to the BMC output management software CONTROL-D, the HITC and PITC output distribution management solution, for subsequent printing and/or archiving.  The Government requires a solution that integrates with the bulk file transfer and print file transfer functions, and with the BMC Control software for subsequent printing, print file transfer, and archiving, as currently implemented on the HITC Bull and IBM systems.NetEx is the original developer and manufacturer of the HYPERchannel technology and infrastructure connecting the Bull and IBM mainframes including all the hardware and software used in the HYPERchannel.  NetEx possesses unique knowledge and an in-depth understanding of the HYPERchannel technology and infrastructure and is the only company capable of providing the HYPERchannel refresh services required by the VBA under this proposed action.  The Government does not possess a detailed technical data package, drawings, or data for the HYPERchannel infrastructure, hardware or software.  In order to meet the Government's requirements, modifications to the existing HYPERchannel software are required. This software is proprietary to NetEx.All proposal documents and communications shall be made available through the Contract Specialist, Mark Junda, via email at mark.junda@va.gov, or via telephone at 732.578.5428.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) for Army/Defense Knowledge Online Go Mobile Vendor Capability Day<BR><BR>SUMMARY<BR>This Request for Information (RFI) is being issued as part of an effort to understand market availability, industry best practices, technical characteristics, and functionality of information technology (IT), tools or products capable of enhancing and/or extending the Army/Defense Knowledge Online (AKO/DKO) mobile messaging solution.  Subsequent to the receipt of responses to this RFI the AKO/DKO Project Management Office (AKO/DKO PMO) may invite select RFI respondents to a private technical interchange session to discuss their response with Government representatives at a later date.   <BR>This is not a request for proposal, request for quotation, or an invitation for bid, nor does its issuance obligate or restrict the Government to an eventual acquisition.  All information received from this RFI will be used for Market Research purposes only.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise reimburse vendors for the preparation of any information submitted or Government use of such information.  Acknowledgement of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified regarding the outcome of the information received.<BR><BR>AKO/DKO BACKGROUND<BR>The AKO/DKO vision is to transform the AKO/DKO portal into a Department of Defense (DoD) portal that enhances collaboration efforts by enabling services to organize and share information and be strategically responsive and dominant at every point in the spectrum of defense operations.  <BR>AKO/DKO is being built on the current AKO/DKO enterprise portal platform.  AKO was started as a pilot project in 1997 and was so successful that the Secretary of the Army and Chief of Staff mandated that all data, information and systems be moved behind this portal. The AKO portal represented the first step in building the Army intranet. AKO is the principal tool used in transforming the Army to a knowledge based organization. The current AKO/DKO suite of services is built upon Appian Enterprise Business Process Management (BPM) technologies with many customized Enterprise Content Management (ECM) features.<BR>The AKO/DKO PMO has recently developed a capability designed to extend AKO/DKO services to the mobile AKO/DKO end user.  This solution includes application software, middleware, comprehensive security architecture, and a mobile device suite to enable secure user access to core AKO/DKO services and information, such as electronic mail and collaboration data.  The AKO/DKO PMO intends to field the Good Technology-developed solutionwhich the Army has re-branded as Go Mobilethrough a phased deployment to all AKO/DKO users in 2010.  Additionally, in an effort to foster adoption, enhance flexibility, and embrace Web 2.0 innovation, the AKO/DKO PMO is currently in discussions with other potential industry partners, such as Apple and Research In Motion, to develop secure mobile technology and messaging solution alternatives for the AKO/DKO customer base, which is rapidly approaching 2.5 million end users.  In this way, the AKO/DKO project remains system and application agnostic and will continue to consider adopting emerging technologies such as the Android mobile operating system for expanding AKO/DKO capabilities.<BR><BR>RFI OBJECTIVES<BR>This Request for Information is intended to improve the Governments understanding of the technologies, solutions, innovations, and products available in the marketplace for (1) enhancing the AKO/DKO experience leveraging emerging mobile technologies, (2) further extending AKO/DKO services to the mobile end user and (3) furthering the AKO/DKO knowledge management mission by optimizing use of the mobile spectrum.  Vendor responses should address the following items: <BR>1. Solution or capability and benefits  Describe the proposed software solution set, peripheral device technologies or product, and the benefits to the Army, the AKO/DKO PMO, the warfighter and the civilian (including friends and family) end user.  Discuss the technical and business value merits of the solution or capability, the degree of innovation and risk of the solution or capability, and the technical viability of the proposed solution set, technology or product.<BR>2. Assumptions, risks and limitations  Itemize the pre-requisites, constraints, implementation or adoption impediments and potential negative outcomes associated with the proposed solution set.<BR>3. Solution/product maturity  Explain where the proposed solution set is in its product-development lifecycle, including whether it is currently available for purchase, undergoing proof-of-concept or if the vendor is seeking a Research and Development partnership with the Army. <BR>4. Relevant technology forecast  Highlight applicable technology trends, identify opportunities for integration & convergence, and demonstrate how AKO/DKO can leverage the mobile spectrum and complementary technologies to extend its secure footprint across the Armys global network.<BR>5. Current viable contract vehicles  Provide contract references (including contract number, contracting activity and primary Agency) for active vehicles accessible by the Army.<BR><BR>GO MOBILE SOLUTION DESCRIPTION<BR>Go Mobile utilizes Good Technologys Good Mobile Messaging (GMM) product is a wireless, real-time messaging and enterprise application access system.  The solution is encrypted from end-to-end, FIPS 140-2 validated, DISA STIG checklist compliant, and has been issued an Authority to Operate by the Armys Program Executive Office for Enterprise Information Systems (PEO-EIS). GMM supports the DoD S/MIME Public Key Infrastructure, including Common Access Card (CAC) with industry standard Bluetooth CAC readers.  GMM is built on industry standards to permit choice of wireless networks, platforms and handhelds. <BR><BR>GMM is an integrated product suite that includes the following components:<BR>1. Good Mobile Messaging  (GMM)  Offers up-to-date wireless access to e-mail and personal information management (PIM) functions of the Sun Java Communication System (SJCS), including e-mail, contacts, calendar, and tasks/to do lists. The cradle-free system continuously synchronizes data between the wireless handheld and the GMM server behind the firewall.<BR>2. Good Mobile Messaging Server  GMM server software monitors the users AKO/DKO mailbox and synchronizes any mailbox activity with the Good Network Operations Center (NOC), which then passes the e-mail and data through the wireless network to the users handheld. Changes made on the handheld are sent to the Good NOC via the handhelds radio transmitter and the wireless network, and they return from the Good NOC via the Good Messaging Server to the AKO/DKO enterprise messaging server. Messages sent over the Good System are encrypted end-to-end using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) security technology.<BR>3. Good Management Console (GMC)  The Good Management Console (GMC) provides an integrated, centralized management console from which an administrator can set up, manage and view users, as well as monitor servers and handhelds. AKO/DKO can distribute management tasks across a hierarchy of administrators by using role-based administration, which offers a set of roles, with varying permissions, for administering the Good Messaging Server and users.  Handheld security policies are managed through the GMC, including:<BR>* Password policies<BR>* Handheld component controls (e.g., Bluetooth, IR ports, camera, SD card, etc.)<BR>* Remote data erase<BR>* Handheld application control (e.g., application blacklisting and mandatory application checking, etc.)<BR>4. Good Network Operations Center (NOC)  Provides reliable delivery via a multi-level Positive Acknowledgement Architecture that ensures that even when a handheld goes out of coverage, messages will be appropriately queued and then sent in order, once the handheld is back in coverage. All data flowing through the NOC are encrypted with a unique, symmetric key known only to the user.<BR><BR>Additional information describing the current Go Mobile solution (i.e., Good Mobile Messaging S/MIME) is publically available at www.good.com. <BR><BR>SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS<BR>Respondent submissions should be submitted in a slide presentation not to exceed ten (10) slides in Arial font no smaller than 12 pt.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR BID – PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS ARE NOT AVAILABLE.

THIS NOTICE IS BEING ISSUED TO DETERMINE IF THERE IS SUFFICIENT  INTEREST FROM QUALIFIED TOTAL HUBZONE, OR SERVICE DISABLED VETERAN-OWNED SMALL BUSINESSES TO SET THIS PROJECT ASIDE. (Details Below).  

Prime Contractors who are HUBZone small businesses, 8(a) small businesses, or Service disabled veteran-owned small businesses and who intend to submit a bid for this solicitation MUST submit the following by e-mail to CFLContracts@fhwa.dot.gov or by telefax to 720-963-3360 (Attn:  Craig Holsopple) for receipt by close of business (3 p.m. local Denver time) on October 9, 2009:  

(1) A positive statement of your intention to submit a bid for this solicitation as a Prime Contractor; 

(2) A copy of the letter from SBA stating date of HUBZone small business certification or acceptance to the 8(a) small business program.  In the case of a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Concern, you must provide proof of eligibility (DD form 214 or a letter of adjudication from the Veterans Administration).  This information must be provided in order to determine eligibility – DO NOT SEND COPIES OF YOUR CCR PROFILE; 

(3) letter from bonding agent stating your firm’s capability to bond for a single project of $10.0 million, and your firm’s aggregate bonding capacity; and

(4) Provide a list of road construction projects involving traffic control, sequencing and phasing, earthwork, HACP production and placement, OGFC production and placement, PCCP production and placement, concrete barrier, parking area electrical system installation, and interstate type interchange lighting, signing, and drainage appurtenance installation.  Also include road construction projects that required management of extensive multidisciplinary performance and interrelated construction operations.  State whether your firm was the prime contract or subcontractor on the project(s).  DO NOT SEND INFORMATION ON PROJECTS THAT DO NOT INCLUDE THE ABOVE WORK.
 
The size of a small business firm includes all parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, etc.  Refer to the Code of Federal Regulations 13 CFR 121.103 for information on how the SBA determines affiliation and 13 CFR 121.108 regarding the penalties for misrepresentation of size status.  All firms should be certified in the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) located at https://orca.bpn.gov/

A Qualified HUBZone SBC receiving a HUBZone contract for general construction must spend at least 50% of the cost of the contract incurred for personnel on its own employees or employees of other qualified HUBZone SBCs.  This requirement may be met by expending at least 50% of the cost of the contract incurred for personnel on its employees or it may subcontract at least 35% of the cost of the contract performance incurred for personnel to one or more qualified HUBZone SBCs.  A qualified HUBZone SBC prime contractor may not, however, subcontract more than 50% of the cost of the contract incurred for personnel to non-qualified HUBZone SBCs.

PROJECT DETAILS:  This project is located about 30 miles southeast of Las Vegas, Nevada, on US93 within the Hoover Dam Reservation Area and Lake Mead National Recreation Area.  The alignment crosses the Arizona/Nevada state line as a US93 Bypass of Hoover Dam.   

The project consists of Schedule A and Option X.  Schedule A includes final roadway improvements along the 4.4 miles of new mainline alignment along with interchange ramps and access roads near each end of the project. Option X, if exercised, includes utilities, sidewalk, surfacing and striping of a parking lot and access road, and aggregate surfacing of a trail.  This contract has multiple Notice to Proceeds and varying time periods for gaining access to and phasing portions of the work. 

Schedule A:  Approximately 70% of the project length requires open-graded friction course (OGFC) surfacing over existing hot-asphalt concrete pavement (HACP). The remainder of the project requires minor excavation and embankment to construct subgrade and surfacing at the project tie-ins to existing US93, pavement removal and roadway widening, drainage improvements (new pipe and drop inlet structures, slotted drains, adjustments to existing drop inlets, ditches, and riprap), W-beam and thrie-beam guardrail, wildlife fence, minor Portland cement concrete pavement (PCCP), and placing of aggregate base, HACP and OGFC. The project also includes concrete barriers, signing, and pavement marking throughout the entire alignment, interchange lighting and miscellaneous other work.  All work is in accordance with state and interstate design and construction standards.

Option X:  Work includes excavation and placement of waterline and sewerline conduit, placing aggregate base, HACP and PCCP surfacing, curb, and striping on the pedestrian plaza parking lot and access road, installing an electrical system through the parking lot and in the pedestrian plaza area, and miscellaneous minor work including aggregate surfacing of a trail.  

Public traffic currently uses existing US93 to access Hoover Dam from Nevada and Arizona, as well as two of the project interchange ramps and access roads near the end of the project causing impacts to construction of the tie-ins at the ends of the project and at the parking lot access road. Traffic delays and lane closures are subject to limitations. Construction sequencing and traffic control will be necessary for work within those areas of public traffic interaction. Access to mainline is anticipated to be at the ends of the project only with strict security requirements within the Hoover Dam Reservation area.

Active construction projects are ongoing within the project limits.  The Colorado River Bridge project is an integral part of the Hoover Dam Bypass located near the center of the project limits.  Access for any work within the designated areas of mainline occupied by the River Bridge contractor is restricted until the second NTP is issued.  Access to the parking lot, entrance road and trail is restricted until the third NTP is issued.  Coordination and access for the River Bridge Contractor’s operations must be maintained while both projects are under construction.  At the Arizona end of the project, an Arizona Department of Transportation project includes grading and surfacing improvements within the project limits and continuing to the south between US 93 Arizona milepost limits 2 and 17. Coordination for construction operations, moving materials and labor within the site, and for use or restriction of the roadways leading to and from the site is required. 

The work is anticipated to begin in January 2010 and end in December 2010 at the latest. This high-profile project is a critical link to transportation along the US93 corridor and ties in with roadway improvements to the south. Completion of this project removes the bottleneck at Hoover Dam and allows commercial trucking to resume using this section of the route.  As such, this contract includes substantial completion incentives for completing the work ahead of the scheduled completion date.  Significant disincentive penalties are also included in the contract.  

Estimated cost $8.0 to $10.0 million

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541712 with a business size standard of 500 employees.  An organization that is not considered a small business under NAICS code 541712 should not submit a response to this notice.

Background

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), National Institute of Health (NIH), is seeking a small business with the ability to serve as a Tissue Repository (TR) for a four-year continuation of the multi-center Lung Tissue Research Consortium (LTRC).  The overall objective of the LTRC is to enable better management of lung diseases by increasing understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms of these diseases through studies of human lung tissues. The LTRC facilitates histopathological and molecular research of pulmonary diseases by collecting lung tissues from donors and preparing and distributing collections of tissue specimens to researchers within and outside the Consortium. Collections of specimens are linked to extensive, individual clinical and phenotypic data.  This consortium is currently comprised of four Clinical Centers (CCs), a Data Coordinating Center (DCC), a Radiology Center (RC), and a center that serves as the Tissue Repository (TR).  

Project Requirements

The TR will 1) maintain and update LTRC protocols for specimen procurement, processing, transport, storage, and distribution; 2) train CC personnel regarding specimen handling, processing, and shipping to the TR; 3) conduct site visits as needed to assure that LTRC protocol procedures are followed; 4) perform quality control/quality assurance tests and report results to the DCC, including assays of RNA integrity; 5) process, aliquot, and store specimens received; 6) perform diagnostic, light-microscopic, histopathological analyses of lung tissues by a board-certified pathologist; 7) transmit a written report of diagnoses and any significant abnormalities found to the DCC and to the CC from which the tissue originated; 8) prepare and distribute specimens and collections of specimens to researchers, including microtome preparation of tissue slices; 9) coordinate with the DCC to maintain an accurate inventory of specimens, and 10) work with other LTRC investigators to prepare reports and manuscripts for publication. The Principal Investigator of the TR participates fully in the activities of the Steering Committee that manages overall operations of the LTRC.

THE PURPOSE OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS TO OBTAIN QUALIFICATION STATEMENTS FROM INTERESTED 8(A) JOINT VENTURERS (MENTOR PROTG FIRMS), HUBZONES, SMALLSERVICE DISABLED VETERAN OWNED BUSINESSES, AND OTHER SMALL BUSINESSES FOR PERFORMING THE WORK DESCRIBED IN THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.
The Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Specialty Center Acquisitions, NAVFAC (SCAN), is seeking qualified 8(a) Joint Venture (Mentor Protg), HUBZONE, Service Disabled Veteran Owned, and Other Small Business sources with current, relevant experience and the capacity/capability to perform energy-savings technology validation services.  The contractor shall install, demonstrate, and monitor equipment or materials, employing various energy savings technologies, as selected by NAVFAC ESC.The contractor shall plan, design-and-develop, install or construct, commission, monitor and provide operational and maintenance support for hardware, equipment, and systems specified by the Government. The Contractor shall provide operation and maintenance support for the hardware, equipment, and systems for the first year of performance after commissioning has been completed. The Contractor shall remove and dispose of the hardware, equipment, and systems if specified by the Government for individual delivery orders. The contractor must be able to support a minimum of two (2) installations of six (6) different technologies per year for a minimum of twelve (12) total demonstration projects per year at twelve (12) separate facilities.  Contractor must have the ability to simultaneously support construction at a minimum of four (4) separate sites involving four (4) different technologies.  
The Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center (NAVFAC ESC), in Port Hueneme CA, manages the Energy-Savings Technology Validation (Techval) program. The purpose of Techval is to investigate and validate energy saving technologies that are either newly introduced to the commercial market or that are on the market, but that are not widely used by the U.S. Navy. In addition, some technologies may still be in the developmental phase and not economically viable at this time.  The contractor shall install and demonstrate and monitor equipment or materials, employing various energy savings technologies, as selected by NAVFAC ESC. During and after the demonstration period NAVFAC ESC will advertise the results and provide guidance to energy managers and Energy Savings Contractors (ESCO) to facilitate widespread Navy use of these technologies. NAVFAC ESC will provide the following guidance and information to facilitate widespread Navy use: suggested use and application guidance, cost!  estimating and economic analysis guidance, and operation and maintenance manuals and documentation. This will increase awareness in the Navy of the newer technologies to show which ones are economical energy savers so that they will begin to be utilized throughout the Navy either through Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPCs) or other means.  In addition, NAVFAC ESC is tasked with performing RDT&E work mainly with renewable energy technologies.  Although most RDT&E work will either involve the integration of commercially available technologies, it could involve developing new energy storage devices, new adhesives for building integrated photovoltaics or other improvements in photovoltaics, wind turbines, development of technology used for production of power or transportation fuels from biomass, waste to energy, fuel cells, H2 production, power management and micro-grid development.  Also computer modeling of distributed multiple installation renewable energy systems! .  In addition, contractor must be able to perform economic analysis including life cycle cost, simple payback and return on investment.

<DESC>Sources Sought Synopsis

Title:  Technical assistance for developing a regulatory basis for rulemaking to streamline and  enhance the research and test reactor (RTR) license renewal process. 
 
This is a sources sought synopsis. This is not a Request for Proposals.


The NRC is seeking technical assistance for developing a regulatory basis for rulemaking to streamline and enhance the Research and Test Reactor (RTR) license renewal process.  This notice supports a market survey and analysis to determine the range of available contractors and their utility and capability to assist the NRC with the prospective work described below. The NRC does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request or compensate responders for their information. 

The purpose of this announcement is to provide potential sources the opportunity to submit information regarding their capabilities to perform work for the NRC free of Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCOI). For information on NRC OCOI regulations, visit NRC Acquisition Regulation Subpart 2009.5, entitled “Organizational Conflicts of Interest” (http://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/contracting/48cfr-ch20.html).  All interested parties, including all categories of small businesses (small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, 8(a) firms, women-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and HUBZone small businesses) are invited to submit a response to the market research questions below and submit the capability information as described below. Submission of additional materials such as glossy brochures or videos is discouraged. Responses are due no later than November 9, 2009. The Government will not reimburse respondents for any costs associated with submission of the requested information. Telephone inquiries or responses are not acceptable. Facsimile (301-492-3437) or email (mlita.carr@nrc.gov) responses are acceptable or responses may be mailed to: U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Attn: M`Lita Carr, Division of Contracts, MS TWB-01-A31M, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, MD 20852.

Background

The NRC is responsible for the licensing and regulatory oversight of research and test reactors (RTRs) in the United States. The NRC implements regulations and develops and implements policies, programs, and procedures pertaining to all aspects of licensing and inspection of these facilities.  The NRC is seeking to streamline and enhance the RTR license renewal process by proposed rulemaking.  Before proposed rulemaking can be initiated, a technical basis must be established which provides a detailed analysis of the current license renewal process and the basis for the proposed changes.

Capability Sought

The NRC is seeking to identify commercial organizations capable of providing technical assistance in the development of a technical basis that will be used to support rulemaking that will streamline and enhance the RTR license renewal process.  Included in the regulatory basis would be an examination of the technical, legal and policy issues associated with the proposed rulemaking.  The need to create or revise existing regulatory guidance documents would also have to be addressed. 

The commercial organization should have staff that has knowledge and/or practical experience with RTRs in the areas of design, fuel, operations, systems, nuclear physics, health physics, thermal hydraulics, and nuclear engineering sufficient to assess the acceptability of any proposed rulemaking.  The commercial organization should also have staff that has knowledge and/or practical experience with the current processes in 10 CFR Part 50, “Domestic Licensing of Production and Utilization Facilities”, as well as the guidance and acceptance criteria contained in NUREG-1537, “Guidelines for Preparing and Reviewing Applications for the Licensing of Non-Power Reactors,” and the NRC regulatory guides for RTRs.  All of these NRC’s regulations and guidance documents are available on the NRC’s public website at http://www.internal.nrc.gov/information-resources.html. 

Commercial organizations that are interested in supporting our technical assistance requirements should respond in writing to the market research questions below.  Additionally you should provide information on your staff’s qualifications and your firm’s corporate experiences and qualifications on similar contracts or efforts.

Market Research Questions

1.	How long has your business been in operation?

2.	What type of business is your company (i.e. 8(a), large, etc.)?

3.	What is the size of your company in terms of employees and consultants? Provide a breakdown of the mix between the two categories.

4.	Do you have dedicated office space in close proximity to NRC Headquarters in Rockville, MD 20852? (If desired, describe any office space alternatives.)

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.&nbsp; THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO THE USEPA REGION 8 START CONTRACTOR UNDER EP-W-05-050.&nbsp; REQUESTS AND/OR INQUIRIES WILL NOT BE ADDRESSED.&nbsp; IT IS THE INTENT OF THE USEPA TO AWARD A TASK ORDER UNDER AN EXISTING CONTRACT.&nbsp; The purpose of this Task Order (TO) #21 is to obligate $150,000 for a targeted Brownfields Assessment (TBA) of the Park County Shields River Branch Line Site located in and about the town of Livingston, in Park County, Montana.&nbsp; The period of performance will be from the date of award (anticipated to be during the week of October 5th, 2009)through February 28, 2010.&nbsp; Requirements for TO #21 include the following:&nbsp; 1) conducting site reconnaissance with USEPA to define scope of work; 2) preparing the initial field sampling plan based on the site recon; 3) conducting field sampling, anticipated to include several contaminents identified in the Phase I Report&nbsp;(sampling may include surface soils, subsurface soils and groundwater);&nbsp; 4) providing&nbsp;for laboratory analysis of samples;&nbsp; 5) preparing cost estimates for cleanup of contaminated zones; 6) preparing the draft and final Phase II Environmental Assessment Reports;&nbsp; 7) preparing the Property Profile Form (PPF); and, complying with the documentation and reporting requirements of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ("ARRA" or "the Act").&nbsp; The Act contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures.&nbsp; However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts.&nbsp; Although the Agency's START (Superfund Technical Assessment and Response Team) contracts were awarded as IDIQ contracts, they were awarded competitively with fixed rates, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the type of services to be performed.&nbsp; The existing START contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight&nbsp;to monitor contract performance and to mitigate the Government's risk.&nbsp; In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing START contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of ARRA.&nbsp;

This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquition Procedures (SAP) only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Linkages Workplace Consulting, LLC, a small business, in the only known source capable of meeting the Government's requirements due to the unique capability to provide support and service for the Geotechnical Laboratory. <BR><BR>Overview <BR>ERDC'S Geotechnical and Structures Laboratory is striving to build a culture of excellence and is putting many initiatives in place to achieve this objective. To this end, it is imperative that the Board of Directors work together as a high performing team. The foundation for a high performing team is trust, and trust is built through an awareness of our impact on others, shared expectations, and honoring agreements. High performing teams are able to make effective, timely and clear decisions by creating and fostering an atmosphere that encourages communication, risk taking and non-threatening conflict or debate. <BR>The Board of Directors consists of eight members (including Pat Sullivan). While each member of the Board currently works at a high level of individual competence, they are functioning at a lower level of team competence. Improving communication to increase the performance of this team is the broad intent of this initiative. <BR>The design of this initiative is based on Dr. Pulley's discussion with David Pittman, GSL Director, and several conversations with Pat Sullivan about the needs and desired outcomes for the Board of Directors. <BR>The information from these discussions is woven into the following intervention with the overall intent of improving communication and trust among the Board of Directors.<BR><BR>The initiative itself is a customized blend of assessment and team-based facilitation. It is designed and facilitated by Dr. Pulley, who has a deep background in leadership development and high performing teams, and has provided such services to organizations for over 20 years. <BR><BR>Methodology <BR>This initiative will take place over a 6-month period of time and will consist of three Phases. Each Phase will include a face-to-face off-site session and assessment (interviews, instrumentation, or both). The first session will take place over a 2-day period of time. The second Phase will take place three months later and the third Phase will take place three months after that. <BR>To some degree, the objectives and agenda for the second and third off-sites will emerge from the previous sessions. Each of these will include tracking of accountabilities. Detail for Phase 2 & 3 will be provided at least one month prior to when they take place. Dates for the three Phases are: <BR><BR>" November 4-5, 2009 <BR>" February 18, 2010 <BR>" May 4,2010 <BR><BR>PHASE 1 <BR><BR>Assessment<BR>" Each Board member will be interviewed by Dr. Pulley prior to the off-site session. Interviews will be face-to-face and will be 30 minutes long. Scheduling of interviews will require administrative support from GSL. Interviews will take place on November 3, 2009. Dr. Pulley will synthesize the interviews and share thematic results with the Board while maintaining confidentiality of individual members.<BR> <BR>" Each Board member will complete the Fundamental Interpersonal Relations Orientation-Behavior [FIRO-B] assessment, a 54-question tool that can be completed on Dr. Pulley's site that is linked to an online assessment system. The FIRO-B must be completed by all Board members by October 9, 2009. <BR><BR>" Each Board member will also complete a questionnaire about the functioning of the team. This questionnaire was customized and is used solely by Dr. Pulley and is tied to the Team Effectiveness Leadership Model [TELM]. The Team Effectiveness Leadership Model was created by Robert Ginnett and is based on his research of teams at NASA, commercial airline crews, surgical teams, management teams, and product and manufacturing teams. Ginnett worked closely with Richard Hackman, the Edgar Pierce Professor of Social and Organizational Psychology at Harvard and a leading expert on teams. This assessment will be administered online and must also be completed by October 9, 2009. <BR><BR>" Each Board member has completed the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator [MBTI] Step II through the Center for Creative Leadership. The MBTI is the most widely used and validated psychometric questionnaire in the world and is designed to measure psychological preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions. Step II is an extended version that provides additional depth and clarification of preferences. Each member's MBTI results will be sent to Dr. Pulley for team analysis no later than October 16, 2009. <BR>Off-Site (2 Days) <BR><BR>The objectives of this session are to: <BR><BR>" Introduce the TELM model as a framework for high performing teams. <BR>" Create a baseline of the team's current functioning. <BR>" Use the MBTI and FIRO-B as a basis for increasing the awareness of Board members' behaviors and the implications of stylistic differences. <BR>" Identify and agree to productive team norms. <BR>" Begin to clarify roles, responsibilities, and authority. <BR>" Begin to increase trust so that individuals will provide feedback directly to one another. <BR>" Begin to create an environment where disagreement is used in an open and positive way to make decisions and address complex challenges. <BR>Evaluation<BR><BR>Each Board member will be interviewed six months following the off-site and will be asked to provide behavioral examples of the team's functioning. These will be geared toward the following outcomes; outcomes that are considered to be indicative of high performing team behavior: <BR><BR>" The degree to which the Board is satisfying its stakeholders. <BR>" The degree to which the Board is learning (improving) as a team. <BR>" The degree to which each Board member experiences individual satisfaction as a part of this team. <BR><BR>Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to E. Renee James, ellaine.r.james@usace.army.mil - Contracting Office POC. (601-634-2396). Technical POC is Ms. Patricia M. Sullivan, 601-634-3065, patricia.m.sullivan@usace.army.mil.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p>Factor 5 - Enhanced 911 Service. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a detailed plan for interfacing and complying with State 911 requirements that meets the following criteria:<br />[a] A sound methodology of how the Offeror will comply with State 911 interface requirements for commercial subscriber lines and trunks.<br />[b] A sound methodology of their process for updating Automatic Line Identification 911 database.<br />[c] A description of alternating routes of 911. <br /><br /><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. CLINs/SLINs X002 and X003 within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B to derive the total evaluated price. CLIN X004, "Taxes, Fees, and Surcharges," will not be included in the total evaluated price. CLIN X004 will be awarded at a "Not to Exceed" (NTE) amount of the documented annual TFS plus a _5% escalation. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or any body with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs. The term includes the telecommunications facilities and equipment necessary to provide such services.<br />(u) Reporting of Funds. This contractual vehicle is used to authorize local communications services and does not obligate funds. The funded amount(s) indicate the yearly authorization totals for reporting purposes only.<br />(v) Tariff Information. <br />(1) The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer-<br />(i) Upon request, a copy of the Contractor's current existing tariffs (including changes);<br />(ii) Before filing, any application to a Federal, State, or any other regulatory agency for new or changes to, applicable rates, charges, services, or regulations relating to any CSA or any of the facilities or services to be furnished solely or primarily to the Government; and<br />(iii) Upon request, a copy of all information, material, and data developed or prepared in support of or in connection with an application under paragraph (a)(2) of this clause.<br />(2) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any application that anyone other than the Contractor files with a governmental regulatory body, which affects or will affect the rate or conditions of services under this contract. These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices, then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If during the term of the contract, the TFS's exceed the NTE amount, the contractor may submit a request for equitable adjustment (REA). The REA must document what TFS(s) changed to include supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A modification will then be issued to establish a new NTE amount based upon the newly documented annual TFS plus a _% escalation.<br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement. Failure to agree on any adjustment shall be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(w) Continuity of Services and Option to Extend Telecommunication Services. <br />(1) This Communications Service Authorization (CSA) authorizes continuation of services previously authorized on CSA F34608-98-H-5013-0050. <br />(2) For all services required on this contract, the contractor shall continue to provide services until a release date is established by the government as a result of competition (cutover complete) or termination (including termination for cause or government convenience). <br />(3) The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract until cutover is complete. These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders.

Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B. Orders must be signed by the Communications Systems Officer or designee.<br />(y) Posting Award Documents. Per FAR 5.303 and FAR 15.503(b), local announcements of contract awards, including Schedule Bs, are posted on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) at https://www.fbo.gov/.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<BR><BR>This synopsis is for a 100% small business solicitation W911QY-10-T-0001.  The solicitation will be prepared in accordance with FAR subpart 12.6.  The U.S. Army RDECOM, Natick Contracting Division has a requirement for commercially available Solar-Photovoltaic Power Supply. Offerors shall submit a one page past performance sheet consisting of two (in the past two years) references for the same or similar service.  It must contain a contacts name, contract/order number and a point of contacts telephone or fax number.  The North American Industry Code for this acquisition is 334416.  The size standard is 500 employees.  All responsible sources may submit a quote, which will be considered by this agency.   Quotes may be submitted via email to jonathan.lehmann@us.army.mil, fax (508) 233-4889 or sent by overnight or regular mail to Jonathan Lehmann c/o U.S. Army RDECOM, Natick Contracting Division ATTN: CCRD-NA-SY, 1 Kansas Street, Natick MA 01760-5011.  Questions may be addressed to Jonathan Lehmann via email at jonathan.lehmann@us.army.mil.  The closing time and date for proposals will not be later than 12 pm EDT October 19, 2009.<BR><BR>Introduction<BR><BR>The following describes a solar-photovoltaic power supply (SPPS) desired for purchase. The system is intended to support R&D; during evaluation efforts it will provide electricity to a variety of prototype military refrigerated container systems designed for solar power.<BR><BR>General Requirements<BR><BR>The near-term application is a prototype refrigerated TriCon currently being built by Mainstream Engineering of Rockledge, FL. Offerors should contact Greg Cole at Mainstream (321-631-3550) when preparing a response to this solicitation. It will also be used for future projects of a similar nature.  The desired SPPS, besides comprising an electrically-connected array of solar modules, includes shelter material for module mounting, and poles and rigging, so that 1) it can provide refuge from rain or sun, 2) the usefulness of the area under its footprint is preserved, and 3) the modules can be angled -- i.e., generally slanted, and static -- toward the sun for more effective energy harvesting.<BR><BR>In addition to the array and structure, the system shall include an electrical enclosure providing power conversion and conditioning equipment -- i.e., the balance of system -- that renders the DC output of the array useable to typical military and civilian electrically-powered equipment.  To provide a reasonable Return on Investment balanced against transported and deployed system size and weight, the SPPS must provide enough electricity to significantly offset the fuel used to drive a refrigeration unit. Practically speaking, the nominal power output that achieves this balance is currently estimated to be 2 kW.<BR><BR>The SPPS must be durable enough to withstand rugged military usage over its<BR>lifetime.<BR><BR>Detail of Desired Characteristics<BR><BR>More detailed expectations of the SPPS item to be purchased are as follows:<BR><BR>Footprint: The fully-deployed solar photovoltaic power supply system shall not occupy a footprint exceeding 100 feet x 60 feet.<BR><BR>Environment: The SPPS shall operate properly and the equipment shall not be adversely affected by ambient relative humidity between 0 and 100%, ambient temperatures from -25 to 125F, and shall withstand storage temperatures of -60 to 160F without adverse consequences to subsequent operation, performance or equipment. All components and connections shall be protected from the effects of fungus growth and moisture.<BR><BR>Wind Load: The SPPS shall be capable of being assembled in winds of 25 mph, and when fully erected shall withstand gusts from any direction without adverse consequences to operation, performance or equipment.<BR><BR>Rain: The SPPS shall not pool water and shall withstand sustained downpours, including horizontally windblown rain, without adverse consequences to operation, performance or equipment.<BR><BR>Structural members. Any structural item -- to include the photovoltaic modules, module support material, poles, tethers, mounting/securing points, attachments, etc. -- shall be engineered to meet all expected wind load criteria, pre-stress loads and installation loads.<BR><BR>Wiring: All cables and wires shall meet National Electric Code (NEC) requirements for extreme environments, mobile systems and safety. Cables and wires shall be routed and secured to ensure safety, and so that they do not hinder or obstruct equipment maintenance or portability. All wire colors shall be in accordance with the NEC. All electrical components shall have their voltage, current and maximum power labeled in close proximity to their connectors.<BR><BR>Tools: Any specialty tools required for deployment or maintenance will be included with the system. A minimum of specialty tools is a positive characteristic<BR><BR>Durability: The SPPS shall withstand at least 50 setups and strikes without subsequent structural, performance or operational degradation.<BR><BR>Error-proof assembly: To assist assembly and installation, and preclude improper assembly or installation, the SPPS shall incorporate the following:<BR>1. Physical measures to prevent interchange of items of a same or similar form that are not in fact functionally interchangeable.<BR>2. Physical measures to prevent improper assembly or mounting of units or components.<BR>3. Physical measures to facilitate proper assembly or mounting of items.<BR>4. Measures (e.g., coding) to facilitate identification and interchange of interchangeable items.<BR><BR>Voltage: The nominal and maximum open circuit voltage of the SPPS shall be in<BR>the range 48-72 volts DC output to the balance of system. This voltage shall not fall below 29 volts while the array experiences at least 100 W/m2 of incident sunlight.<BR><BR>Power: The power output of the SPPS shall be no less than 2.75 kW at 1000 W/m2 in a 25C environment. The power output shall not decrease more than 0.3 %/K as the temperature deviates from 25C.<BR><BR>Human performance: Setup and teardown shall require no more than three soldiers.<BR><BR>Value Determination<BR><BR>Value of the systems offered will be judged primarily on the following criteria, and weighted in this order:<BR><BR>1. Adherence to the above detailed characteristics. Failing to meet a characteristic will result in a judgment that the product is of lesser value. Products exceeding the characteristics will be judged to be of greater value. Offerors are encouraged to highlight additional benefits of their system that may or may not be related to the desired characteristics.<BR>2. Simpler designs -- consistent with the desired functional characteristics -- will be judged of greater value. Simplicity includes factors such as operability, setup, teardown, parts count, specialty tools, and field maintainability by minimally trained personnel.<BR>3. Durability and reliability are of high value.<BR>4. Lower weight is of high value.<BR>5. Lower transport cube is of high value.<BR>6. A shorter duration from order to delivery is of high value.<BR><BR>Evaluation After Purchase<BR><BR>We expect to be using the SPPS during multiple laboratory and field evaluations to supply power to prototype solar-enabled military refrigeration systems. Offerors should be aware that in parallel we will be evaluating the SPPS equipment for suitability to military use. There are many characteristics that can only be evaluated during a period of ownership. Over the long term, we will be examining items such as safety, human factors, labeling, workmanship, quality of materials and assembly integrity, reparability, durability, and changes in performance over time.

Examples showing the same chamber as that required, provided under the same terms (installation, warranty, documentation), provided to a Government agency in the U.S., and performed within the past three years, will be considered ideal in terms of relevance. Variations (a similar system rather than the same system, lesser warranty, or no documentation required) will be considered accordingly.  Quality will be evaluated in the following areas (the listing does not represent the specific or relative importance of the areas, nor necessarily all areas):  timeliness of overall delivery;  quality of the system; quality of the installation;  ability to deal with any required changes;  providing warranty; and meeting customer overall expectations and overall customer satisfaction.  In the case of an offeror without a re cord of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.<BR><BR>(b) Options. There are no options required in the solicitation.<BR><BR>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined necessary by the Contracting Officer.

(vii) REQUIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE:  The Contractor shall ship all products to the locations listed in each individual DO via any proposed shipping method; see Attachment E, “Field Unit Addresses”, for the USCG Unit addresses; it is expected that deliveries under this IDIQ contract will be within the Continental United States (CONUS) only.  Deliveries will be made to the “ship to” address within twelve weeks from the issuance of each DO.

Offerors shall include in the proposal its detailed commercial warranty terms and process. 

In the specification document, items followed by the word "Threshold" are minimum requirements or performance that the proposed product must have. Items followed by the word "Objective" represent desirable increases in operational capabilities. These “Objective” requirements or any portion thereof, as well as any other items or increased performance capabilities the Offeror considers desirable or to add value, may be offered.

Volume II shall contain (a) a completed Attachment B, “Pricing Scenario”, as well as a price breakdown of the proposed product by entering the respective unit prices and extended prices for the CLINS listed, and (b) the Offerors Representations and Certifications required by the provision at 52.212-3 IF they are not listed at the ORCA database.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS: It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Commandant (CG-9131), ATTN: Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, United States Coast Guard, 2100 2nd St SW STOP 7112, Washington, DC 20593-7112; FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<DESC><p>Combined synopsis/soliciation for an Explosive Decompression Test Facility at Tinker Air Force Base, OK.<br /><br />Amendment 0001: This requirement was originally posted as a 100% Small Business set-aside. The set-aside has since been removed and this requirement has been amended to allow for full and open competition.<br /><br />Amendment 0002: As of 2 Oct 2009, the response date has been extended.</p>
<p>The original soliciation&nbsp;and&nbsp;any amendments&nbsp;are provided as&nbsp;attachments to this notice.&nbsp; The solicitation and any amendments must be signed and returned as a part of&nbsp;any offer.&nbsp; A copy of the statement of work is provided in the original solicitation document.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Any questions may be submitted via e-mail to the above individual.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A site visit was held on 14 Sept 2009. The following is a list of the companies that attended:</p>
<p>1. High Tech Services - Richardson, TX<br />2. Reimers Systems-Lorton, VA<br />3. SAIC-Midwest City, OK<br />4. Virtual Technology Services-Midwest City, OK</p>
<p><br /><strong>Q &amp; A</strong></p>
<p>1. Can any of the existing electrical disconnect boxes be relocated or deleted?</p>
<p>ANS. The disconnect labeled "Breaker Box for The Circulation Pump" has power running to it however it is no longer connected to a load so it can be removed along with the feed running to it.</p>
<p>ANS. The disconnect labeled for the Vibration System is located just north of the Circulation Pump Disconnect. This disconnect is in use but it will be moved approximately 6 ft north along the west wall and reinstalled there.</p>
<p>ANS. The disconnect which powered the chiller and is now the source of power for the blower/sucker fan will require reinstallation to the north approximately 8 feet.</p>
<p>2. If the large air duct can be relocated?</p>
<p>ANS. The large air duct can be relocated to the north and reconnected to the blower/sucker fan in its present location provided C.E. grants permission for the additional penetration of the wall and the old vacant hole is properly sealed to their standards.</p>
<p>3. Can the chilled water lines be relocated to the south wall?</p>
<p>ANS. In room 119 the chill water lines can be located to the south wall if they are then run north into the trench as they provide cooling for the shaker and the environmental chamber via their path through the trench.</p>
<p>4. Will there be a requirement for any pass-thru conduit to the outside?</p>
<p>ANS. I see the possible necessity for two conduits. One would be for transducer wiring from the accumulator tank, air duct, and vacuum pumps to the control system located in room 119. The other would be for a compressed air line if the design calls for pneumatic actuators to be used on the system.</p>
<p>5. Can we either come out and take some photo's or if Mr. Fleenor has already taken some can he send them to us?</p>
<p>ANS.I have provided the photos which I took and annotated to Michelle Syth. She will make copies available in accordance with their procedures. If she or her supervisors have no objections I am agreeable to someone coming to take additional photos, measurements, or asking questions whenever I am present.<br />**The photos are posted as an attachment to this notice**</p>
<p>6. How accurate does the pressure profile have to be?<br />ANS. +/- 5/3% (1.6) percent of the value or +/- 200/3 Pa, whichever is greater. Per Mil-Std-810F Part One 5.2 Tolerances for test conditions and Part One 5.3.2 Calibration</p>
<p>7. Does the profile have to be linear or parabolic?</p>
<p>ANS. For the purpose of our testing a linear time history showing the change in engineering units (EUs) of pressure per unit of time in milliseconds is all that is needed.</p>
<p>8. What software is preferred for data acquisition system of EDTF?</p>
<p>ANS. No preference, Labview is ok as it is being used in some of the other systems in the lab, but it is not a requirement.</p>
<p>9. Can the bid documents be submitted by email by 5th of October? If paper documents are requested, how many copies are required?</p>
<p>ANS. As of 24 Sep 2009, the documents are due by 5 Oct 2009 (see solicitation for exact response time). One completed copy of both the original solicitation and any amendments are required to be submitted. E-mailed documents are preferred, however they may also be submitted via facsimile.</p>
<p>10. Will the vacuum pump on the EDTF be used for other purposes in addition to the EDTF or is it dedicated only to the EDTF?</p>
<p>ANS. The vacuum pump on the EDTF is for one purpose only, the EDTF.<br /><br />11. Are there any quality standards in addition to those listed in the SOW?</p>
<p>ANS. The accuracy and performance of the test system controls and data acquisition must meet or exceed the associated requirements of MIL-STD-810F. Construction and fabrication of the facility shall be in compliance with prevailing Tinker AFB, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma County, and State of Oklahoma applicable laws and regulations as well as national rules, regulations, laws, and codes as they may apply. As an example would be National Electrical code.</p>
<p><br />12. Will user training be required?</p>
<p>ANS. Training Requirements will be limited by the delivery of Operation Manuals covering maintenance of the Vacuum Pump, Actuators, and Other Moving Components as well as an Operation Manual detailing the functions of the Graphical Interface Icons of the Control Software used to manage test parameters and Data Acquisition.</p>
<p>The EDTF Control Software shall enable Data Acquisition parameter selection such as Sampling Rates up to 50k Samples per Second.</p>
<p>Accumulator Pressure shall be expressed in kPa, psia, torrs, or Inches of Mercury.<br />Chamber Pressure/Altitude and Change of Rate, both positive and negative, shall both be expressed in selectable units of Meters (Altitude) - psia - kPa per Second or Minute for Change of Rate. Pressure is to be expressed in Meters (Altitude)-psia &amp; kPa.</p>

<DESC>This is an amendment to extend the response date of a previous synopsis.  All offered properties received under the previous posting will still be considered and do not need to be resubmitted.The Samuel S. Stratton Veterans Affairs Medical Center (Hereafter "VA"), located at 113 Holland Ave., Albany NY 12208, plans to solicit the market and make competitive award of a Real Property Lease Agreement for approximately 2,500 gross (2,000 ANSI/BOMA Net Usable) square feet of outpatient clinic space located within ten miles of Northway (US Route 87) Exit 31 in the state of New York.  The space must include at least 10 patient parking spaces, with an additional 7 for VA staff/Government Vehicles preferred.  At least two patient spaces must be marked as handicapped and located directly adjacent to the building entrance.The ten-mile geographic radius will be measured directly, independent of landscape (i.e., "as the crow flies").  The specified radius includes the villages of Elizabethtown and Westport, NY.  The radius will be strictly enforced and the VA will not accept or consider offers from beyond its boundaries.The anticipated lease agreement would be for a five-year base term with one five-year option to be exercised by the unilateral action of the VA. The VA is willing to consider two different types of responses to fulfill this need.  The first ("Type 1") is a standard fit-out ready stand-alone building or suite with active utility connections that can be modified to meet the general needs and floor plan of a VA Community-Based Outpatient Clinic (i.e., a "warm, lit shell").  This structure may be existing, or constructed as a build-to-suit project.  The VA would be the sole occupant of this space once fit-out appropriately for its use.  The VA would anticipate amortizing the cost of any fit-out/construction into the monthly rental payments to be made to the lessor across the five-year base term of the lease.The second type ("Type 2") is space within an active practitioner's office or area of practice set up for use as a fully-functioning medical clinic that is used part-time or not completely utilized.  The VA would rent this space on a part-time basis to provide standard primary care outpatient services in during specific windows of availability.  The VA would need access to this space for a full 8-hour day at least twice per week on weekdays (8:00 AM - 4:30 PM).  It is anticipated that acceptable space of this type would require minimal fit-out or modification for the VA's use (or, ideally, none).  The VA would need access to high-speed internet (e.g., T-1 or Fiber-Optic) and all other utilities.  The existing furniture and potentially medical equipment would be utilized by VA staff to treat VA patients.The VA will make a decision about which space type to limit its consideration to based upon the results of this synopsis.  The VA will NOT conduct an open competition in which both types of space compete against one another.A beneficial occupancy date, with the space fully modified and prepared for the VA's use to see patients, is required no later than May 1, 2010.  Evaluation will likely take into account whether the offered space could be made ready for VA use prior to that date.  Existing clinical space to be shared (Type 2) would be expected to be available much sooner.Interested parties are required to send an email to Jason.White@va.gov, Rachael.Roney@va.gov, and Sonja.Stroud@va.gov to request a market survey of their available property.  This email must be received no later than October 16, 2009.  The email must include a point of contact name, telephone number, email address, the physical address of the property, the available square footage, asking price (if available), space type (referencing type 1 or 2 above), and a general overview of the building's age, condition, prior/current use, and available utilities.Following October 16, the VA will determine which space type to pursue (Type 1 or 2), and begin the process of formal market surveys at each offered site.  This market survey will consist of a group of VA stakeholders visiting and evaluating each offered space to make a go/no-go determination of whether the space currently meets or can be made to meet the VA's needs.  These market surveys are anticipated to occur during standard business hours in the month of October, and will require the building owner or a designee pre-approved by the VA to be present.  Market surveys are typically 30 minutes to 90 minutes in length.Following market surveys, the VA will release a Solicitation for Offers (SFO) to owners of spaces which were rated as a "go" during the market survey.  This SFO will specify a time period in which offerors must prepare a full, signed lease offer and submit the offer to the VA for final evaluation.  The VA may conduct discussions (negotiations) as necessary with offerors to reach a final, best-value decision regarding the ultimate award of a lease.  All correspondence regarding this synopsis, the resulting solicitation, and the ultimate award of this lease must be conducted exclusively with the Contracting Officer and/or a designee thereof.  The approved designees for this procurement are Mr. Jason White, Contract Specialist, (518) 626-6844, Ms. Rachael Roney, Contract Specialist,  (518) 626-6137, and Ms. Sonja Stroud, Contract Specialist, (518) 626-6139

This market survey will consist of a group of VA stakeholders visiting and evaluating each offered space to make a go/no-go determination of whether the space currently meets or can be made to meet the VA's needs.  These market surveys are anticipated to occur during standard business hours in the month of October, and will require the building owner or a designee pre-approved by the VA to be present.  Market surveys are typically 30 minutes to 90 minutes in length.Following market surveys, the VA will release a Solicitation for Offers (SFO) to owners of spaces which were rated as a "go" during the market survey.  This SFO will specify a time period in which offerors must prepare a full, signed lease offer and submit the offer to the VA for final evaluation.  The VA may conduct discussions (negotiations) as necessary with offerors to reach a final, best-value decision regarding the ultimate award of a lease.  All correspondence regarding this synopsis, the resulting solicitation, and the ultimate award of this lease must be conducted exclusively with the Contracting Officer and/or a designee thereof.  The approved designees for this procurement are:Mr. Jason White, Contract Specialist      (518) 626-6844 Ms. Rachael Roney, Contract Specialist  (518) 626-6137 Ms. Sonja Stroud, Contract Specialist      (518) 626-6139

<DESC>To Commercial Off the Shelf Vendors, System Integrators and IT Service Providers:
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation's (PBGC) is conducting market research to determine how PBGC can most efficiently implement an investment portfolio management and actuarial accounting interface (trust fund management). Integral to PBGC's IT governance practices, PBGC conducts Architecture and Investment Planning activities prior to implementing IT solutions. This investment planning analysis supports the replacement of multiple feeder systems to PBGC's general ledger, the Core Financial System (CFS). These feeder systems perform two critical activities in the management of PBGC's Trust Fund: 1) Investment Portfolio Management Accounting System (currently using PAM Securities), and 2) the compilation of Actuarial Accounting Interface(s) for financial statement reporting. <br />Data from this Request for Information (RFI) and PBGC's enterprise architecture analysis will be used for investment planning purposes. Increasingly, the PBGC is becoming more reliant on technology as the enabling agent for meeting management's need to streamline underlying financial and administrative processes. The PBGC places a high degree of importance on information technology as a financial investment, and understands the necessity to manage this investment wisely.<br />Scope of Information Request:<br />We are researching a solution to propose the optimal solution and services for replacing PBGC's trust fund management systems. We are requesting COTS Vendors, System Integrators and IT Service Providers (including Banks) to indicate the optimal solution and services for PBGC based on the information provided in attached market research request document. (KPMG, LLP is helping the PBGC with the analysis).</p>
<p>In response to this market research and information request, please provide the following:<br />o An updated version of Attachment A to this document. We request that your organization complete this spreadsheet indicating how you plan to satisfy PBGC key requirements.<br />o An updated version of Attachment B to this document outlining a 5-year cost estimate starting October 2010 to include planning, implementation, and post-go-live support.<br />o Identify current clients that utilize your firm's solutions and services, please highlight any clients that may have a similar transaction volume as the PBGC. <br />o Any additional information that you feel will assist PBGC in assessing alternatives for a solution.<br />Please advise if you will be able to provide the information requested and submit any questions to Tracy Soforenko (Soforenko.Tracy@pbgc.gov) and Roland Thomas (<a href="mailto:thomas.roland@pbgc.gov">thomas.roland@pbgc.gov</a>) by 4:00 PM on 10/5/2009</p>
<p>Please further respond with the above requested information by 4:00 PM on 10/16/2009.</p>
<p>We appreciate your interest in supporting the future financial management technology needs of the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation.</p>

This information must be provided in order to determine eligibility – DO NOT SEND COPIES OF YOUR CCR PROFILE; 

(3) letter from bonding agent stating your firm’s capability to bond for a single project of $10.0 million, and your firm’s aggregate bonding capacity; and

(4) Provide a list of interstate highway type construction projects documenting experience in traffic control, sequencing and phasing, earthwork, HACP production and placement, OGFC production and placement, PCCP production and placement, concrete barrier, parking area electrical system installation, and interstate type interchange lighting, signing, and drainage appurtenance installation.  Also include road construction projects that required management of extensive multidisciplinary performance and interrelated construction operations.  State whether your firm was the prime contract or subcontractor on the project(s).  DO NOT SEND INFORMATION ON PROJECTS THAT DO NOT INCLUDE THE ABOVE WORK.
 
The size of a small business firm includes all parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, etc.  Refer to the Code of Federal Regulations 13 CFR 121.103 for information on how the SBA determines affiliation and 13 CFR 121.108 regarding the penalties for misrepresentation of size status.  All firms should be certified in the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) located at https://orca.bpn.gov/

A Qualified HUBZone SBC receiving a HUBZone contract for general construction must spend at least 50% of the cost of the contract incurred for personnel on its own employees or employees of other qualified HUBZone SBCs.  This requirement may be met by expending at least 50% of the cost of the contract incurred for personnel on its employees or it may subcontract at least 35% of the cost of the contract performance incurred for personnel to one or more qualified HUBZone SBCs.  A qualified HUBZone SBC prime contractor may not, however, subcontract more than 50% of the cost of the contract incurred for personnel to non-qualified HUBZone SBCs.

PROJECT DETAILS:  This project is located about 30 miles southeast of Las Vegas, Nevada, on US93 within the Hoover Dam Reservation Area and Lake Mead National Recreation Area.  The alignment crosses the Arizona/Nevada state line as a US93 Bypass of Hoover Dam.   

The project consists of Schedule A and Option X.  Schedule A includes final roadway improvements along the 4.4 miles of new mainline alignment along with interchange ramps and access roads near each end of the project. Option X, if exercised, includes utilities, sidewalk, surfacing and striping of a parking lot and access road, and aggregate surfacing of a trail.  This contract has multiple Notice to Proceeds and varying time periods for gaining access to and phasing portions of the work. 

Schedule A:  Approximately 70% of the project length requires open-graded friction course (OGFC) surfacing over existing hot-asphalt concrete pavement (HACP). The remainder of the project requires minor excavation and embankment to construct subgrade and surfacing at the project tie-ins to existing US93, pavement removal and roadway widening, drainage improvements (new pipe and drop inlet structures, slotted drains, adjustments to existing drop inlets, ditches, and riprap), W-beam and thrie-beam guardrail, wildlife fence, minor Portland cement concrete pavement (PCCP), and placing of aggregate base, HACP and OGFC. The project also includes concrete barriers, signing, and pavement marking throughout the entire alignment, interchange lighting and miscellaneous other work.  All work is in accordance with state and interstate design and construction standards.

Option X:  Work includes excavation and placement of waterline and sewerline conduit, placing aggregate base, HACP and PCCP surfacing, curb, and striping on the pedestrian plaza parking lot and access road, installing an electrical system through the parking lot and in the pedestrian plaza area, and miscellaneous minor work including aggregate surfacing of a trail.  

Public traffic currently uses existing US93 to access Hoover Dam from Nevada and Arizona, as well as two of the project interchange ramps and access roads near the end of the project causing impacts to construction of the tie-ins at the ends of the project and at the parking lot access road. Traffic delays and lane closures are subject to limitations. Construction sequencing and traffic control will be necessary for work within those areas of public traffic interaction. Access to mainline is anticipated to be at the ends of the project only with strict security requirements within the Hoover Dam Reservation area.

Active construction projects are ongoing within the project limits.  The Colorado River Bridge project is an integral part of the Hoover Dam Bypass located near the center of the project limits.  Access for any work within the designated areas of mainline occupied by the River Bridge contractor is restricted until the second NTP is issued.  Access to the parking lot, entrance road and trail is restricted until the third NTP is issued.  Coordination and access for the River Bridge Contractor’s operations must be maintained while both projects are under construction.  At the Arizona end of the project, an Arizona Department of Transportation project includes grading and surfacing improvements within the project limits and continuing to the south between US 93 Arizona milepost limits 2 and 17. Coordination for construction operations, moving materials and labor within the site, and for use or restriction of the roadways leading to and from the site is required. 

The work is anticipated to begin in January 2010 and end in December 2010 at the latest. This high-profile project is a critical link to transportation along the US93 corridor and ties in with roadway improvements to the south. Completion of this project removes the bottleneck at Hoover Dam and allows commercial trucking to resume using this section of the route.  As such, this contract includes substantial completion incentives for completing the work ahead of the scheduled completion date.  Significant disincentive penalties are also included in the contract.  

Estimated cost $8.0 to $10.0 million

<DESC>NOTE:  SUBMISSIONS ARE DUE BY NOON, MST, OCTOBER 7TH, 2009 instead of Oct. 8th.
General:  The National Park Service (NPS), Department of Interior, is seeking responses from construction contractors who would have the capability and interest in single or multiple construction contracts for abandoned mine closures varying in magnitude in California, Arizona, and Washington.  Hubzone, 8(a), Service Disaled Veteran, and small businesses should express their interest at this time.  A solicitation is not being issued at this time, as the Government is conducting market research to locate interested, qualified contractors.  Prospective offerors desiring to conduct business with DOI are requested to register at the National lBusiness Center.  Response to this notice must be received timely to be considered.
Title of Project:  Install Gates or Otherwise Close Abandoned Mines to Protect Visitors and Preserve Resource Habitat
Description:  The NPS will be undertaking a series of projects aimed at improving visitor and staff safety and resource protection at a number of abandoned mine lands sites.  Potential mitigation measures include mine closures, entrance/portal reconstruction, exclusionary gates, cable nets, fences, bat compatible gates or cupolas, polyurethane foam and earthen backfill, site restoration through recontouring the landscape and planting native vegetation, blasting, and other measures.
The park units with current requirements include the following:  Death Valley National Park, Mojave National Preserve, Whiskeytown National Recreation Area, Joshua Tree National Park, Lake Mead National Recreation Area, Olympic National Park, Parashant National Monument, and Mount Rainier National Park.  The following list summarizes the approximate number of mine openings requiring attention in each park:
Death Valley National Park:  300 -- 400Mojave National Preserve:  180Mount Rainier National Park:  7Whiskeytown National Recreation Area:  12Olympic National Park:  1Lake Mead National Recreation Area:  20Parashant National Monument:  17Joshua Tree National Park:  32
Access to the mine sites varies from sites that are adjacent to unpaved roads to sites that are accessible only by foot or helicopter.  Many sites are level but others are on steep hillsides and at high elevations.  Most sites would be considered to be in remote locations.
Type of Procurement:  Negotiated firm-fixed price contracts will be awarded.  There will be multiple solicitations with a possible range in magnitude from fewer than 10 openings to more than 100 openings. It may be determined that Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contract vehicles are appropriate for parts of the work.  There is no Government preference for the size of vendors or set-aside program at this time.  It is anticipated that a mix of programs/contract vehicles will be used to satisfy the broad Government requirement.  The responses received to this and other market research efforts will help determine the Government's strategy.  Hubzone, 8(a), Service Disabled Veteran, and small businesses should express their interest at this time and clearly identify their size/program status.
Interested contractors must provide a letter of interest with qualifications and experience.  Please include relevant experience for similar work (mine closures) and ability to perform at remote sites.  Responses of interest must be submitted by noon MST on Wednesday, October 7th, 2009.

<DESC>Q. Does 100% Small Business set-aside indicate all consultants, prime and sub-consultants must be a Small Businesses?
A.  For any small business set-aside contract, the Limitations on Subcontracting Clause (FAR 52.219-14) must be included.  For this contract the prime must perform at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel with its own employees.  A small business can certainly use a large business as a subcontractor/teaming partner; however, in a prime to sub relationship, the prime must perform the required percentage of work.  In the case of a joint venture (small/large business), then the joint venture (JV) is the prime and must adhere to the clause.  The JV must be considered small for the procurement.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   Questions and Answers for RFQ-DC-09-00298Atmospheric Mercury Monitoring Services
Question 1.  Will there be any future RFPs with associated funds for start-up and operation of new monitoring sites? 
Answer 1:  No plans at this time for any future RFQs and/or RFPs.
Question 2.  Can state agencies participate on this current acquisition?  
Answer 2:   Yes
Question 3.  What is the time period for the Mercury monitoring services?  
Answer 3:  The time period is estimated to be one year from date of award is approximate.  Award is anticipated before the end of December 2009.
Question 4.   Pricing Regarding the Period of Performance:   
Answer 4:  Interested parties are required to price out all years (Base and Option Years).  Utilizing a spreadsheet type document in word format is acceptable.
Question 5.  Are there any minimums or maximums for the quotes to be provided for the services?
Answer 5:  There are no minimums or maximums for this acquisition.  However, the Government is estimating services at five sites (not guaranteed).  
Question 6.   Standard Form 18 is not a mandatory.  
Answer 6:  Although Standard Form 18 is not a mandatory requirement; all submitted quotes must include the participant's mailing address, remittance address, duns number, tax I.D. business size status (large, small, woman owned, etc).   Also, participants are reminded that they must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry at https://www.bpn.gov/ccr Question 7.     Statement of Work, paragraph 4, 1st sentence says:  "EPA envisions awarding contracts for monitoring services at up to five existing monitoring sites to operate Tekran mercury speciation systems as part of NADP.  Also, Technical Evaluation Factors, paragraph 1, 2nd sentence says: "The Government may award up to five (5) individual contract awards to responsive, responsible firms whose proposal is the most advantageous to the Government.  Also,  Technical Evaluation Factors, Price Evaluation, does not specify the number of sites to be priced.Does this information mean that contractors are limited to pricing a maximum of 5 existing monitoring sites in their proposal?  If yes, may a contractor submit more than one proposal and be awarded more than one contract if that contractor can demonstrate that more than 5 existing monitoring sites meet the mercury monitoring goals of item 4 in the Technical Evaluation Factors?  Alternatively, in a single proposal may a contractor submit prices for as many existing monitoring sites as can be demonstrated meet the mercury monitoring goals of item 4 in the Technical Evaluation Factors?  

Answer 7:     The Government will make an award to one contractor per available site.  No contractor will be awarded more than one site under this acquisition. 
Question 8.  Extension to the RFQ due date for receipt of quotes:
Answer 8:  None will be granted - the due date for receipt of quotes remains October 13, 2009. 
Question 9.  Confidential information requested from previous or current contractor sources.
Answer 9:  Confidential information provided from previously received or current potential RFQ sources will not be provided in order to protect the integrity of the acquisition process.  
Question 10.  Start date of awarded services.
Answer 10:  Services will start within 30 days of notice of award, therefore the site has a maximum of 30 days to begin operation upon award of a contract.  Question 11. Notice regarding Performance Evaluation.  

Answer 11:  New potential monitoring site/contractors are not precluded from applying to this RFQ due to a lack of long-term monitoring record; presence of a long-term record is one of many technical evaluation factors up for consideration of award.  
All other terms and conditions of the RFQ remains unchanged.

SYNOPSIS
The U.S. Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA),   National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the Pipeline Research Council International (PRCI) are partnering to develop and apply remote sensing technology in the detection and mitigation of threats to pipeline integrity, including leak detection technology having application to carbon cycle science.  This partnership is soliciting information on related remote sensing instrument technology as described in this Request for Information (RFI). Information is being gathered to assess and evaluate the performance and capabilities of current technologies, including available technologies that are commercially off-the-shelf systems (COTS), as well as promising and emerging technologies that advance this program toward the end state vision. From the information responses, PHMSA, NASA and PRCI plan to select several technologies for demonstration projects. Successful demonstration projects may serve as the new technology prototypes for the PRCI member companies as they infuse new technology into their operational systems.  PRCI is a non-profit collaborative organization representing 39 of the world’s leading energy transportation pipeline companies, as well as technology developers and other organizations supporting the energy pipeline transportation industry. 
PHMSA and NASA have established a Memorandum of Understanding to work cooperatively on the Right-of-way Automated Monitoring (RAM) Program.  PHMSA, NASA and the pipeline industry working through PRCI, have initiated a multi-year effort to substantially advance the pipeline industry’s capability in detecting, identifying, communicating, and responding to the three (3) primary threats to pipeline operation and security:

1. Mechanical damage caused by third-party equipment and unauthorized    intrusion/encroachment;
2. Changes and ground disturbance caused by man-made activity and natural phenomenon (i.e., geologic and geophysical activity); and
3. Small leaks from operating systems.

** See attached document for full details regarding this RFI. **

There will be a formal partnering process throughout the design and construction phases to promote successful project development and execution through voluntary commitments to accomplish established agreed-upon project objectives by all involved parties.</p>
<p>The estimated cost for the design-build delivery of the new Data Center is between $65,000,000 and $80,000,000.</p>
<p>Opportunities for other than Large Businesses: This procurement will be open to large and small business firms. Any qualified responsible firm, including small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business is encouraged to participate as a prime contractor or as a member of a joint venture with other small businesses, or as a subcontractor Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d), FAR subpart 19.702 and FAR subpart 19.12. An Offeror that is not a small business concern, offering to perform a contract that has subcontracting possibilities, must submit a Subcontracting Plan that is acceptable to the Contracting Officer which provides subcontracting opportunities to small businesses to the maximum extent practicable. In this procurement, GSA intends to promote contractors' and subcontractors' use of registered Apprenticeship Programs.</p>
<p>NOTICE TO OFFERORS<br />GSA intends to award a firm-fixed price Design-Build Contract based upon 20% bridging documents and Program of Requirements which will be provided with the Request for Proposal during Phase II of the acquisition process for this procurement pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures, FAR Subpart 36.3, Source Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3 and the GSA Design Excellence Program. For this contract award process, GSA will issue two Solicitations in sequence: 1) Phase One, and 2) Phase Two. The Phase One procedure (which is analogous to a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) is designed to select a "short list" of the most highly qualified Offerors who will be requested to submit Phase Two proposals. All responsible sources may submit a Phase One Proposal. A maximum of up to five (5) firms will be short listed unless the contracting officer determines that a number greater than five (5) is in the Government's best interest. The most highly rated Offerors will be selected to participate in Phase Two (analogous to Request for Proposals (RFP)).<br /><br />A best value concept will be applied for evaluation of offers and selection of the successful Offeror for this procurement. The best value approach provides the opportunity to select an Offeror who is not necessarily the lowest-priced or the highest technically-ranked. GSA will select the proposal that represents the best value based on the evaluation of technical factors and price, with technical factors being weighed more heavily than price. Therefore, the Offeror's proposal should contain the Offeror's best terms.</p>
<p>This procurement will be conducted as a Two-Phase Deisgn-build process. Phase One will evaluate the technical qualifications and experience of the design and construction teams formed by each potential offeror for this procurement. Phase Two will interview the key Design-Build team members, evaluate the proposed technical solution and Project Management Plan of each design and construction team.</p>
<p>In Phase One, the Government shall identify the evaluation factors other than cost or price that will serve as the basis for the determination of the most highly qualified Offerors. Interested Offerors will be required to submit their responses to the RFQ by the due date established in the RFQ. The Government will evaluate all the responses to the RFQ in accordance with the criteria in the RFQ, and advise each Offeror in writing whether it will be invited to participate in the Phase Two process. Offerors that do not submit a timely RFQ response in Phase One will not be allowed to participate in the remaining phase of the procurement.</p>
<p>In Phase Two, the Government will issue the RFP to the most highly qualified Offerors from Phase One and request that they submit Phase Two proposals. Phase Two of the solicitation shall be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 15 and include Phase Two evaluation factors, developed in accordance with FAR 15.304. Phase Two of the solicitation shall require submission of technical and price proposals, which shall be evaluated separately in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Government will reserve the right to make an award upon the basis of the initial Phase One and Phase Two offers without discussions or negotiations.</p>
<p>GSA IS HEREBY REQUESTING PHASE ONE PROPOSALS. This Phase One Solicitation provides Offerors with instructions regarding the submission of their complete Proposals and the evaluation thereof. Utilizing the format prescribed within, Offerors are to provide the requested information and demonstrate their qualifications. Responses shall be as complete and accurate as possible and present data relative to the specific Project under consideration.

<p><br />F. SUMMARY OF THE PHASE TWO SOLICITATION PROCESS</p>
<p>The following information is provided in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 36.303-1(a)(3). DO NOT SUBMIT A RESPONSE TO PHASE TWO EVALUATION FACTORS AT THIS TIME. Only firms selected during the Phase One evaluation process will be requested to submit a response to Phase Two.<br />The most highly qualified Offerors selected in Phase One will be provided the opportunity to submit competitive technical and price Proposals as detailed in the Phase Two Solicitation. Phase Two will require an acknowledgment by each Offeror that the selected Offeror will comply with all the mandatory performance criteria, technical specifications, and space program requirements within a pre-established maximum cost for the complete Project. Phase Two shall be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 15 (Contracting by Negotiation); one Contract will be awarded using competitive negotiation.</p>
<p>The Evaluation Factors to be used in Phase Two are listed below in descending order of importance. While price is an important consideration, all non-price evaluation factors when combined are significantly more important than price. However, as proposals become more equal in their technical merit (as determined by the evaluation of the non-price evaluation factors set forth below), the evaluated price becomes more important and may become the determining factor for award. The non-price evaluation factors are set out below in descending order of importance.</p>
<p>Phase Two Evaluation Factors:</p>
<p>&bull; Proposed Technical Solutions <br />&bull; Project Management Plan</p>
<p>All submittals must clearly indicate the solicitation number GS-08P-09-JA-C-0089. Late submittals will be handled in accordance with FAR 52.215-1(c)(3). Facsimile proposals will not be accepted.

The General Services Administration intends to award a firm-fixed price contract based on the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Two-Phase Selection Procedures, FAR Subpart 36.3, Source Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3 in conjunction with the "Best Value" process. For this contract award process, GSA will issue two Solicitations in sequence: 1) Phase One, and 2) Phase Two. The Phase One procedure, which is this Request for Qualifications (RFQ), is designed to select a "short list" of the most highly qualified Offerors who will be requested to submit Phase Two proposals. All responsible sources may submit a Phase One Proposal. The number of proposals in the competitive range has been limited to a maximum of five (5), to permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. The most highly rated Offerors will be selected to participate in Phase Two (analogous to Request for Proposals (RFP)).</p>
<p>Interested Offerors are required to submit their responses to this RFQ by the due date established in this RFQ. The Government will evaluate all the responses to this RFQ in accordance with the criteria indentified herein, specifically the technical qualifications, experience and the past performance of the construction management teams formed by each potential offeror for this procurement, and advise each Offeror in writing whether it will be invited to participate in the Phase Two process. Offerors that do not submit a timely RFQ response in Phase One will not be allowed to participate in the remaining phase of the procurement.</p>
<p>In Phase Two, the Government will issue the RFP to the most highly qualified Offerors from Phase One and request that they submit Phase Two proposals. Phase Two of the solicitation shall be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 15 and include phase-two evaluation factors, developed in accordance with FAR 15.304. Phase Two of the solicitation shall require submission of technical and price proposals, which shall be evaluated separately in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Government will reserve the right to make an award upon the basis of the initial Phase One and Phase Two offers without discussions.</p>

<p>2.7 Qualifications Submittal Sealing</p>
<p>The Qualifications submittal is to be placed in a single sealed enclosure and identified with the Offeror's Name, Project Name, Phase One, RFQ Submittal, Solicitation Number GS-08P-10-JA-C-0002, and the Government's time and date delivery requirement.</p>
<p>2.8 Phase One Submission</p>
<p>Firms having the capabilities to perform the services described herein are invited to respond by submitting the required technical information as specified herein. Offerors are required to submit five (5) bound copies of the Offeror's Phase One Qualifications.</p>
<p>Submittals shall be tabbed and labeled in a manner to afford easy identification from a Table of Contents. Each page shall be identified with the appropriate page number centered at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>Font size shall be not less than 10 point.</p>
<p>Sheet size of the submittal shall be 8 1/2 x 11 inches. Tabloid sheets (11 x 17 inches) will be allowed for charts and tables but will be counted as 4 single-sided pages or 2 double-sided pages. Legibility, clarity, coherence, and the contents are important. The Phase One Qualifications document length shall be limited to 50 single-sided or 25 double-sided pages, exclusive of the cover sheet, dividers and table of contents. Questionnaires are received separately and also not counted as part of the 50 page limitation. Offers that do not meet these requirements may be subject to rejection.</p>
<p>A cover sheet identifying the Offeror and the project shall be provided. The second sheet shall be a Table of Contents.</p>
<p>The Qualifications submittal shall contain a detailed Table of Contents and shall be included in each binder used.</p>
<p>Materials submitted but not required by this solicitation (such as company brochures and equipment lists) shall be relegated to appendices.<br /><br />Technical Submissions Requirements:</p>
<p>The Technical submittal shall include information as described previously and shall be presented in the sequence as requested above. Technical submissions shall be organized to correspond with the evaluation factors listed herein.</p>
<p>A project is considered similar when, based on the consensus judgment of the evaluating board members, the project has enough characteristics or similarities in common with the subject project that they could be determined comparable in size, scope and complexity.</p>
<p>For each project, the Offeror shall be evaluated based upon performance as stated in the Past Performance Questionnaire - see Part III of this document. Past performance information will be provided directly from references selected by the contractor. Each contractor is responsible for providing questionnaires (provided in Part III of this RFQ) to their references to complete in a timely manner to allow a completed questionnaire to reach this office by the time and date specified for receipt of information identified in the solicitation.</p>
<p>Offerors are to fill out most of the information on the first page of the questionnaire before sending it to the owner's representative for completion. Failure to obtain the required questionnaires shall result in lowered technical scores for this evaluation factor. Note that GSA will not limit reference contacts to those provided by the Offerors; instead GSA may choose to contact references independent of those provided. It is the Offerors responsibility to contact, request and track the receipt of questionnaires. Offerors shall not collect completed questionnaires, instead they shall be sent directly to the Contract Specialist (see Section 2.6 for the address) by the owner representatives. Questionnaires received after the due date for Phase 1 submissions will not be considered.</p>

<CONTACT>Darrell Parks, Sr. Project Manager, Phone 423/751-4666, Fax 423/751-4619, Email dlparks@tva.gov - Stacci P Thomas, Project Manager, Phone 423/751-8192, Fax 423/751-4619, Email spthomas@tva.gov
<DESC>QUALIFICATION CERTIFICATION FOR CONSTRUCTION OF THE JOHN SEVIER COMBINED CYCLE PROJECT

This communication is a reissue of the original Qualification Certification dated September 16, 2009.  The minimum number of Combined Cycle units is changed from five to three.  If the Qualification Certification dated September 16 was previously executed, it is not necessary to re-submit this document. 

In the near future, TVA will be issuing a solicitation document to request proposals from experienced firms for the construction and startup of the John Sevier Combined Cycle (JCC) project on a fixed price basis.  

The engineering and procurement of major equipment will be performed by URS, Washington Group International.  Currently, TVA has a contract with Washington Group International, Inc., for the construction and startup as well; however TVA is evaluating options for this work to meet TVA’s needs.  TVA does not commit to award a contract under this solicitation or to pay any costs incurred in the development and submission of any subsequent proposal.
. 
The scope of work will be defined for the John Sevier Combined Cycle Project, and will be provided in the Request for Proposals (RFP) to all those prospective offerors that certify they meet the Mandatory Minimum Qualifications.

The John Sevier CC project consists of a 3X1 CC (duct fired) plant located near Rogersville, TN.  The CT’s will be capable of both natural gas and fuel oil operation, and each CT will have an exhaust  bypass stack and diverter damper  included to allow for both simple cycle and combined cycle operation. The water supply will be from the local river, and this project will include installation of pumps at the river, piping to the plant, clarifiers, and other water treatment equipment. TVA will provide three GE frame 7FA.04 dual fuel CT’s, three Nooter-Eriksen HRSG’s (triple pressure with duct firing on natural gas), one 400 MW Toshiba steam turbine (TVA purchased on the gray market), and four ABB generator step up transformers.  WGI will be responsible for the engineering and design for the project, and procurement of the other equipment, including:  condenser, cooling tower, boiler feed pumps, circ water pumps. DCS control system, high energy piping, electrical switchgear, generator breakers, etc.   The requirement of this project is to have the plant operating and in-service in simple cycle mode (both gas and oil fuels) by no later than 12/1/11. Meeting this simple cycle CT in-service date is extremely important to TVA due to transmission system reliability issues. The requirement for combined cycle operational in-service date is not later than 5/1/12.  TVA plans to have a natural gas supply to the facility no later than 9/1/11. The installation of the natural gas conditioning equipment (heaters, separators, filter, and pressure reducing valves) will be installed by the construction contractor.  Approximately 4 million gallons of fuel oil storage and associated pumps and heaters will require to be installed. The scope of work is to provide for the installation of all the equipment procured by TVA and WGI, and to commission and startup the plant.  TVA will procure and construct all the equipment in the 161KV switchyard (from the high side of the GSU out), the natural gas pipeline and meter station, and a new access road into the plant.

TVA desires to select a firm with a history of successful construction and startup experience with combined cycle generation projects that are similar to the workscope described above and in the enclosure entitled Mandatory Minimum Qualification Certification.  Therefore, in order to receive the RFP, TVA requires that all prospective respondents meet these requirements before being further considered.  All prospective respondents must first certify compliance with the requirements contained on the Mandatory Minimum Qualification Certification. Firms which certify to TVA that they can fully meet all of the mandatory minimum qualification requirements will receive a copy of the RFP and will be invited to attend a mandatory pre-proposal meeting. All offerors will be required to present detailed data (later with their proposals) to substantiate compliance with each of the mandatory minimum qualification requirements.

In order to be considered, I must receive the enclosed Certification signed by an official authorized to bind the organization at the address shown below no later than 12 noon EDT, October 8, 2009.

MANDATORY MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS CERTIFICATION

There are certain mandatory minimum qualifications which offerors must meet in order to be invited to submit proposals and be considered for award of the proposed contract.  Offerors will be required to submit detailed supporting documentation (with their proposals) to substantiate meeting all mandatory minimum qualification requirements. Teaming and subcontracting are acceptable.  However, offerers that provide only construction management and plan to subcontract all the work will not be considered for this project.  The minimum qualification requirements may collectively be satisfied by combining the qualifications of team members and subcontractors committed to perform in the event of award, however, these team members must collectively have worked together as a team in the past and as a team satisfy these minimum qualifications.   Individual qualification criteria, however, must be satisfied by individual entities. The minimum qualifications are as follows:


Offerors must have successfully constructed and started up a minimum of three  Combined Cycle (CC) units of no less  than 500 MW (must be 2X1, 3X1, or 4X1 configurations) capacity with “F” class technology combustion turbines  (GE 7FA’s preferred)  that  have been successfully operational for at least one (1) year.   These  3 CC Projects must also have each met the original (pre-construction start) scheduled in service date and must  have been no more than 3% over the original project budget.   
	
Offeror must have the resources, capability and experience  constructing  and starting up CC projects (of at least the type and magnitude similar to that described above) and be able to demonstrate the ability for project management of complex  CC projects with appropriate proposed structure of the project management team.  
	
Offeror must have the financial capacity (creditworthiness) to guarantee the timely performance, obligations, duties and responsibilities under or related to the contract (including performance and warranty issues), for the term of the contract.
	
Offer must have an established, overall, formalized Total Quality Program (TQP). This TQP must include a detailed SA335, GR.P.91 inspection and installation program.
	
Offeror must have the demonstrated capability to manage the commissioning and start-up of CC units.  Must be capable of field performance testing of the individual equipment (i.e. CT’s, Steam turbine, HRSG’s, cooling tower, etc.), and the entire CC plant for MW output and efficiency.

<DESC>UNCLAS: Dist A Approved for public release<BR><BR>Market Survey Questionnaire for Bridge - Light Assault Gap Crossing Capability (LAGCC): Type III<BR><BR>GENERAL INFORMATION: The U.S. Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this survey. The U.S. Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C. 1905 to protect information qualifying as confidential under this statute. [To avoid possible confusion with the meaning of the term confidential in the context of Classified Information, we will use the term PROPRIETARY.] Pursuant to this statute, the U.S. Government is willing to accept any trade secret or PROPRIETARY restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following:<BR>1. Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data with the restrictive legend (all caps) PROPRIETARY with any explanatory text, so that the U.S. Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected.<BR>2. In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly confidential (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as PROPRIETARY may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected.<BR>3. The U.S. Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the U.S. Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the U.S. Government will not be protected once in the public domain. Data already in the possession of the U.S. Government will be protected in accordance with the U.S. Government's rights in the data.<BR>4. Confidential data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the U.S. Government, shall contain the PROPRIETARY legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself. Where appropriate for only portions of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends PROPRIETARY PORTION BEGINS: and PROPRIETARY PORTION ENDS.<BR>5. In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the U.S. Government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text.<BR>UNCLAS: Dist A Approved for public release<BR>6. The U.S. Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses that contain confidential information may receive only limited or no consideration since the Respondents marking of data as PROPRIETARY will preclude disclosure of same outside the U.S. Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort. The U.S. Government will use its best efforts to evaluate those responses that contain confidential information without using support contractors consistent with the resources available.<BR>DESCRIPTION OF INTENT:<BR>THIS IS A MARKET SURVEY REQUESTING INFORMATION IN SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENT: No contract will be awarded from this announcement. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation. Also, it is not a request seeking contractors interested in being placed on a solicitation mailing list. Response to this questionnaire is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to the market survey and any follow-on information requests. Data submitted in response to this market survey will not be returned. No solicitation document exists at this time, and calls requesting a solicitation will not be answered.<BR>PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENT:<BR>The purpose of this questionnaire is to obtain information on commercial industry capability to satisfy U.S. Army requirements for a Light Assault Gap Crossing Capability (LAGCC) bridge. The requirement will be achieved in a single step versus an evolutionary series or steps.<BR>1. The Type III LAGCC system must fully support execution of joint critical operational activities (Threshold {T}), and all critical operational activities (Objective {O}), identified in the applicable joint and system integrated architectures. The system must satisfy the technical requirements for transition to Net-Centric (T), or already Net-Centric (O), military operations to include:<BR>a.

Bridge systems must be able to keep pace with the maneuver element to maintain momentum.<BR>UNCLAS: Dist A Approved for public release<BR>10. The Type III LAGCC shall be capable of operating in all types of weather (rain, snow, salt spray, fog, ice, dust, sand, turbulence and high humidity), hot and basic climatic zones (-25F to 125F), and wind speeds up to 50 knots without special kits while maintaining full mission capability (T). Shall have cold weather kits allowing operation down to -50F (O).<BR>11. The Type III LAGCC shall be capable of fording at a normal depth of 48 inches without an affixed deep water fording kit. All external optics and electronic components shall be watertight / proof to preclude damage during shallow water fording operations (T).<BR>12. Type III LAGCC Launch/Retrieve Requirements:<BR>Threshold (T):<BR>The operators of the host vehicle (not to exceed a crew of 2 soldiers), shall launch/retrieve the bridge in 10 minutes or less during daylight hours, 15 minutes or less during all conditions of visibility and 15 minutes while wearing Individual Protective Equipment (IPE). The LAGCC must be launchable/retrievable from both ends of the bridge.<BR>Objective (O):<BR>The operators of the host vehicle (not to exceed a crew of 2 soldiers) shall launch/retrieve the bridge in 5 minutes or less during daylight hours, 10 minutes or less during all conditions of visibility and 10 minutes while wearing IPE.<BR>13. The Type III LAGCC shall have a means of determining remaining service life and safety/structural deficiencies, which does not require an external power source. The conditions and use of the bridge can vary greatly and it is essential to have a method for determining safety and service life of the bridge.<BR>14. The Type III LAGCC shall have an average transport reconfiguration time of 2 hours or less using equipment operators and onboard tools (T) or loaded and removed in operable configuration and immediately available for towing/operation by its designated prime mover (O) after C-130 transport.<BR>15. The Type III LAGCC launch/retrieval mechanisms shall have a power source that utilizes standard military fuels (JP8) and standard lubricants (if required) or be capable of utilizing the power source (i.e. electrical, air, hydraulic) of the host vehicle (T), slave receptacle of any military vehicle for power (O).<BR>16. The Type III LAGCC launcher/retriever shall provide a back-up capability that will allow the Type III LAGCC platform to be launched and retrieved (T), in 30 minutes (O). The Type II LAGCC will be the sole tactical gap crossing capability within the IBCT.<BR>UNCLAS: Dist A Approved for public release<BR>17. The power source for the Type III LAGCC must possess a NATO slave receptacle. The NATO slave receptacle is standard auxiliary equipment on military equipment and allows interoperability with any vehicle for emergency starts.<BR>18. The Type III LAGCC, when mounted onto or towed by the host vehicle, shall be capable of sustained hard surface speeds of 40 mph (T), 50 mph (O).<BR>19. The Type III LAGCC shall have a roadway width which provides adequate traction when wet or dry for all vehicles organic to the IBCT, (see paragraph 6), traveling at a normal crossing speed of up to a maximum 15 mph (T), 25 mph (O).<BR>20. The Type III LAGCC shall be equipped with lifting and tie-down provisions for transportation in accordance with (IAW) Military Standard (MIL-STD) 209. Military standard lifting and tie-down provisions are necessary for safe and efficient deployment in all modes of transportation.<BR>21. The Type III bridge structural components shall withstand 17,600 MLC 30 vehicle crossings (T), 20,000 MLC 50 crossings (O), without experiencing a durability failure. The launch/retrieve mechanism and bridge structural components shall withstand 800 launch and retrieve cycles (T), 1,000 launch and retrieve cycles (O), without experiencing a durability failure. The Type III LAGCC durability requirements are based upon a 10-year life, which was comprised of 8 years of peacetime and two 180 day wartime periods. It is estimated that a small number of caution crossings will be conducted during the 180-day wartime periods amounting to approximately 150 vehicle crossings at the allowable cautionary MLC.<BR>22. The Type III LAGCC shall have a manual bridge travel lock to lock the bridge into the stowed position while traveling (T). The Type III LAGCC shall have an automated bridge travel lock to lock the bridge into the stowed position while traveling and must alert the operator and commander that the bridge travel lock is in position (O). This requirement is necessary in order to ensure safe operation of the vehicle in travel mode and to prevent damage to the bridge or system. The automated bridge travel lock would ensure the operators are not exposed to enemy fire while emplacing or recovering the bridge.<BR>23. If wheeled, the Type III LAGCC shall be able to change tire pressure from inside the cab of the vehicle. The vehicle operator of the Type III LAGCC must be able to adjust the tire pressure of the vehicle to ensure maximum mobility through a multitude of terrain types without exposure to enemy fire.<BR>24. The Type III LAGCC shall be capable of achieving 350 miles without refueling at an avg speed of 40 mph on level paved roads (T); 400 miles without refueling at an avg speed of 45 mph is objective (O). The Type III shall be capable of ferrying maximum load (40 tons) in currents of 1.82 mps (6 fps) without refueling for 6 hours (T); maximum load (50 tons) in currents of 3.04 mps (10 fps) without refueling for 8 hours is objective (O). Maneuver elements must be<BR>UNCLAS: Dist A Approved for public release<BR>capable of keeping momentum and pushing an advantage without stopping for a single vehicle to refuel.<BR>25.

<DESC><p>Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC), for Design/Build or Construction type task orders. Task orders issued under this MATOC can require performance of work anywhere within the South Atlantic Division Area of Operations (North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, and Mississippi). Projects will typically be located on military installations within these boundaries.

The pool size (number of contracts that may be awarded) shall not exceed six (6) contractors. The pool of contractors which successfully receive an award will share the total contract capacity of $499M. The government will use a two-phase design build evaluation process. The order limitation of task orders, to include the seed task order that will be used for evaluation purposes and award of the initial contracts, shall range between $1M and $40M.

All other successful offerors, if any, will be awarded a contract with a minimum guarantee of $2,500. The evaluation factors and their relative importance for both Phase I and Phase II of this solicitation and evaluation process are as follows: <br /><br />Phase I: Factor 1-1 CORPORATE RELEVANT SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE, Factor 1-2 PAST PERFORMANCE, and Factor 1-3 TECHNICAL APPROACH NARRATIVE. Factor 1-1 is more important than factors 1-2 and 1-3. Factor 1-2: is equal in importance to Factor 1-3.

The supplies and services required to meet the agency’s needs are:  The contractor must offer a variety of equipment, classes and family activities.  Equipment must include cardiovascular and strength exercise machines.  Classes include aerobics, cycling, swimming, Pilates and yoga.  Family activities include camps, sports leagues, and character development.  Wellness classes are conducted by Certified YMCA personnel.

This broad selection of athletic equipment and programs is required to meet the needs of DFAS employees who are a diverse group of civilian personnel varying widely in their interests, age and overall fitness levels.

The athletic facility must be located within walking distance to minimize the time spent traveling to and from the facility.  Civilian personnel have restricted lunch periods of an hour or less and require a facility with minimal commute to accommodate this constraint.  Although a variety of other exercise facilities exist within the Indianapolis area, none are located in a proximity that makes their use by DFAS employees practical.  The YMCA has a substantial number of membership facilities throughout the United States that civilian personnel can use free of charge while on Temporary Duty.  The YMCA offers memberships on a monthly basis.   

The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 C (1), FAR 6.302-1.    

The reason for the authority cited:  The Contractor, Benjamin Harrison YMCA, is located within walking distance of the DFAS center and can provide weight room, lap pool, aerobic classes, gymnasium, shower facilities family activities, and health and wellness classes and family activities.

An effort to Obtain Competition:  A market analysis was conducted to determine which athletic facilities would meet DFAS requirements for location, equipment, classes and family activities.

Fair and Reasonable Cost Determination: Cost of the YMCA membership is determined to be fair and reasonable.  The membership costs were evaluated by a market analysis.

A market analysis was conducted to determine which athletic facilities would meet DFAS requirements for location, equipment, accessibility and classes.  The market analysis indicated that of the three facilities surveyed in addition to the Benjamin Harrison YMCA, Lifetime Fitness, LA Fitness and Gold’s Gym.  LA Fitness and Lifetime Fitness offered comparable programs.  However, Lifetime has only one facility which located approximately seven miles from DFAS and in a busy retail area not easily accessible.  LA Fitness has several facilities in the area the closest being 6 miles from DFAS.  LA Fitness does not offer youth leagues and does not honor all memberships at all of their facilities. 

Interested Sources:  To date, no other sources have expressed an interest in writing.

    The Greater Indianapolis and Fort Harrison YMCA continue to be the only facility to meet the DFAS requirement. 

JUSTIFICATION FOR MEMBERSHIPS:

Directors may use contracts for organizational memberships in and use of local commercial or municipal fitness facilities when onsite facilities are not available or adequate.  The civilians assigned to DFAS Indianapolis do not have the support of a military facility to conduct their required physical fitness training.

DFAS Indianapolis has established a Quality of Work Life Program which is a multi-dimensional program encompassing all elements of the employee environment including family, community, special emphasis, employee assistance programs, health and safety, physical fitness, and lifestyle management.

DFAS employees often travel for official business and do not have access to fitness facilities.  The YMCA has locations throughout the U.S. where members can use their facilities by using their local membership cards.  

Scientific studies indicate that individuals who maintain their participation in wellness programs increase self-efficacy, developing appropriate coping responses and extended periods in fitness activities.  These views point out the potential importance of regular physical activity at moderate intensity, toward the psychological health of the individual.  Public health goals acknowledge the need for intervention strategies that can improve the physical activities of employees.

<DESC>Recovery Action. This is notice of the Department of Energy, Golden Field Office award of a 61 time and material non-competitive purchase orders to various merit reviewers under various Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) during the month of September 2009. The total value of these awards was $593,215.44. These awards were made under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures and typically were awarded to small businesses. These purchases were accomplished under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 541690. The places of performance are typically at the merit reviewer's location and various conference meeting facilities. The periods of performance are typically one to four months from the date of award.
<p>These requirements are for non-personal commercial services and travel expenses for the merit reviewers. Merit reviewer services are required by the Department of Energy to review proposals submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcements for various Alternative Energy Resource Technology Programs. Merit reviewers also are required to participate in technical merit review meetings to discuss and document results of each individual proposal reviewed and to reach consensus for individual Financial Assistance awards.</p>
<p>Rational for using other than a competitive approach: Merit reviewer services can only be provided from individuals with specialized expert professional experience in the Alternative Energy Resource Program Technology areas of Solar, Geothermal, Biomass, Hydrogen, Wind, Hydro and Industrial Technologies. The available experts who can provide the required merit review technical services is very limited based on the unique qualifications and specific expertise of the Alternative Energy Resource Technology areas. The merit review services ultimately lead to the selection of entities to receive Financial Assistance awards which will create new and innovative approaches pertaining to our countries energy needs. Award to any other sources other than the individuals with specialized expert professional experience in the Alternative Energy Resource Program Technology areas would result in inadequate reviews and recommendations. Additionally, services are required immediately to support the Department of Energy mission.</p>
<p>Rational for using other than a Firm Fixed approach:<br />Time &amp; Material (T&amp;M) purchase orders were utilized because the uncertainties involved could not be identified and quantified with reasonable estimates. A very large volume of financial assistance proposals were expected to be received in conjunction with several new solicitations this year and therefore it was impossible to estimate how many would actually be submitted. A larger number of financial assistance proposals were received by the Department of Energy this year, many more than in any year prior. The proposals were also much more involved. As a result, there was no way to accurately estimate with any accuracy how many hours would be required to complete the individual merit reviews. Therefore, sufficient factual information did not exist at the time of award to permit the use of a Firm Fixed Price contract. No other contract type authorized by FAR 16.000 was suitable. These contractual actions are justified IAW FAR 16.601 Time and Material Contracts.</p>

<DESC>The requirement is for the purchase of EMC storage to maintain the existing Enterprise storage infrastructure and to provide consistent support of this Enterprise Storage environment.  Specifically this procurement will support not only the Offices of Economic Analysis, Enforcement, and Information Technology, but Enterprise applications and numerous other small systems effecting the SEC agency wide.  

The SEC has already approved and purchased multiple EMC storage systems which are in production.  The SEC is in the process of deploying additional storage support systems that use EMC equipment as back-end storage.  Specifically, EMC is the architecture that is currently supporting SEC production systems and the new procurement is to add equipment within this architecture.  EMC storage products are critical to the project and production support.  EMC is the manufacturer of the current system and for maintenance and compatibility with the existing system EMC is the only known brand that meets this requirement.  

Several vendors can provide storage, but this storage is not compatible with the existing architecture and only EMC professional service personnel can provide the installation and advanced technical support for the EMC product.  Therefore, due to licensing, warranty, and infrastructure compatibility requirements it would not be possible for another vendor to provide compatible services and similar hardware capable of meeting the SEC’s storage requirements.  However, based on market research this storage equipment is available through numerous EMC resellers.  

Although there are several vendors that can provide storage, their storage is not compatible with the existing architecture and only EMC professional service personnel can provide the installation and advanced technical support for the EMC product.  If other than EMC storage systems are purchased the system may not function properly, if at all, and EMC will not support or maintain the system.  Failure of the system would inhibit the mission of the Office of Economic Analysis in their market research, Enforcement will not have the ability to process data for litigation, and systems supporting Enterprise applications will run out of storage space.

<DESC>The requirement is for the purchase of EMC MDS blades to expand the existing enterprise SAN switch infrastructure and to provide consistent support of the SEC’s Enterprise Storage environment.  Specifically this procurement is being used to support the Office of Economic Analysis in their market research project supporting the SEC.  

The SEC has already approved and purchased multiple EMC MDS SAN storage switches which are in production.  The SEC is in the process of deploying additional storage support systems that use shared SAN as back-end storage.  Specifically, EMC MDS is the architecture that is currently supporting SEC production systems and the new procurement is to add equipment within this architecture. EMC MDS storage products are critical to the project and production support. 

Several vendors can provide SAN switches, but these switches are not compatible with the existing architecture. Therefore, due to licensing, warranty, proprietary data and infrastructure compatibility requirements it would not be possible for another vendor to provide compatible services and similar hardware capable of meeting the SEC’s requirements.
   
Cisco is the original equipment manufacture (OEM) of the current system, but all firmware and support for the MDS are provided by EMC. For maintenance and compatibility with the existing system EMC is the only known brand that meets this requirement.  

There is no known hardware manufactured by any other vendor, other than Cisco, that will work in the EMC/Cisco MDS chassis. The EMC/Cisco MDS blades that have been requested are propriety in nature. If other than EMC/Cisco blades are purchased the system may not function properly, if at all, and EMC will not support or maintain the system. 
If this requirement is prohibited from being processed as stated herein, failure of the system would inhibit the mission of the Office of Economic Analysis in their market research project in support of research efforts of the SEC.

<DESC>This requirement is to upgrade and replace the existing old Linux servers and Windows file servers agency wide with new HP servers as part of a rolling replacement.  

Large IT systems are built and certified by vendors as a functional design, and each system is unique.  Once a discrete system is built based on a specific configuration, any changes to the core elements have to be planned carefully to make sure they are compatible with that configuration.  Since the servers are part of a larger Enterprise system, the hardware and software compatibility is essential.  The SEC production network is using HP-based servers for its critical business applications such as email spam filtering, Outlook, and Momentum.  
 
Due to licensing, warranty, and compatibility issues it would not be possible for another vendor to provide compatible servers capable of meeting the SEC’s requirements.  Only the HP servers specified can be used to be fully compatible with the current configuration.  However, HP has authorized resellers that this requirement could be competed amongst.

Although there are several vendors that can provide servers, their hardware and software is not compatible with the existing architecture.  If other than HP servers are purchased the system may not function properly, if at all, and would endanger the availability of SEC Mission critical applications such as Outlook, Momentum, the SEC.GOV public website, SharePoint applications, litigation efforts, and the user problem reporting system, ITSM.

As such, a cost reimbursement type action was awarded.  Furthermore :)  This work is part of the existing specifications and a detailed scope of work can not be prepared.  The extent of the work and the resources needed cannot be fully determined due to the growth patterns of this invasive grass species. This contract enables work to begin immediately after and even during the inspections without a detailed scope of work so as to minimize the growth and spreading of this grass species. Modification P00008 is funded by American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funds and all clauses apply.<BR><BR>

<DESC>RECOVERYPER FAR 5.7 THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY; THEREFORE FAR 5.203 DOES NOT APPLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER:  ANDERSON CONSTRUCTION CO. OF FORT GAINES GEORGIA DACW01-03-C-0017.  Provide operation and maintenance of Government owned Facilities and Equipment at Walter F. George Lake, ACF Rivers Lake, Fort Gaines, Georgia.<BR>Using Recovery Act Funding, the Mobile District Corps of Engineers intends to issue a modification to contract number DACW01-03-C-0017, a competitively awarded Cost-Reimbursable Plus Award-Fee (CPAF) contract for the Operation and Maintenance of Government-Owned Facilities and Equipment, Walter F George Lake, ACF Rivers Project, Fort Gaines Georgia, awarded to Anderson Construction Company, 58 Crozier Lane, Fort Gaines, Georgia.  Utilizing American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds, after several years of reduced operating budgets, this contract was reduced in scope causing numerous employee layoffs and reduced service levels.  This modification will return the contract value to its original award amount and allow the contractor to hire additional staff to return the contract to its full service level.  This work is within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and includes maintaining and repairing buildings, structures, facilities, and their mechanical, electrical, plumbing, sewage and water systems.  Contract clauses required for projects involving Recovery Act funds have been incorporated into the existing contract. <BR><BR>The existing contract must be used for the following reasons: 1)  This ARRA package was specifically written and approved for this purpose.  2) The contractor is responsible for the complete inspection, maintenance, and repair of all project buildings and structures in 17 recreation areas, three operations areas, and the Project Management Office. 3) The scheduling, coordination, quality assurance and/or subcontracting for the work to be performed are within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and must be accomplished under the terms of the existing contract. The incumbent contractor not only has the management, technical, and administrative skills to efficiently and effectively accomplish this work at a reasonable cost, but also the advantage of the flexibility to readily adjust to any unforeseen obstacles encountered during installation. 4) This contract enables repairs to begin immediately after and during inspections without a detailed scope of work and thus minimizes the time the facilities are closed and the impact on public access to camping and recreation during the busiest season of the year. <BR><BR>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using funds appropriated by the Act. Acquisitions must comply with FAR, and to the maximum extent practicable, be awarded under competitive procedures as fixed-price (FP) contracts. The Mobile District intends to use the current CPAF contract to meet its  requirements. Though not a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside. The contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. Furthermore, the existing Operation and Maintenance contractor has experienced personnel that are already on site and ready to perform the work. Accordingly, it is deemed to be in the best interest of the government and in compliance with the goals of the Recovery Act to use the existing Operation and Maintenance contract to accomplish the requirements listed above. <BR>Contracting Office Address: <BR>US Army Engineer District, Mobile, P.

The proposed contractor is the only company that can fulfill the requirements set forth by the VA San Diego Healthcare System. VASDHS currently utilizes Philips Medical monitoring system. A significant benefit to patient care shall be realized due to compatibility and commonality of operating systems and patient connections.

Departments are centrally connected via a Philips proprietary Data Base Server(s) via a Philips proprietary network connecting the ED, DOU, PACU, and ICU which all have Philips monitoring systems. This common centralized Philips connection allows for the transfer of patient data, 96hour full disclosure, ADT functionality (Admit, Discharge, & Transfer), and overview of any patient on the network from any other location on the network , and full communication between all these departments and systems. The upgraded Telemetry system is utilized on three wards throughout the medical center but is required to communicate with the departments using existing Philips monitoring equipment via the Data Base Server(s).All components of the Philips network, existing and proposed upgraded, require the use of Philips proprietary software and customized firmware. Seamless, secure, reliable and facile transfer of patient physiological data between geographically remote parts of the medical center is essential to providing outstanding patient care.  6.

Contracting Organization:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 20,  VA American Lake, Tacoma,  Medical Center.2.	Description of Action: This is a request for other than full and open competition for the procurement of repair service from Bens Precision Instruments.3.

Validity of Use of Statutory Authority:  While initial repair work was being done, much greater extensiveness of work required was realized and additional repairs were needed.

Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price:  The anticipated price to the Government is $ 4,500.  The Contracting Officer determines that the price was fair and reasonable for this procurement.  Similar work done on pod. #663-P96508 in the amount of $4900.00.   8.	Market Survey (FAR 10):  None - Job was underway, equipment was in urgent need of execution.9.
