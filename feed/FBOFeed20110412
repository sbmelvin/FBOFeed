<DESC>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), Division of Laboratory Science, intends to award a sole source contract to Spark Holland, Inc/Ichrom Solutions, 186 Mantoloking Road, Suite #7, Brick, NJ 08723-5888 for the Maintenance of the Spark Holland Instruments. <br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing. The period of performance for this procurement is a&nbsp;8 month base period and four 12 month options. <br />The purpose of this procurement is for Spark Holland to provide annual preventative maintenance service as well as emergency on-site support in the event the instruments fail to work properly. The&nbsp;Symbiosis Solid Phase Extraction (SPE)&nbsp;unit require extensive programming capable of automatically exchanging the SPE cartridges in a way that is completely synchronized with the operation of the system pump and mass spectrometer data collection.&nbsp; <br />Spark Holland is the only responsible source capable of meeting all of the Government's requirement because they are the original equipment manufacture of the instruments and they are the only company capable of maintaining the systems.&nbsp; The Spark Holland trained engineers periodically receive service information and updates often consisting of compilation of recent problems and suggested methods of correction. These service information reports are only distributed to the personnel trained and actively employed by Spark Holland. The exchange of cartridges is needed to ensure validity of the analytical results because of the complexity of the serum matrix.&nbsp; The equipment provides an on-line solid phase extraction.&nbsp; <br />As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to the Spark Holland. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications to provide the services to Richard Jenkins via email ONLY at <a href="mailto:RJenkins@cdc.gov">RJenkins@cdc.gov</a> with the solicitation number 2011-N-13394 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN April 27, 2011. <br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), Division of Laboratory Sciences, intends to award a sole source contract to Trinity Biotech USA, Inc., 2823 Girts Road, Jamestown, NY 14701 for the acquisition of a High Performance Liquid Chromatography GeneSYS Newborn Screening Analyzer. <br /><br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 325412, Pharmaceutical Preparation Manufacturing. The period of performance for this procurement is 5 months. <br /><br />The Trinity Biotech High Performance Liquid Chromatography GeneSys Newborn Screening Analyzer can provide both a screening run and a confirmatory run as well as identify thalassemisa in addition to hemoglobin variants. This instrument will also allow CDC continuity of the current methods run in our laboratory and it will fulfill all of our requirements by performing all of the following functions.<br />&nbsp;
<p>&bull; The hemoglobin fractionation system employs the principles of ion-exchange chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography.<br />&bull; The system utilizes a Windows XP<sup>TM</sup> based program especially designed for hemoglobin variant analysis of neonatal samples.<br />&bull; The software is able to be changed/customized at any time to accommodate laboratory needs.<br />&bull; The system incorporates a 2 minute Quick Scan program and an 8 minute High Resolution program with the ability to automatically reflex from Quick Scan program to High Resolution program for unattended screening and confirmation of hemoglobin variants in neonatal and adult (samples not considered neonatal) samples.<br />&bull; System is able to perform screening-2minute and confirmation-8 minute testing utilizing the same reagents and columns.<br />&bull; Reagents and columns are not lot dependant. User will be able to use any combination of lot reagents with any lot columns.<br />&bull; The system uses a FASC reference material<br />&bull; The system uses a relative retention time approach in the presumptive identification of variant hemoglobin.<br />&bull; The system offers automated hemolysate preparation for dried blood spots in a microtiter plate and direct sampling of microtiter plates. The automated sample preparation is an integrated step in the sampling program selected by user.<br />&bull; The system produces reports with the sample identification information, date and time, followed by the chromatogram with retention times indicated at the apex of each peak. A peak summary report can be printed after the chromatogram with the retention time, relative retention time, % area, phenotype and comments for each peak in the chromatogram. A batch summary report can be generated at the end of every run.<br />&bull; System is able to label Hbs; A, S, C, D, E, O and Bart's with presumptive IDs in the High Resolution mode. The phenotype for each sample is labeled based on the highest to lowest concentration of Hb.<br />&bull; Reports and results are able to be printed to a pdf file on the system or printed on 8" x 11" paper.</p>
<p><br />This instrument is essential to the laboratory work of the Newborn Screening Molecular Biology Branch. As such, it is in continuous use and must be maintained appropriately to ensure accuracy and quality results. This is also the only vendor that can run both a 2 mintue Quick Scan program and an 8 minute High Resolution program using the same reagents and consumables. Furthermore, this is the only instrument that can automatically reflex from the Quick Scan to the High Resolution program for unattended screening and confirmation of hemoglobin variants. This is also the only instrument that is capable of identifying the of hemoglobinopathies A, S, C, D, E, O and Bart's with presumptive IDs in the High Resolution mode. The phenotype for each sample shall be labeled based on the highest to lowest concentration of Hb. This is also the only instrument that will allow our laboratory the flexibility to change and customize the software to accommodate other laboratory needs without purchasing a new instrument.</p>
<p>Only Trinity Biotech and Bio-Rad Clinical Diagnostics have HPLC instruments and software specific for newborn screening specimens in the dried-blood spot matrix. We currently have a Bio-Rad instrument but it is less flexible, cannot confirm hemoglobin variants in a longer sampling time, and cannot identify thalassemia automatically. Other kits and columns would be required and it would be inefficient to switch between methods with one instrument.</p>
<p>As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to Trinity Biotech. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide the services to Vallerie Redd via email ONLY at gfj3@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 94994 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN April 27, 2011. <br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>Announcement:
In accordance with Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (AMS) Policy 3.2.1.2.1 - this announcement is to conduct a Market Survey for the purpose of soliciting statements of interest and capabilities from interested vendors.  This announcement is NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR) or REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).  Further, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.
At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.  The Principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 334511, Air traffic control radar systems and equipment manufacturing with a size standard of 750 employees. 
All responses (one per company) are to be provided on company letterhead and limited to a total of 20 typewritten pages.  No type font less than 11 point may be used.  
  Background:
The TDWR was developed in the late 1980's and early 1990's as the primary ground-based wind shear protection system for detecting, tracking and advising air traffic controllers of severe weather events that may be hazardous to aircraft flying near major airports, especially during takeoff and landing.   The FAA installed and operates 45 TDWRs serving 46 airports that were selected on the basis of aircraft traffic density and probability of severe weather conditions.  In addition, there are two support systems located in Oklahoma for a total of 47 TDWR systems.   The function of the TDWR radome is to protect the radar antenna and the antenna pedestal from wind and weather.  It also protects personnel while working on the antenna, pedestal and related equipment.  TDWR radomes are maintained by the FAA Logistics Center (FAALC) in Oklahoma City, OK.
The TDWR Radome Replacement project is part of the FAA's program to extend the system's service life beyond 2020.  The original radomes are at the end of their service life.  The objective of the radome replacement project is to replace the radomes at 43 TDWR sites and to provide one depot spare.  The first delivery would be made six months after contract award and installations would continue at the rate of two per month until all are complete.
PURPOSE:
This market survey is to provide information for the FAA to consider in choosing the method and type of procurement competition.  The failure to obtain adequate and appropriate SBA 8(a) or other small business participation may result in a determination to conduct this procurement under other competitive procedures.
The FAA requires copies of certification letters for interested service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.  
In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following information from interested vendors:

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD) intends to negotiate a non-competitive award with the University of California at San Diego, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, for services in support of specialized testing to better understand and identify technical issues related to, ocean environmental sensing and ship motion forecasting.
Two key objectives of our support for this program include 1) Understanding and interpreting the data provided by ocean environmental sensors in a manner that will enable them to be used as timely input for ship control systems, and 2) Describing the interaction of the ships hull; propulsion; and maneuvering and positioning control systems with the near-field ocean environment, and developing methods capable of predicting the ships six-degree-of-freedom response.
  Data from the wave buoy analysis performed in 2010 will also be used.  The University of California at San Diego, Scripps Institution of Oceanography is the only known organization with the expertise and experience operating the WAMOS radar system on shore and aboard ship.  They also possess the WAMOS wave data collected on the same exact near-shore and open-ocean environment as the Navy instrumentation radar.

<DESC>The RRRP replaces instrumentation radar systems at four Army test ranges:  White Sands Test Center, Yuma Test Center, Redstone Test Center, and Aberdeen Test Center.  The acquisition of modern instrumentation radar systems provides the test centers with improved radar resolution, sensitivity, accuracy, clutter suppression and reliability.  The system consists of a radar sensor deployed in the field and Radar Operations Console (ROC) deployed in a range control facility. The ROC allows remote control of the radar over the network and reduces operational costs by reducing the crew size from four personnel per radar in the field to one person at the ROC.  The mobility of the radar sensor decreases relocation time from two weeks to two days, increasing the operational tempo of the radar fleet and mission throughput.  Mobility of the radars allows optimum radar placement for improved test data for the wide variety of test scenarios supported by each test center.<br><br>A competitive source selection under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15 as a best value utilizing the trade-off process will be used to determine the best value to the Government.  The procurement awards one Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) (in accordance with FAR 16.5) contract with a period of performance of 10 years to a prime contractor.  The contract spans the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) and Production phases of the acquisition life cycle through field test and deployment.  The RRRP schedule allows for up to three years of EMD followed by seven years of production.  EMD ends with successful testing of first articles for Fly-Out radar, Close-In radar and the ROC.  The EMD schedule includes three months of first article testing.  The seven year production schedule includes Initial Operational Capability, Final Operational Capability and delivery of all radar systems, spare parts and training.  <br><br>Delivery schedules will be provided under the delivery order(s) issued.   One or more of the items under this acquisition is subject to World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement, Free Trade Agreements, and the Balance of Payments Act.

<DESC>                 THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE FOR CONSULTING SERVICES AS DESCRIBED 
                 BELOW. THE SOLICITATION ISSUE DATE WILL BE APRIL 15, 2011 AND WILL
                CLOSE MAY 16, 2011.

1.	TITLE OF PROJECT

Quality Management Development Contract to validate Philadelphia VA Medical Center's Joint Commission, CARF, Patient Safety, Quality, Consultation, Education and Training Activities. 

2.	PURPOSE OF PROJECT

Although this project is the continuation of the successful work of Joint Commission readiness, it is not just a Joint Commission readiness project. In order to successfully maintain Joint Commission accreditation, an organization cannot just do a last minute ramp up. It is imperative that organizations understand systems and processes. It is equally important to understand and operationalize a quality outcomes management philosophy and structure. This structure should be able to address both the outcomes of organizational processes but also address the individual outcomes of veterans receiving care. In addition, patient safety initiatives must be integrated into all organizational systems. In order to do this, multiple integrated systems must be evaluated and in some cases redesigned. 

Therefore, the purpose of this project is to: analyze and evaluate current Joint Commission (JC) and CARF readiness, continue the evolution of the quality program in order to be one of proactive improvement rather than reactive quality assurance, provide staff development in the areas of systems and process re-design, work with leadership on critical care and other processes, facilitate the development of a comprehensive patient safety program. Emphasis will be placed on system design and compliance, performance improvement, quality outcomes management, tactical and operational planning and staff analysis and development. 

The end result would be the on-going state of readiness for Joint Commission and CARF activities rather than a staff intensive, resource intensive, ramp up at the last minute.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
<p>Upon the basis of the following justification, I, as Contracting Officer, hereby approve the use of other than full and open competition of the proposed contractual action pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION</p>
<p>1. REQUIRING AGENCY AND CONTRACTING OFFICE: <br />United States Africa Command/ C4 Systems <br /><br />Contracting Activity:<br />DITCO-Europe/PL512 <br /><br /><br />2. NATURE/DESCRIPTION OF ACTION(S): United States Africa Command (USAFRICOM)/ Command, Control, Communications and Computers (C4S) Directorate has a requirement to solicit, negotiate, and award a contract or purchase order as a sole source through CODAN US Inc for the purchase of High Frequency (HF) equipment items listed as per the attached. 90 days after receipt of order, the High Frequency radio equipment must be delivered with export licenses, operators must be trained, and the High Frequency radio network must be operational.</p>
<p>CODAN US Inc, the sole US subsidiary of the CODAN Limited group of companies, currently manufactures and supplies High Frequency radio systems to the United States Government (USG) through Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and General Services Administration (GSA). Countries and programs include Afghanistan, Iraq and supply to Central Asia (Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan) through the Department of State. CODAN has also supplied High Frequency radios to many countries throughout Africa. These countries include Algeria, Angola, Botswana, Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia. In addition, CODAN has also provided High Frequency radios to the African Union (AU) for peacekeeping forces and supplied over 150 High Frequency radios in 2006 to the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) to support the AU's peacekeeping mission in Darfur. CODAN provides service and support throughout the world via a network of dealers, distributors and agents. CODAN radio products are used in approximately 40 countries in Africa, as well as international entities in Africa, such as the African Union and the United Nations.</p>
<p>3. DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES: High Frequency radios operate in the 3 to 30 megahertz range of the radio frequency spectrum. The radio transmissions propagate through the atmosphere via line of sight or via the ionosphere, where the maximum theoretical range is 10,000+ kilometers. High Frequency radio is inexpensive, and a well-understood technology that is used extensively by coalition military. It is usually a backup means of communication because of its limited bandwidth and antenna space requirements. However, High Frequency radio is often used as the primary means of communication in disaster relief and humanitarian assistance scenarios, as well as in situations where commercial information technology infrastructure is damaged or unavailable. For this reason, African partner nation personnel employ High Frequency radio more often than any other communications technology. The particular radios that are being considered for this effort are military-grade tactical radios that can securely communicate using both voice and data.</p>
<p>The African Union Command, Control, Communications and Information Systems program aims to enable communication between the African Union and the Regional Economic Centers, which control African Standby Forces. African Standby Forces are employed in a variety of peacekeeping missions on the continent of Africa. High Frequency radio can operate either in line of sight or beyond line of sight, making it the radio of choice vs. VHF or UHF radio which have greater constraints on their effective range. African Partner Nation personnel are familiar with High Frequency radio technology and currently employ it in their day-to-day activities. In addition, High Frequency radio can operate independent of infrastructure, to support communications in austere, disconnected mission locations that do not have available information technology infrastructure such as Internet service providers or satellite communications. If the Codan equipment is not purchased, the African Union headquarters, regional economic centers, and African Standby Forces will not have a means of secure communications. Non-secure means of communication could result in the compromise of the mission and possible loss of life. If a non-interoperable solution is chosen, the existing Harris-based High Frequency radio network supporting a current African Union mission will have to be redesigned or replaced, resulting in a monetary loss of approximately $. <br /><br />The CODAN High Frequency radios employ encryption based on the non-proprietary Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), which uses a 256-bit digital encryption key. The existing Harris radios used in a current African Union mission are also capable of using AES encryption The end-state goal is to enable secure voice and data communications between the African Union Headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, African Union missions and the 5 regional economic centers</p>

<p>This procurement includes equipment contained in Enclosure 2, Equipment List as above. The funding will be Department of Defense.</p>
<p>4. IDENTIFICATION OF STATUTORY AUTHORITY: Pursuant to the authority of 10 USC 2304c(1) and FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(i)</p>
<p>5. DEMONSTRATION OF CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS:</p>
<p>The U.S. Africa Command previously purchased High Frequency radio equipment for the African Union from the Harris Corporation under a contract with DRS technologies. This equipment is in use for current African Union operations, and therefore represents the interoperability baseline. Harris Corporation has provided an interoperable solution for linking this mission network to a continent-wide C2 network. The Directorate of Defense Trade Control (DDTC) has classified multiple equipment items in the Harris Corporation solution as defense articles. Defense articles are governed by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) laws and require approval by the DDTC in order to obtain an export license. There are three (3) countries in the African Union which are on the ITAR's proscribed country list that prevents US Government engagement projects. Therefore, the US Africa Command will be unable to obtain an export license for the ITAR-restricted Harris equipment. Past efforts to obtain ITAR waivers for ITAR-restricted Harris equipment have failed.</p>
<p>The US Africa Command then performed a market survey to identify an alternative vendor that could meet mission requirements and the interoperability baseline. The market survey concluded that CODAN Inc demonstrates unique capabilities for radio interoperability, as demonstrated in Afghanistan. CODAN Inc was provided with the same requirements as the Harris Corporation to develop a solution for the African Union Command, Control, Communications, and Information System. This sentence is not a justification for sole source, so I have removed. CODAN is the only vendor to offer exportable (i.e. non-ITAR-rated) equipment proven to meet mission requirements, operational goals and subsequent deadlines. CODAN High Frequency radios are manufactured and sold by an Australian company and thus governed and controlled by legislation issued by the Australian government. CODAN High Frequency radios are therefore not subject to the US Department of State's Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and the equipment does not require a commodity jurisdiction under the US Munitions List. An export license is only required by the Australian Government for encryption and frequency hopping modes only; the basic radio configuration does not require an export license. This phrase/sentence seems to be in conflict with the reason we are going sole source to Codan. Maybe we need to include more in this phrase or remove this phrase. Please reread and revise. The reason we are going to Codan is the export license therefore the phrase as is contradicts. To this end, approval typically takes 6-8 weeks to obtain a permit from the Australian DoD. We are not going sole source based on urgent and compelling so the timeframe to get the permit is irrelevant.</p>
<p>Further, current CODAN High Frequency radio networks in Africa support African Union missions with the NGT series of High Frequency radios, internally fitted with CODAN CALM (CODAN Automatic Link Management) and CODAN Voice Encryption. CODAN is the only source of supply available to the African Union to ensure the High Frequency radios sought under this acquisition are fully interoperable with existing CODAN-based High Frequency radio networks. Technical interoperability comprises CODAN proprietary encryption, MIL-STD-188-141B Automatic Link Establishment (ALE), with CODAN Automatic Link Management certified via Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) and Over-The-Air (OTA) radio status capabilities. In addition, CODAN is able to provide high power High Frequency radios supporting up to 1000 watts of output power, critical to support the High Frequency radio links specified under the AUC3IS program requirements. USAFRICOM also intends to utilize CODAN's existing service support center network throughout Africa to reduce costs associated with in-country logistics and sustained support to this program. It is therefore critical to procure High Frequency radios fully interoperable with CODAN in order to fulfill USAFRICOM's African Union Command, Control, and Communications Information Systems (AUC3IS) mission to support present and future African Union peacekeeping operations.</p>
<p>Installation of CODAN equipment by non-CODAN certified installers will void the warranties of existing equipment, thereby causing unacceptable delays and additional costs to the African Union and USG when maintenance is required. Therefore, certified CODAN installers are required to fulfill equipment warranty validation (three years on manufacturing, design and/ or component defects).<br /><br />6. FEDBIZOPPS ANNOUNCEMENT/POTENTIAL SOURCES: This J&amp;A will be posted on FEDBIZOPPS.</p>
<p>7. DETERMINATION OF FAIR AND REASONABLE COST: The anticipated cost to the US Government will be determined fair and reasonable prior to award.</p>
<p><br />8. MARKET RESEARCH: The following table was compiled as a market survey of exportable military-grade High Frequency radios, the manufacturers, their country of origin, and the available encryption options. Due to the austere operating environment, the radios must be military-grade and resistant to extreme temperatures, humidity, corrosion, dust, and contact with direct sunlight. In order to securely interoperate with the existing Harris high frequency radios owned and operated by the African Union, the radios must feature AES 256-bit encryption or Citadel encryption. In order to be exported to the African Union (ITAR exempt), these radios must not originate from the United States. Based on link modeling and analysis performed independently by CODAN and Harris, these radios must utilize the entire High Frequency spectrum (3 to 30 Mhz) and have the capability to be connected to a high-power amplifier (400W minimum) to ensure reliable, continuous operation between sites over challenging terrain. These radios also cannot be designated AN/PRC or PSC (Army-Navy portable radio component/portable secure radio component) equipment, as these designations connote restrictions on whom can purchase the equipment (usually only US military and allies). Entities such as the African Union and the regional economic centers are not military organizations or US allies. Based on the constraints above, CODAN is the sole High Frequency radio manufacturer that can provide a solution which will interoperate with the existing African Union High Frequency radio network. All other manufacturers in the table are either restricted by ITAR, encryption type, or output power, and do not meet the established requirements. <br /><br />Manufacturer Radio Country Encryption Notes<br />Barrett 2090 Australia None (external only) No AES or Citadel option<br />CODAN 2110M Australia AES-256, CES-256 1000W max<br />CODAN NGT ASR Australia AES-256, CES-256 1000W max<br />Datron PRC1099A USA US-only, Datron-proprietary ITAR-restricted, 400W max<br />Datron RT7000 USA US-only, Datron-proprietary ITAR-restricted, 5000W max<br />Elbit Tadiran HF-6000HDR Israel Tadiran-proprietary 4000W max<br />Elbit Tadiran THF-8000 Israel Tadiran-proprietary 4000W max<br />Elbit Tadiran Micom-3 Pathfinder Israel AES-256 125W max<br />Harris RF-5800H USA AES-256, Citadel ITAR-restricted, 400W max<br />L-3 WAVpac USA AES-256 ITAR-restricted, 150W max<br />Rohde &amp; Schwarz M3TR-MR300xH Germany RSCA (R&amp;S proprietary) 500W max, No AES or Citadel option<br />Selex CNR-2000 Italy Proprietary TRANSEC/COMSEC No AES or Citadel option<br />Thales TRC 3700 France Proprietary COMSEC No AES or Citadel option</p>
<p>9. ANY OTHER SUPPORTING FACTS: All CODAN equipment and installers must certify that they are CODAN certified as of the date of the submission of their offer and that all certifications/ specializations required as defined by CODAN to support the product sale, support and product pricing, have been met.</p>

ACTIONS TAKEN TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO COMPEITION: USAFRICOM fully supports competition among vendors and brands. Although this document is for a sole source item, a requirements document was provided to the vendors for equal competition.</p>
<p>12. REFERENCE TO THE APPROVED ACQUISITION PLAN (AP) PROGRAM PLAN (PP):</p>
<p>The Department of State (DoS) provided USAFRICOM with a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between DoS and USAFRICOM for the implementation. If DITCO requires reviewing of the sensitive signed document, the internal document will be provided upon request with the understanding the document should be reviewed only by DITCO personnel needing to conduct their duties.<br /><br />TECHNICAL CERTIFICATION: "I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance which are included in the J&amp;A are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief."

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, Office of Acquisition and Grants, Sacramento Branch intends to negotiate and award a noncompetitive simplified acquisition (purchase order) with the Research Corporation of the University of Hawaii, as fiscal agent for University of Hawaii at Hilo and the Center for the Study of Active Volcanoes (CSAV) to conduct an international training course designed to disseminate knowledge and techniques for forecasting volcanic eruptions to scientists from developing nations.  The emphasis of the training course is on the development of practical skills, integrating both field and classroom experiences.  The field training emphasizes volcano monitoring methods currently in use by the USGS.  Participants are taught the use and maintenance of volcano monitoring instruments.  The training program addresses the assessment of volcanic hazards and the interrelationship of scientists, government officials, and the news media during volcano crises.  Completion of the program results in a certification in volcano monitoring.
CSAV is a joint venture between the University of Hawaii at Hilo, the University of Hawaii at Manoa, and the U.S. Geological Surveys Hawaiian Volcano Observatory.  CSAV is the only institution in the United States which offers formal training in the monitoring of active volcanic processes and managing volcanic crises.  Therefore, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.106-1(b)(1), there is only one source reasonably available which can meet the immediate requirement described above.
The proposed action will be a firm-fixed price purchase order awarded noncompetitively in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) as stated above, utilizing the Simplified Acquisition Procedures of FAR Part 13.  Any other interested and capable sources may submit a capabilities statement to the Contracting Officer via email at jcaravelli@usgs.gov for the purposes of determining whether competitive opportunities exist.  Capabilities statements must specifically address the requirements described above and demonstrate existing expertise in providing comprehensive training in volcano monitoring techniques.  Capabilities statements must be transmitted not later than close of business local time Friday, 22 April 2011 to be considered for this immediate acquisition.

The total capacity of the base plus two option periods shall not exceed $30,000,000.  The task orders anticipated for this contract will be for projects in support of the 88th Regional Support Command (RSC) at sites in the States of Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana and for other customers supported by the Seattle District Corps of Engineers throughout Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana.  This type of contract vehicle is expected to help minimize design effort and related overhead expenditures and handle compressed delivery schedules.  The task orders under this contract are anticipated to range from $50,000 to $2,000,000 per task order and will be for projects of varying size and complexity.  Task orders will include multi-disciplinary maintenance and repair and minor construction work and may include a variety of trades such as carpentry, road repair, roofing, excavation, interior/exterior elements, mechanical, electrical, steam welding, asbestos, lead paint abatement incidental to construction, and/or project design.  The contract may also be used for some, but few, design-build task orders; however, the majority of task orders can be expected to require some incidental design effort by the Contractor.  Examples of typical incidental designs include, but are not limited to, fire alarm systems, fire sprinkler systems, HVAC system installation and balancing, communications systems, structural design of minor facilities or components and licensed professional engineer certification of site adaptation of pre-engineered structures.

The performance period under this SATOC will include a one-year base period, with the option to extend for two (2) additional one-year option periods, for a total contract period Not-to-Exceed (NTE) three (3) years.  The maximum value of all work issued under this SATOC will be limited to $30 Million over the life of the contract.  <br><br>The primary North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, with a small business size standard of $33.5 Million.  As a 100% HUBZone Small Business set-aside, the solicitation for this requirement will be open to all eligible HUBZone small business concerns.  For the purposes of this procurement, a concern is considered a small business if its average annual gross revenue, taken for the last 3 fiscal years, does not exceed $33.5 Million. <br><br>IMPORTANT NOTICE: All contractors proposing on Department of Defense solicitations must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to award of the contract. The purpose of this database is to provide basic business information and capabilities to the Government. The CCR website can be accessed at www.ccr.gov.

If, after reviewing this document, you desire to participate in the market research, you should provide documentation that supports your company's capability in meeting these requirements. Failure to provide documentation may result in the government being unable to adequately assess your capabilities. If you lack sufficient experience in a particular area, please provide details explaining how you would overcome the lack of experience/capabilities in order to perform that portion of the requirement (i.e., teaming, subcontracting, etc.) Both large and small businesses are encouraged to participate in this Market Research. Joint ventures or teaming arrangements are encouraged. <br /><br />The Air Force Metrology and Calibration Program is considering a purchase of a Liquid Flow Calibrators - High Range. The acquisition for Liquid Flow Calibrators - High Range (LFC-HR) will be for approximately nine high range liquid flow calibrators with a range of approximately 0.1 to 350 gallons per minute (GPM). The overall uncertainty of flow rate delivered to the meter under test will be +/- 0.05% of reading or better. The LFC-HR will utilize a pneumatically driven piston and will operate in a single direction (i.e. it will not be allowed to deliver flow to the meter under test in both directions of piston travel). The piston will retract to its starting position automatically upon completion of its stroke. The LFC-HR will set flow rates by way of a minimum of three different sized manual flow control valves (automatic valves will not be acceptable). The LFC-HR will have the ability to control the temperature of the calibration fluid up to 140 degrees Fahrenheit and down to 40 degrees Fahrenheit (dictated by a lab's chilling provisions). The LFC-HR will be capable of flowing hydrocarbon liquids (e.g. 7024, 7808), water, and propylene glycol (including mixtures of propylene glycol and water). The LFC-HR will be capable of measuring voltage, current, and frequency inputs which will be processed by a complete data acquisition and software package that will manage all data collection and processes. The software will be the user's interface to operate most of the LFC-HR functions.<br />The LFC-HR will utilize the complete conservation of mass flow rate equation which, in addition to compensating for temperature differences between the piston and meter under test, will account for thermal instabilities during standard volume delivery (i.e. account for storage effects during standard volume delivery). To this end: 1) sufficient temperature probes will be required between the cylinder discharge (final purchase description will provide additional detail); 2) the software will need to know the volume between the piston and meter under test at the completion of a standard volume delivery (i.e. absolute position of the piston in the cylinder and volume of the cylinder and volume of connecting piping must be known); and 3) the software will be required to process this information to determine flow rate delivered to the meter under test.<br />The LFC-HR will have the necessary integrated hardware and software provisions in order for the lab to perform water/gravimetric draws, and to then update the software with the results. The LFC-HR will come with all necessary hardware and software to operate the unit. The computer may or may not be integrated into the LFC-HR, but will need to be positioned in such a way that the operator can clearly observe and operate it while setting flow rates with the manual flow control valves. The LFC-HR will come with a three year warranty."
<p>The Air Force Metrology and Calibration Program is also considering a purchase of a Liquid Flow Calibrators - Low Range. The acquisition for Liquid Flow Calibrators - Low Range (LFC-LR) will be for approximately eight low range liquid flow calibrators with a range of approximately 0.01 to 10 gallons per minute (GPM). The overall uncertainty of flow rate delivered to the meter under test will be +/- 0.05% of reading or better. The LFC-LR will utilize a pneumatically driven piston and will operate in a single direction (i.e. it will not be allowed to deliver flow to the meter under test in both directions of piston travel). The piston will retract to its starting position automatically upon completion of its stroke. The LFC-LR will set flow rates by way of a minimum of three different sized manual flow control valves (automatic valves will not be acceptable).

<p>Notice Type: <br />Sources Sought</p>
<p><br />STUDY OF THE FOOD DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM ON INDIAN RESERVATIONS</p>
<p>This is a Sources Sought Notice for market research purposes only and is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). A solicitation is not being issued at this time and this notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service intends to issue a competitive small business set-aside procurement for advisory and assistance services to conduct the Study of the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations. Preference will be given to small businesses and small businesses owned by Native American Indians.</p>
<p>The Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR) is administered at the Federal level by the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) and administered locally by either Indian Tribal Organizations (ITOs) that are determined capable or an agency of a State government. FDPIR provides commodity foods to low-income American Indians living in designated areas. Many households participate in FDPIR as an alternative to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly named the Food Stamp Program (FSP). In fiscal year (FY) 2010, Federal program costs totaled $92 million, including $48 million for food commodities. <br />In FY 2010, 5 States and 100 ITOs operated 112 programs on 276 Indian reservations, pueblos, Rancherias, and Alaska Native Villages across 25 States. Two-thirds of all participants resided in designated areas located in 4 States: Oklahoma, Arizona, South Dakota, and California. Another quarter was from areas in 8 other States. By FNS regions, half of the ITO's and two-thirds of FDPIR participants are in the Southwest and Western regions. About another quarter of the ITO's and 30 percent of participants are in the Mountain Plains. The remainder, almost a quarter of the ITOs and 10 percent of FDPIR participations are in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions.</p>
<p>Income and resource standards for FDPIR eligibility are set by the Federal government and generally correspond to the requirements used in SNAP with a few exceptions. Households, however, may not participate in FDPIR and SNAP in the same month. A recent study (http://www.urban.org/uploadedpdf/412034_tribal_food_assistance.pdf) estimated that 85 percent of households that are eligible for either program are eligible for both. The study also identified a number of factors that influence the choice of either program by eligible American Indians. These include the size of the benefit for which the household would qualify for, the ease of enrollment (e.g., program requirements, office location), cultural compatibility issues, choice of selection of food, and access to grocery stores.</p>
<p><br />USDA purchases and ships foods to the ITOs and State agencies in accordance with their periodic orders of available items. The standard food package must contain items from different food categories and comply with FNS guide rates which enables program managers to select products within the budget constraint. The administering agencies also determine applicants' eligibility, store and distribute the commodities, and provide nutrition education to recipients. The main delivery modes for food packages, in order of prevalence, are pickups at the main or satellite warehouses, tailgate pickups, and store pickups. USDA provides the administering agencies with funds for program administrative costs.</p>
<p>Since its establishment in 1977, there have been numerous changes in FDPIR affecting eligibility, customer service, allocation of Federal funds among ITO's and State agencies, and improvements in the types and variety of products offered in the food packages. FDPIR participation data (available from FY 1999) indicate that a significant segment of low-income American Indians continue to rely on FDPIR benefits, but that participation has declined every year except for FY 2008 and 2009 when levels increased before decreasing again in FY 2010 (http://www.fns.usda.gov/pd/fdpmain.htm).<br />Detailed information on FDPIR administration and participants is sparse. At the national level, data are available on the monthly counts of participants by ITOs and State agencies and the dollars spent on commodities issued and the related program administration. The primary source of detailed information has been special studies. <br />The Evaluation of the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservation conducted by Research Triangle Institute and published by FNS in 1990 (http://www.fns.usda.gov/ora/menu/Published/FoodDistribution/FDStudies.htm <br />is the only study to provide nationally representative profiles of FDPIR participants and programs characteristics. It was conducted when the program was just over 10 years old, served 138,000 persons through 105 local programs and offered a commodity package based on a limited list of canned and packaged foods. The evaluation study used a multi-stage sample design to select 31 programs across the country from three strata of program size. The final stage was a probability sample of households selected from lists of participants provided by these ITOs and States.</p>
<p>Case record abstractions and household interviews (and a small number of focus groups) were conducted to obtain information on household size and composition, characteristics of individual participants, economic status, housing and transportation, dietary needs and adequacy of the household food supply, and food preferences. Essentially 31 case studies were performed to obtain program level data. Most staff and managers were interviewed on-site; the rest of the surveys were conducted over the telephone. Consistent information was collected on organization structure, financing, staffing, outreach activities, certification processes, and nutrition education. The study also documented the ordering process, storage by ITOs and State agencies, distribution methods and the range of items provided in the benefit package. Program integrity was examined in terms of household verification requirements, procedures to prevent dual participation, claims and disqualification procedures, inventory controls and Federal oversight by FNS regional staff. A third component of the RTI study provided comparisons between various aspects of FDPIR and FSP.<br />. <br />This procurement will provide current nationally representative information on the characteristics of FDPIR participants and local program administration. Information on perceptions about the program and potential access barriers will also be obtained in order to identify, if possible, the reasons for declining participation. The study objectives are:</p>
<p>1. Provide a demographic and socioeconomic profile of households and individuals that currently participate in FDPIR.<br />2. Evaluate the adequacy of the household food supply among FDPIR participants.<br />3. Provide information on American Indians who live on reservations and participate in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).<br />4. Quantify how American Indian households participate in FDPIR and SNAP over a year and determine the main reasons for movement between the two programs. <br />5. Explore the reasons why fewer American Indians are participating in FDPIR in recent years.<br />6. Provide descriptive information on FDPIR operations that address outreach, certification, and nutrition education.<br />7. Describe the resources devoted to nutrition education and the format of the information provided directly to FDPIR participants.<br />8. Identify the factors that determine which commodities are ordered from FNS.<br />9. Describe the approaches used for distributing food packages to participants and why they are selected.<br />10. Ascertain participant satisfaction with administrative practices and the food package.</p>
<p>Information for this descriptive study should come from program records and interviews with program staff, program managers, participants and non-participants. The information must be nationally representative and take into consideration the large variation in the sizes of local FDPIR programs across the country.</p>
<p>This study will be conducted in consultation with tribal leadership in accordance with the Executive Order 13175 Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments. This order recognizes tribal rights of self-government and tribal sovereignty, and affirms and commits the federal government to work with American Indian tribal governments on a government-to-government basis.</p>
<p>FNS is seeking firms with the capability of:<br />&bull; designing and conducting a nationally representative data collection, <br />&bull; conducting surveys, <br />&bull; managing and analyzing large data sets, <br />&bull; producing a high quality report, and<br />&bull; establishing successful relationships with Native American tribal governments .</p>
<p>The firm must demonstrate the availability of adequate staff who are experienced in disciplines critical to the successful completion of the study objectives, including project management, evaluation design, survey methods, data collection techniques (including recruitment and training of field staff), descriptive and inferential statistics, and database management.</p>
<p>Finally, the firm must demonstrate an understanding of the special requirements of working with Indian Tribal governments and of the culture and environment of the American Indians that would be asked to participate in this study.</p>
<p>Interested parties may submit capability statements that demonstrate its ability to perform all elements of the requirements as described in this notice. In addition, your response must include a description of your past experience on at least three (3) similar projects consistent in scope, size and complexity with this requirement which you performed in the past three years; and description of staff experience and skills.</p>
<p><br />Any information provided by industry to the Government as a result of this sources sought synopsis is strictly voluntary.. No entitlements to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges to the Government will arise as a result of offeror submission of responses, or the Government's use of such information. The information obtained from responses to this notice may be used in the development of an acquisition strategy and future RFP. No questions will be entertained or comment responded to by the Government. Offerors capable of providing these services should submit the information requested above via e-mail to ty.sar@fns.usda.gov and no later than 2PM Eastern Standard Time, April, 20, 2011</p>
<p>Please limit the length of the packages to 20 pages. Packages over 20 pages will not be evaluated. <br />&emsp;<br />Attachment<br />Additional Information on Procurement</p>
<p>Scope of Study</p>
<p>This study will provide nationally representative information on FDPIR participants and local programs for a recent period. This study will also collect information on other factors, such as SNAP participation, that will be used to examine and attempt to explain observed declines in FDPIR participation in recent years.</p>
<p>Demographic information on FDPIR households will be collected from a national probability sample of FDPIR case records that is large enough to detect differences in participation among major subgroups and across program characteristics that may affect FDPIR access. Additional information on these households will be collected from other State and local program records and interviews with household members. The latter will collect data that describes participation in SNAP and other nutrition programs, access to food stores, facilities for storing and preparing food, and perspectives on FDPIR customer service.</p>
<p>Data on participants must be linked to nationally representative program data. For selected programs, descriptive information will be obtained from extant sources such as plans of operation, inventory records and ordering manifestos and from interviews with program managers and staff. Other potential sources are interviews with agencies and local service organizations that are knowledgeable about other nutrition programs accessed by American Indians in the reservation served by the sampled ITO.</p>
<p>Among the risk factors that must be addressed in this study are:</p>
<p>&bull; obtaining consent and cooperation from tribes on the purpose and methods of the study, <br />&bull; taking cultural differences into consideration when conducting the study, including time commitments for tribal celebrations, hunting or fishing when scheduling interviews with staff or survey respondents, <br />&bull; identifying suitable sample frames for the household level sample for case record abstractions and surveys, <br />&bull; obtaining sufficient response rates in standardized surveys of FDPIR participants, former participants and potentially eligible nonparticipants, and<br />&bull; designing instruments that capture information on enrollment decisions that explain why participation in FDPIR has declined overtime. <br />&emsp;<br />Directives for Offerors</p>
<p>1. Offerors shall provide a discussion of how they will consult with the tribes about the purpose and methods of this study and solicit ideas that would contribute to the success of the project (such as obtaining full cooperation from program staff and survey respondents).</p>
<p>2. Offerors shall provide a detailed discussion of their design of the nationally representative sample of FDPIR participant households for purposes of the case record abstraction, including</p>
<p>a. Steps to include representation of different sized programs and programs in different FNS regions.<br />b. Steps to identify a suitable sampling frame at FDPIR sites. <br />c. The logistics and feasibility of obtaining case records for abstraction of demographic and program data.<br />d. Target sample size, response rates, sampling weights and design effect.<br />e. Description of the challenges posed by this research and how they will be addressed. <br />f. The number of households studied must be large enough to produce precise and reliable statistics for the full FDPIR sample and major subgroups such as households of different sizes and households with elderly members.</p>
<p>3. Offerors shall provide a detailed discussion of their sampling and data collection plans for surveys of FDPIR participants, former participants and nonparticipant, including</p>
<p>a. A critique the merits of interviewing participants, former participants and nonparticipants for their perceptions about FDPIR benefits and service. <br />b. Methods of contacting and obtaining information from respondents.<br />c. Expected response rates and strategies for maximizing completion rates.<br />d. Plans for capturing information from designated respondents who do not have telephones, live in remote areas, or have limited reading ability.<br />e. Description of the information that will be collected. <br />f. The pros and cons of offering incentive payments to survey subjects.<br />g. Description of the challenges posed by this research and how they will be addressed.</p>
<p>4. Offerors shall provide a detailed discussion of their data collection plans for obtaining descriptive information about FDPIR programs, including</p>
<p>a. The identity of likely subjects for in-depth interviews<br />b. Plans for on-site visits and/or telephone interviewing.<br />c. Identification of other likely sources of data<br />d.

<DESC>NASA/KSC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for theRefurbishment of a Mini Portable Purge Unit.The Project consists of the turnkey supply of refurbishment one existing Mini PortablePurge Unit (MPPU).The MPPUs have been used in support of the current space shuttle program to supplyenvironmentally controlled air to various compartments within the shuttle. The MPPUs arebeing refurbished in order to increase their performance and extend their service life.The purpose of the refurbished MPPUs is to provide a supply of conditioned air formaintaining required temperature, pressure, and humidity levels within various Orion andAres I compartments. The MPPU provides purge air to the Orion Service Module/SpacecraftAdapter (SM/SA), the Orion Crew Module/Crew Cabin (CM/CC), and the CM/Soft Cover (SC)while in the Main Payload Processing Facility while under transport between KSCfacilities, and during rollout to the launch pad. The MPPUs are complete, self-containedair processing units that are housed in tow-around trailers. They are electricallypowered and computer controlled. The units take in atmospheric air and filter it,compress it, and dehumidify it. The air is then ducted to the Orion or Ares I Upper Stagethrough three separate duct systems. The air to each duct is independently controlled tosupply the required flow rate at the correct temperature and pressure. The operatorcontrols the MPPU locally via a front panel or remotely via a network interface.The existing MPPUs have been in service for over 15 years. Therefore, many components areno longer commercially available. The structural steel and panels have peeling paint andsurface corrosion. The control system is obsolete and replacement parts are becomingdifficult to obtain. Also, the refrigeration system uses R-22 which is considered to bean ozone-depleting substance.Additionally, there is performance limitations associated with the existing MPPUs. First,the capacity of the refrigeration system is insufficient to provide the required level ofcooling on hot/humid days. Therefore, the temperature of the purge air that is deliveredto the flight vehicle is warmer than desired. Also, the supply temperature fluctuatesexcessively as compressors are turned off and on. On extremely cold days, the electricheaters are insufficient to deliver air at the required temperature.This refurbishment project will address the issues listed above by rehabilitating thestructural framework, refurbishing or replacing system components, installing a newcontrol system, and installing a new refrigeration system that has increased capacity anduses R410A refrigerant. The size of the electric heaters will also be increased.The existing MPPU is currently located at the Kennedy Space Center.  No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If asolicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA AcquisitionInternet Service.  It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these sitesfor the release of any solicitation or synopsis.Responses must include the following:  name and address of firm, size of business;average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; whether theyare large, or any category of small business*, number of years in business; affiliateinformation:  parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, primecontractor (if potential sub) or subcontractors (if potential prime); list of customerscovering the past five years (highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers,contract type, dollar value of each procurement; and point of contact - address and phonenumber).  *NASA is seeking capabilities from all categories of SB for the purpose of determiningthe appropriate level of competition and/or SB subcontracting goals for thisrequirement."Please advise if the requirement is considered to be a commercial or commercial-typeproduct.  A commercial item is defined in FAR 2.101.This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as acommitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.

<DESC><p>SMALL BUSINESS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE</p>
<p><br />Notice Number: HHS-NIH-NCI-SBSS-TSB-07015-10</p>
<p>Title: Administrative Support Services for the Office of Grants Administration</p>
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought (SBSS) notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your response to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement as a set-aside based upon responses to this Notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Interested parties are expected to review this Notice and the draft Statement of Work to familiarize themselves with the requirements of this project; failure to do so will be at your firm's own risk.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The Document Management Center (DMC), located within the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Office of Grants Administration (OGA), initiates and follows through with specific actions in support of the grant award process. DMC operates in direct support of NCI's Office of Grants Administration (OGA). OGA's responsibilities are complex and critical in funding nearly two-thirds of NCI's budget to grantee institutions around the world. OGA provides grants management oversight to ensure the timely and accurate issuance of NCI grant awards. OGA evaluates and monitors the business management capability and performance of grant applicant organizations and awardees as well as the internal operating procedures associated with the business management aspects of the financial assistance process. OGA also interprets and develops grants management policy.</p>
<p><br />Purpose and Objectives:</p>
<p>The purpose of this Small Business Sources Sought Notice is to identify qualified small business concerns including HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses that are interested in and capable of performing the work described herein. The NCI does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses received nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted.</p>
<p>As a result of this SBSS Notice, the NCI may issue a Request for Proposal (RFP). THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NCI shall arise as a result of a response to this Small Business Sources Sought Notice or the NCI's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to obtain contract support services for the operation of the Document Management Center (DMC), located within the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Office of Grants Administration (OGA). DMC is a key unit that assists NCI/OGA in achieving its goals and objectives.</p>
<p>DMC is the NCI receipt point for all NCI grant applications that are first received by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). DMC also scans paper-based grants documents into eGrants and provides quality control to assure that the document images are accurate and readable. In cases where DMC receives an electronic version and a paper version of the same grant application, DMC compares the two documents to verify that they are exactly the same. DMC reviews all grant documents, especially grant applications, for missing, incorrect, outdated, and/or inconsistent information prior to award preparation by the OGA grants management specialist. Grant application deficiencies are tracked and logged to generate deficiency letters which are sent to grantees so that they can provide the necessary information. Grant application deficiencies are also tracked for future reference and retrieval and for making grant deficiency reports. As grantees provide requested information, DMC logs their arrival, enters the information into the grant file folder, and notifies the assigned OGA grants management specialist as to the status and/or completeness of the grant file folder. DMC monitors and tracks the contents and whereabouts of OGA's grant file folders. DMC adds correspondence and other relevant documents to the appropriate grant file folder (whether it is a paper file folder or an electronic file folder). DMC delivers and retrieves grant file folders to and from OGA staff at their request. DMC takes special care in delivering, retrieving, and reshelving grant file folders in a timely and accurate manner. Additionally, the NCI Office of Acquisition (NCI/OA) requires support services to convert paper contract documents/files to electronic documents/files and index the electronic files within an electronic document management system (called an "eContracts Document Management System").</p>
<p>Specific Tasks:</p>
<p>The specific tasks discussed in detail in the following draft Statement of Work (SOW) will focus on quality electronic grants management assurance measures. Therefore, the contractor must have an understanding of the operational and electronic environment in which NCI/OGA operates, an expertise in performing the tasks specified in this SOW, and an ability to adapt to new technology and systems.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall perform, at the times and locations noted the following tasks and shall verify that all tasks are completed accurately and timely.</p>
<p>All errors are to be corrected by the Contractor at the Contractor's expense.</p>

<CONTACT>Guy H. Hillman, Contractin Officer, Phone 6174943401, Email Guy.Hillman@dot.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT), Research and Innovative Technology Administration, John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center), Cambridge, MA, is conducting a sources sought notice to locate business concerns for the field operational experiment and data analysis of driver adaptation to crash warning products (referred to as FOE). The purpose of the FOE is to assess how drivers adapt to crash warning systems based on long-term exposure in a naturalistic driving environment. Data acquisition systems (DAS) will be installed to collect numerical and video data. Some of the vehicle data to be collected includes vehicle acceleration, velocity, yaw rate, turn signal use, brake and throttle application, headway to a lead vehicle, etc. The files downloaded from the real-time cameras will contain views of the driver's face, forward scene of the vehicle, left side, right side, vehicle rear, and over the driver shoulder. The information obtained from the vehicle data channels and video files will allow the U.S. DOT to investigate driver adaptation by examining, in detail, behavioral measures such as travel speed, longitudinal headway, unintended lane excursion, turn signal use during lane change, and distraction rate. Driver exposure rate and response to driving conflicts will also be measured.<br />The results obtained from the experiment will also let the U.S. DOT determine more accurate estimates of the effects of crash warning products on long-term driver behavior that could affect the safety of distracted drivers. Specifically, the results of such an experiment will be used to address the following objectives:<br />&bull; Provide a better prediction of driver risk compensation and other unintended consequences;<br />&bull; Gauge driver acceptance;<br />&bull; Identify factors that could increase safety benefits and minimize possible adverse effects;<br />&bull; Promote the technology to increase deployment, and<br />&bull; Support rulemaking and safety standards by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).<br />A complete performance work statement will be set forth in the Request for Proposal (RFP). <br />Issuance will be on or about June 20, 2011. The applicable North American<br />Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541720 and the<br />small business size standard is $7.0 million dollars. This procurement will be conducted in<br />accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation. All contractors must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to receive award from a DOT Agency. Contractors may access the site at http://www.ccr.gov to register and/or obtain information about the registration process. Additionally, solicitation Representation and Certifications are no longer provided within the solicitation and must be submitted on-line through On-Line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). ORCA is a web based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of the Representations and Certifications required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations. Potential Offerors are highly encouraged to complete the on-line provisions within the Representations and Certifications at https://orca.bpn.gov. Telephone calls will not be accepted. The following notice is provided for informational purposes for Minority, Women-Owned and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises. The Department of Transportation (DOT), Short-Term Lending Program (STLP) offers working capital financing in the form of lines of credit to finance accounts receivable for transportation related contracts. Maximum line of credit is $750,000 with interest at the prime rate, as published daily in the Wall Street Journal, plus 1.75 percent.

To notify potential Offerors of the Government's intent to solicit a brand name(s) only component under future construction projects.<br><br>B.   To identify potential sources that can provide an equivalent to the brand name only item.<br><br>C.  Notification of the Army's intent to solicit brand name components as described below.<br><br>The items described below, under summary of requirements, are embedded in the construction projects.  The projects will be issued competitively.  Only the components described below will be sole source, if no other sources are identified that can provide an equivalent system.  In the event no equivalent sources are found the brand name only justification will be issued pursuant to FAR Part 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source.  A subsequent market survey will not be published in support of a Justification and Approval for sole sourcing.    Supplies of the brand name component will be provided directly to the Contractor(s) and not to the Government.<br><br>Summary of Requirements:<br><br>A.  Complete Monaco Fire Alarm System (estimated cost = $200K):<br><br>Due to post wide compatibility issues and based on the capabilities described below of a Monaco Fire Alarm system, all new construction and renovation projects at the USMA, West Point are now featuring the latest version of the Monaco Fire Alarm Control Panel. The  MAAP Plus Analog Addressable Integrated Radio Transceiver and Fire Alarm Control Panel is capable of point reporting up to 1584 addressable device points via proprietary UHF radio signal to the Monaco D-21 Enhanced Central Radio Control Alarm receiving system at West Point Fire Department Dispatch. New Fire Alarm installations include Mass Notification Systems (MNS) in accordance with DoD Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 4-021-01. The existing RF infrastructure provided by Monaco supports the UFC requirements for primary MNS communications. The Monaco Fire Alarm and integrated MNS system has the capability to remotely activate the in-building MNS messaging system and provide live-voice announcements directly from the D-21 Central Station at West Point Fire Dispatch.<br>SUBJECT: Sources Sought Notice for Sole Source Market Research for various MILCON projects at the USMA, West Point, NY<br><br>Each Fire Alarm System (FAS) and Mass Notification System (MNS) shall be a complete, supervised, non-coded, analog-addressable system, installed in class A configuration per NFPA 72. The FAS/MNS shall provide point reporting to the Fire Alarm Control Panel (FACP).

Point reporting, also known as point to point reporting, is the capability to relay the status of each addressable device and certain system components such as Signaling Line Circuits (SLC) to the D-21 Central Receiving Station in real time. The FAS/MNS shall be tested and perform as a critical life-safety system. The FAS/MNS shall be compatible with and shall communicate seamlessly with the D-21 Central Receiving Station, without impairing operational function or reliability of any existing FAS or MNS. Use of interfacing relays between the FACP and communications transceiver to provide point or zonal alarm trouble status shall not be permitted.                                                                          <br><br>	All devices must comply with the Aug 1997 Federal Wireless communication commissions office of engineering and technology Bulletin 65, Evaluating Compliance with the FCC Guideline's for Human Exposure to RF Electromagnetic Fields.<br><br><br>B. Best Hardware Lock Cylinders & Cores (Non-Electronic) (estimated cost = $30K) <br><br>Due to compatibility and consistency issues with keying at the USMA, Best lock is the USMA standard for lock hardware.  This applies to locks that are not electronic and have status monitor capabilities compatible with the electronic security access system.  Hardware locksets shall accommodate Best lock cylinders and cores. The Contractor shall provide cores to secure building during construction and shall turn over hardware cores to the government upon completion of construction.  Government will replace Contractor cores with Best lock cylinders and cores after each area of the projects are completed is turned over to Government.<br><br><br>C. Unicor System 2/90 Interior Signage (estimated cost = $50K)<br><br>The Unicor System 2/90 complies with the USMA standard signage guide. The standardization of a signage system at USMA allows for clarity of signage throughout the campus as well as a consistent signage appearance within the buildings on post. This standard should allow for more effective visual communications for the end users and improved circulation, as well as improved maintenance and management of the signage system.   Additionally, USMA has access to this manufacturer through maintenance plans and is able to order replacement signs as needed. <br><br>	<br>D. Hirsch Card Access System by Embrace Technologies (estimated cost = $50K)<br><br>Embrace Technologies is the only registered and certified contractor to perform all the card access work at the USMA, West Point.   Embrace uses the Hirsch Card Access Systems that are also certified DoD security system and used by West Point.<br><br><br>E.  Armstrong Bio-Based Vinyl (BBT) (estimated cost = $20K<br><br>Armstrong is the only known manufacturer that currently produces a bio-based option that meets the following LEED requirements:<br>  <br> 	Contributes to LEED (1 point):<br>1.	MR4.1:  Recycled Content, 10% (post-consumer + 1/2 pre-consumer)<br>2.	EQ4.3:  Low-Emitting Materials<br><br><br>F.  Wilsonart Industries Chemsurf Chemical Resistant Plastic Laminate (estimated cost = $50K)<br><br>Wilsonart is the only chemical-resistant plastic-laminate material currently available; there is no known equal. Chemical resistance is required for durability in laboratory areas. Features of the laminate are as follows:<br> 	High-pressure decorative laminate consisting of a resin formulation applied over the decorative surface paper to achieve chemical resistance. <br> 	The decorative paper shall be treated with melamine resin, and the core shall consist of kraft papers impregnated with phenolic resin. <br> 	Sheets shall be bonded under high temperature and pressure. <br> 	Finish: Fine beaded "crystal" texture to minimize smudges and finger marks, and to provide optimum scratch resistance.<br><br><br>G. Labconco Flaskscrubber Glassware Washers (estimated cost = $30K)<br><br>This brand of glassware washer was used on Phase I and has been used by the USMA prior.  In order to maintain uniformity for maintenance and operational purposes and exchangeability of accessories, this brand is proposed for Phase II.<br><br><br>H. Williams Electric Company (EMS Contractor Building Automation System (BAS)) - Energy Management System (EMS) Contractor (estimated cost = N/A)<br><br>The building automated system for energy monitoring proposed for this project is not sole sourced; however, the work and equipment that connects and interfaces this system with campus wide system is proprietary and maintained by Williams Electric Company (WEC).  WEC has been contracted by the USMA to maintain the campus EMS systems.  The USMA has also contracted WEC on previous projects to provide the interface work between BAS and campus EMS system.   The Contractor for these projects will be required to contract with WEC to provide and install the final interface equipment.<br><br><br>I. Evapco, Inc. Cooling Tower (estimated cost = $100K)<br><br>In Phase I of the Science Center project (currently under construction),  a large exterior screen wall, supporting structure and an area well, were all designed to accommodate a specific cooling tower brand and arrangement that will be installed under this contract (Phase II).  Other cooling towers have a different orientation and physical size characteristics, which would likely require substantial modification to the components needed to support and properly screen the cooling tower.  The screen walls are designed in accordance with Historical Preservation Guidelines for this building (which is in the National Historic Landmarks District).   To avoid this additional cost and delay to the Phase I contract, the Evapco cooling tower must be provided.<br><br>  	<br>J. Plumberex Trap Gear Soft Under-Lavatory Protectors <br><br>Plumberex is the only manufacturer that meets ASTM E84-07 Class A Material 25 Flame / 450 Smoke with regard to the smoke (450) standard for ADA compliant under counter lavatory insulation. Note that Three (3) other manufacturers make ADA compliant under counter lavatory insulation: Truebro Handi Lav-Guard, Brocar Trap Wrap, and McGuire Pro Wrap, but do not meet the flame and smoke rating s above.   <br><br><br>K.  Airtech Compressed Air and Vacuum systems for Science Labs<br><br>Airtech is a reputable manufacturer of compressed air and vacuum pump system in the North East Region with fast response time to any and all issues related to the equipment.  Airtech currently has equipment at the USMA.  The manufacturer is located in Englewood, NJ, less than 1-hour from post.  Due to compatibility and ongoing consolidation of maintenance program, the USMA would prefer to utilize this one source for this element of work.<br><br><br>Any vendor that wishes to provide an alternate source to the brand names above that is compatible with the above must provide a response with data supporting the claim within 15 business days of this announcement to New York District Corps Of Engineering, Contracting Division.<br><br>Submit responses via email with attached PDF document files to:<br>Matthew Lubiak, Contract Specialist, 917-790-8089, matthew.lubiak@usace.army.mil<br>

<DESC>The Army Contracting Command- Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG), MD 21005 intends to award a firm-fixed price contract utilizing Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The Government intends to issue on a sole source basis to Rubberlite, Inc., 2501 Guyan Avenue, Huntington, West Virginia 25703 under the statutory authority permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. <br><br>This requirement is to procure Neoprene Sponges and Polyethylene Foam for the Family of Concealable Body Armor (FoCBA) Stab Testing in support of Project Manager Soldier Protective Equipment (PM SPE). These products will be utilized for testing military police vests. The items anticipated in this requirement are: 335 sheets each of neoprene sponge, (5.8mm thick, Type SCE45, Shore A20-30) and 56 sheets each of polyethylene foam, (closed cell, 31mm thick, LD45, ShoreA14), per NIJ 0115.00 Stab Resistance Protection Standard. <br><br>At the present time, there are four known suppliers of the neoprene sponge and polyethylene foam all located in the United Kingdom and one supplier in the United States.  Market research indicates that none of these suppliers currently exist or produce the blades and spikes needed to satisfy the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) 0115.00 requirements. In order to locate a company within the United States that produces the engineered blades and engineered spikes required, various laboratories were contacted, including the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) and several independent NIJ test laboratories that purchase of neoprene sponge and polyethylene foam for body armor testing.  Each of these laboratories indicated that they purchase their neoprene sponge and polyethylene foam from the same source; Rubberlite, Inc. the only known source.  <br><br><br>Responsible parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement, no later than 18 April 2011.

<p style="text-align: center;">NOTICE<br /><br />The attached notice discusses research efforts for fiscal year 2011 and fiscal year 2012 under the connected vehicle certification program by the U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Research and Innovative Technology Administration's (RITA) Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) office Joint Program Office (JPO).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Detailed information can be found at</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Research Overview </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Connected vehicle certification is the process of ensuring that system components meet the necessary requirements to perform as intended. Certification ensures that components that are manufactured according to connected vehicle technology requirements will be trusted by the system and by users.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The vision for the Certification research is to work in close cooperation with public and private partners to establish appropriate certification requirements for equipment.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Research Goals</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To work with industry to define certification needs and to develop supporting test methods and&nbsp;tools.</p>
<p>To develop a plan so that in the future, certification activities will become self-sustaining&nbsp;through fees for testing; development of new requirements and test methods will be shaped by&nbsp;the organizations seeking those requirements.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Research Approach </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A successful deployment using connected vehicle technologies must address the inherent risks to consumer safety, security, and privacy associated with a system breakdown. With national interoperability comes the opportunity to establish national standards and criteria for certification of individual products that will have access to the system, system processes, and operational procedures. Because this is a new high-risk industry without an established consumer base, the Federal Government finds that an appropriate role is to work with industry to develop certification processes and procedures independently. The ultimate form that a certifying entity would take, and the role of Government in oversight and enforcement of requirements, are yet to be determined and will be investigated as part of both the technical research program as well as research into connected vehicle policy and institutional issue.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Certification research will be primarily focused on understanding the needs for device compliance, system security, and privacy requirements. The ITS Program will conduct the following research activities in support of certification:</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.25in; text-align: left; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2;"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol"><span>&bull;&middot;<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Policy Research Related to Certification</strong> - Establish a forum for solving policy-related issues, including determining what is to be certified, what entity is responsible for certification, and what parties need to obtain certification. This research is included within connected vehicle policy research program, and it is envisioned that government (U.S. DOT and State/local) will have the lead role in this research<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"> area. </strong></p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.25in; text-align: left; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2;"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol"><span>&bull;&middot;<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Technical Requirements for Certification</strong>- Define what level of items within a device or what interfaces need to be certified and how to accomplish the certification. It is envisioned that Government and industry will share responsibility for this area of work. However, Government will have a primary role in funding developments prior to a consumer market emerging for certified products. Government will serve as an enabler and coordinator of this function.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.25in; text-align: left; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2;"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol"><span>&bull;&middot;<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Implementation Support and Oversight</strong> - Executing the planned certification scheme will likely be done by a third-party entity. This includes development of test tools and methods. However, Government may have a role in assisting with start-up, and in overseeing operation and adherence to standards. This implies an ongoing operational role for Government beyond the scope of research.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Milestones for certification activities must match related milestones in the other program roadmaps. For instance, a 2013 milestone for potential rulemaking on equipment requirements in vehicles must be matched by a similar milestone to have certification requirements and processes established in time for implementation of the rule. More specific milestones will be established in conjunction with the development of the individual program roadmaps.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Research Outcomes: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The outcomes are intended to deliver:</p>

<p><br /><strong>STATEMENT OF WORK FOR 820th RED HORSE SQUADRON</strong></p>
<p>BACKGROUND: The 820th RED HORSE Squadron/ Vehicle Management Section conducts vehicle maintenance on a highly diverse construction fleet. Our mechanics use coveralls when they perform maintenance to keep uniforms clean. Rags are used when performing repairs to check fluids, wipe off parts and clean hands. With frequent deployments and changing projects it is difficult to predict how many rags and coveralls we will need cleaned each week. Also, we do not have the capability here to clean these rags and coveralls due to the chemicals they get soiled with. In light of these challenges, we are requesting that a local BPA be established to supplement our laundering needs.</p>
<p>1. SCOPE OF WORK: The contractor shall furnish all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision and other items and services necessary to provide laundry services on government owned rags and coveralls located at the 820th RED HORSE Squadron, Vehicle Management Section, Nellis AFB, Nevada.</p>
<p>2. LOCATION: The pick-up and delivery area is at the 820th RED HORSE Squadron Vehicle Management Section in Area 2, 5099 Mather Ave, Building 10148, Nellis AFB, NV, 89191.</p>
<p>3. DESCRIPTION OF WORK: Provide laundry service for government owned rags and coveralls. These rags and coveralls will be soiled with engine oil, hydraulic oil, transmission fluid, antifreeze, grease, solvents and cleaners. Items will be laundered so that there is no residue or odor of any of the products listed above remaining on them.</p>
<p>4. MINIMUM QUANTITIES: A call for service will only be placed when there is a minimum of 150 items that need to be laundered. This will include any combination of rags and coveralls that meets this minimum number. The vendor will pick up the rags and coveralls within 1 business day from the time the call is received.</p>
<p>5. TURNAROUND TIME: All coveralls and rags will be returned within 4 business days not to include the day of pick-up. All pick-up and deliveries shall be accomplished between the hours of 09:00 A.M. and 03:00 P.M., Monday through Friday. If the date of delivery falls on a holiday, the next business day following the holiday will be the date of delivery. For a list of Federal Holidays, use the following website:</p>
<p>http://www.opm.gov/Operating_Status_Schedules/fedhol/2011.asp</p>
<p><br />6. ACCOUNTABILITY: A representative from the vendor and a representative from the 820th RED HORSE Vehicle Management Section will perform a count of all coveralls and rags at the time of pick-up and delivery. This will ensure there are no discrepancies or accountability issues.</p>

<p><br />PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>1a. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Local Communications Services. This factor pertains to switch and PBX sites only.</p>
<p>This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Enhanced 911 Service.</p>
<p>This factor is met when the Offeror presents a detailed plan for interfacing and complying with State 911 requirements that meets the following criteria:<br />[a] A sound methodology of how the Offeror will comply with State 911 interface requirements for commercial subscriber lines and trunks.<br />[b] A sound methodology of their process for updating Automatic Line Identification 911 database.<br />[c] A description of alternating routes of 911</p>
<p>Factor 4 - Diversity.</p>
<p>This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound pictorial approach for diversity to include the methodology for accomplishing diversity.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.</p>
<p><br />PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>1b. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum:</p>

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC>Statement of Work<br />Temperature Monitoring System
<p><br />BACKGROUND<br />The National Institutes of Health Clinical Research Center (CRC) is a 240-bed hospital dedicated entirely to research into advances in medical science and public health. Every patient is enrolled in a research protocol. The Department of Laboratory Medicine serves as the clinical laboratory of the CRC. The Department provides laboratory support for patient care and research protocols on a 24-hour basis. The accreditation of the laboratory is contingent on compliant with regulations and policies from various regulatory agencies. One of these standards required the consistent, daily monitoring of temperatures of freezers and refrigerators that house patient samples and reagents used in the analysis of patient samples. Currently this is a manual, time consuming process that is performed by our technologists. Due to this manual approach we are never 100% compliant with this requirement and our non-compliance is usually noted at our annual inspections. Continuing with this manual process leaves us open to possible action by an accrediting agency.</p>
<p>PURPOSE<br />This request is for the initial purchase of 50 temperature monitoring devices as well as the needed software and hardware to operate the system. These will be placed on freezers and refrigerators within the department. The system should allow us to have continuous hands off temperature monitoring on our essential refrigerator and freezer units while also alerting us when a temperature is out of range.</p>
<p>SCOPE OF WORK <br />The NIH Clinical Laboratory requires a wireless temperature monitoring system to provide computer based real time temperature monitoring meeting compliance requirements from the Joint Commission (JC) and the College of American Pathologists (CAP). The software application must reside within and be the property of the NIH and allow for web based viewing via email, text, phone and/or visual alert functions to advise if equipment being monitored has exceeded temperature thresholds.</p>
<p>Wireless frequency must be compatible with the technology currently in place at the Clinical Center at NIH. The sophistication of the system to receive and store data is essential. There must be capability to store data and then restore data with an accurate date and time stamp in the event of a network failure. The system should also be adaptable so that additional probes can be easily added in the future.</p>
<p>Available sensors must include, but not be limited to probes which can monitor temperatures (from a range of -80C degrees to 50C degrees). Probes to detect/monitor CO2 levels, room temperature, humidity, and liquid nitrogen are desirable. The system should provide<br />immediate notification if temperature ranges or levels exceed threshold.</p>
<p>Probes must come with NIST traceable certificates and a seamless method for annual recalibration is necessary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS<br />This system will provide:<br />&bull; Software that can be placed on a PC or server that will run the system, process data, and produce results.<br />&bull; 50 sensor probes (wireless sensor) and supporting equipment<br />&bull; Alert lamp or visual notification when temperature ranges are exceeded</p>
<p>The system must operate on wireless hardware and must also be able to alert users 24/7 and be able to produce graphs and record of historical data. The user should be able to customize alert features. Each probe must be accompanied with a NIST traceable certificate of calibration. Replacement of the sensor probe should be user friendly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT<br />There will be minimal environmental impact. The actual probes will be placed in the refrigerator and freezer units and the system will use the wireless capabilities within the Clinical Center. Software will need to be placed on a server or PC within the Clinical Center.</p>

<CONTACT>Deborah G Culpepper, Phone 301-402-1928, Fax 301-402-1574, Email deborah_culpepper@nih.gov
<DESC>Project Title: Maintenance Support - Lawson Software
<p>Department: Clinical Center/National Institutes of Health/<br />Materials Management Department</p>
<p>Performance Period: June 1, 2011 - May 31, 2012<br /><br />Background</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's foremost federally funded biomedical research institution. NIH is comprised of twenty-seven Institutes, Centers, and Divisions. The Mark O. Hatfield Clinical Research Center (CRC) is the onsite hospital for the NIH campus, providing full support for clinical research in inpatient and outpatient settings. The CRC facility comprises three million square feet of clinical, laboratory, and administrative space with the capacity to serve 240 inpatients participating in research studies at the NIH..</p>
<p>The Materials Management Department (MMD) is responsible for the evaluation, acquisition, purchasing, inventory, storage and distribution of materials, supplies and equipment, and sterilization and decontamination services for medical surgical supplies; it also includes management of property, all of which is done in support of clinical research and patient safety.</p>
<p>The Storage and Distribution Section (S&amp;D) is committed to providing receiving, storage, distribution, and logistical support services to the NIH Clinical Center. The Storage and Distribution Section utilizes the Lawson Software to manage the NIH Clinical Center hospital supply inventory.</p>
<p>The Lawson Procurement application supports all aspects of procurement including both direct and indirect purchasing, management of supplier agreements, quality control, and claim handling. Through integration with all the M3 planning and execution applications, M3 Procurement dramatically simplifies buying activity. Sophisticated tools such as purchase delivery schedules and automated electronic message tool (EDI and XML) work alongside simple requisition and order management functions. <br />M3 Procurement streamlines the NIH Clinical Center's buying activity, reducing the cost of administration and execution, increasing the opportunity for significant cost savings through more comprehensive supplier management, and providing the necessary analysis to implement valuable supplier rating mechanisms<br />Purpose</p>
<p>The purpose of this Statement of work is to procure the on-site maintenance license for the NIH Clinical Center's Lawson Applications.</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
 Request For Quotation (RFQ) number is N66604-11-Q-2812. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334418.   Size standard is 500 employees.

<p>This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number HSCG38-11-Q-200066 is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).</p>
<p>This solicitation documented and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-51. The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413. The small business size standard is 1,000 employees. This is an unrestricted solicitation. Anticipated contract award date is September 16, 2011 however, this is an estimate and not exact.</p>
<p>This requirement is for spare parts for the HH65 USCG Aircraft.</p>
<p>The estimate quantity/parts list is attached in PDF and Excel to be used to submit your quote.</p>
<p><br />Award will be made to the offeror(s) proposing the best value to the Government considering technical capability, price, delivery and past performance.</p>
<p>An indefinite delivery Requirements contract is anticipated that will include a base year plus two option periods for a total period of performance of three years.</p>
<p>Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of our aircrew. Best Value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight. Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or standard military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation. Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred), a certificate of conformance and traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.</p>
<p>Alternate Parts will be authorized if they are an approved alternate under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) catalog system, which improves interoperability between NATO and commercial cataloging systems. Alternate parts must satisfy all form, fit, and function requirements of the original parts and conform to the approved configuration of the United States Coast Guard HH-65 aircraft.</p>

Offerors must be able to provide necessary certification including traceability to a manufacturer, manufacturer's COC, FAA 8130, and its own certificate of conformance to ensure parts are in airworthy condition, suitable for installation on U.S. Coast Guard aircraft. Prospective vendors who are not the OEM or an authorized distributor must provide traceability for the offered product back to the manufacturer or authorized distributor. Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.

Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested Parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>INFORMAL FORUM WITH THE OMBUDSMAN. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST WITH THE OMBUDSMAN: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protests to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>
<p><br />Commandant (GG-913)<br />U.S.Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement<br />1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402<br />Washington, DC 20593<br />Telephone: (202) 372-3692<br />Fax: (202) 475-3904</p>

EVALUATION PROCEDURES/BASIS FOR AWARD The Government intends to award a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) contract using FAR 15.101-2, Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA).
 Only one (1) award may be made to the responsible quoter(s) who:1) quotes the brand name items specified in the combined synopsis/solicitation, conforming to the delivery requirement and; 2) quotes the lowest evaluated price. Information submitted by the offeror must be suficient to establish that the quoter is proposing the brand name items specified above. Quoters are  required to submit quotations for all CLINs and the CLINs extended description if present. The Government intends to evaluate quotations and award a contract without discussions with quoters. Quotations should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.

Quoters are encouraged to use Standard Form 1449, Solicitation/Contract/ Order for Commercial Items form found at http://www.gsa.gov/forms/pdf_file and submit a proposal.
 All qualified responsible small business sources may submit a quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES. Quotations received without the completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 may be considered non-compliant. Beginning January 1, 2005, the FAR requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.
 ORCA also allows Government personnel to access your information online, thus eliminating the need for you to submit representations and certifications with each offer. To register in ORCA you will need an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company's ID and password into ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses.
 The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCA's homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov/help.aspx. Full text of FAR and DFARS provisions and clauses may be accessed at http://www.farsite.hill.af.mil/vffara.htm and http://farsite.hill.af.mil/VFDFARA.HTM, respectively.

Post Question Pending Government Response.<br /><br />***PLEASE REVIEW QUESTIONS BELOW FIRST BEFORE SUBMITTING YOUR COMPANY'S QUESTION TO PREVENT DUPLICATE QUESTION***&nbsp;<br /><br />Question 1A: The scope of work for this project calls for the abandonment of the existing water main and replacing it with NEW water main (PVC C900). Contractor is inquiring if a alternative method of construction by rehabilitating the existing water main by cured in place pipe would be approved. <br /><br />Question 1B: If your answer is to comply with the Invitation for Bid (IFB) requirements - Contractor(s) will assume that open cut installation is only method accepted at this time for a the installation for the design/build water main project.<br /><br />Government Response to Question 1A: Per Statement of Work (SOW) (Para 1.2) it is clear that&nbsp;"Existing water piping and associate pipe fittings, valves shall be abandoned in place." Cured&nbsp;in place pipe which utilizes existing water main is NOT acceptable method for this acquisition.<br /><br />Government Response to Question 1B: Comply with SOW Paragraph 3.1.2.5.<br /><br />2. Project Scope: The Contractor is responsible for conducting a survey of the areas where work will take place.<br />Question: How much of a survey do you expect? We can use area maps and aerials, pick up all Fire Hydrants, Valves, Manholes etc etc with GPS and provide a plan for water main construction. Or do you want a complete Topographic survey?<br />Government Response: You can use area maps and aerials, pick up all Fire Hydrants, Valves, Manholes etc etc with GPS and provide a plan for water main construction. No need of complete Topographic survey
<p>3. 1.1 Design: A design package shall be submitted at 65%.<br />Question: How much detail do you require at 65%?<br />Government Response: show service connection, cathodic protection, boring, asphalt/concrete pavement replacement (if any), fire hydrant connection, typical thrust block, locator wire detail etc..</p>
<p>4. 1.2 Water Line Replacement: Replace 8" and 6" Water Mains.<br />Question: Can the plans be plan view only? Or do you require Plan &amp; Profile?<br />Government Response: The design plans can be plan view but the as-built shall include plan and profile</p>

<p>All other terms and conditions remain unchanged and in full force and effect.</p>
<p>Notes:<br />This is the second solicitation to FY11 BAA announcement based off the previous announcement AFCECCBAA-11-001 dated November 2, 2010. If an Offeror would like to be reconsidered under this announcement, please re-submit a new or revised white paper as stated below.</p>
<p>Please review all AFCEEBAA-11-001 Complete Question and Answers (attached) before submitting a question to the Contracting Officer. <br /><br /><br />Synopsis/Announcement:<br />This solicitation constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE), Technical Division (TD), Technology Transfer Program under FAR 6.102(d)(2). This announcement seeks out proposals that demonstrate and validate innovative, sustainable, and cost-effective technologies and/or methodologies that will lead to accelerated closure of environmental sites across the Air Force, eliminate or reduce hazardous material use and environmental release, and serve the Air Force's future environmental needs. Validated technologies and methodologies must comply with all applicable regulatory requirements, policies and guidance in the Restoration, Compliance Restoration, Pollution Prevention, and Military Munitions Response Programs. This acquisition is not to test theoretical concepts or technologies and methodologies that currently exist solely in a laboratory research and development (R&amp;D) phase or that have already been tested and validated multiple times in the field (i.e. a service). The areas of need for this announcement are:<br /><br />1. Restoration Program:<br /><br />a. Emerging Contaminants: Proposals should include innovative treatment technologies such as applied in situ bioremediation, chemical oxidation, chemical reduction, or other innovative technologies that specifically address emerging contaminants. Emerging contaminants can be considered those chemicals currently on the Department of Defense Chemical and Material Risk Management Directorate's Emerging Contaminants Action and Watch lists, USEPA's Candidate Contaminant List, and other contaminants that have potential Air Force implications pending future regulations. Specific needs relate to emerging contaminant exposure pathways, emerging contaminant treatment technologies, and the assessment of Air Force-wide impacts from future, or changing regulations regarding the detection of emerging contaminants in soils and groundwater. Example emerging contaminants of interest include but are not limited to: 1,4-dioxane, perfluorinated compounds, and hexavalent chromium.<br /><br />b. Clorinated Pesticides: Proposals should include innovative in situ treatment technologies for surface/shallow soil systems that specifically address chlorinated pesticides. Example chlorinated pesticides include: chlordane, aldrin, and dieldrin.</p>
<p>2. Pollution Prevention Program:<br /><br />a. Air Quality: Proposals should identify new or innovative technologies or control methodologies which are expected to generate feasible but substantial reductions in air pollutants of concern. Typical proposals have focused on material substitutions, process modifications, control technologies, and equipment modifications or substitutions. Additionally, proposals may address monitoring or emission quantification methods in a manner which can reduce the frequency at which monitoring is required, or the level of AF response. Proposals should not be limited to traditional CAA criteria and hazardous air pollutants and should provide additional considerations for the reduction of greenhouse gases and emerging contaminants.<br /><br />b. Hazardous Materials: Proposals should identify opportunities to eliminate or reduce the release of hazardous chemicals or minimize the regulatory burden and cost associated with the use and life-cycle management of hazardous materials. Proposals should include quantifiable measurement for either reduced chemical use or release, achievement of Executive Order 13514 goals, and total process operational cost. Specific needs relate to chemical releases reported under EPCRA Toxic Release Inventory requirements and hazardous waste stream reduction opportunities. These include, but are not limited to the reduction of air emissions from coal during plating operations, the reduction in nitrate releases from wastewater treatment operations, the use of hazardous materials and the generation of waste during painting, depainting, and plating operations. Proposals involving Air Force Weapon Systems may be considered ONLY if compatible with existing technical order and specification requirements for targeted systems/component. The BAA process is not intended to otherwise replace technical qualification to weapon system specifications. Rather, for Air Force Weapon Systems, it is meant to transition qualified technologies for demonstration and validation to further quantify hazardous material reductions and process efficiencies.<br /><br />c. Water Quality: Proposals should identify new or innovative technologies for drinking water treatment / distribution, wastewater treatment / collection, and stormwater pollutant controls. Items of specific interest for military public water systems include early contaminant detection and isolation, disinfection optimization controls / methods, detection levels of emerging contaminants, point-of-use fluoridation, and emergency water supply technologies. For wastewater, technologies that use low energy and significantly reduced maintenance to recycle grey water for building landscape irrigation are needed. For stormwater, the Air Force is interested in proposals that use energy efficient low maintenance technologies to reuse stormwater from roofs, parking lots, runways and other impervious surfaces. Compliance approaches and techniques to satisfy the Energy Independence and Security Act Section 438 requirements that do not build retention and detention systems for both the project and federal property level.</p>
<p>Eligible Offeror/Applicants: This requirement is restricted to US - companies, academic institutions, non-profit institutions, and/or government agenciesonly. Foreign participants and/or individuals may participate as subcontractors to the extent that such participants comply with any necessary Non-Disclosure Agreements, Security Regulations, Export Control Laws, and other governing statutes applicable under the circumstances.Acquisition Overview: The BAA process includes two phases of submittals:</p>
<p>Phase I - submit a 2 page online form (white paper/pre-proposal) at <br />http://www.afcee.lackland.af.mil/contracting/baa</p>
<p>Phase II - if invited, submit a full proposal that details the technology, the demonstration, and validation approach, and the costs for the proposed effort.</p>
<p>Relevant forms, samples and guides are found on FedBizOps and the AFCEE BAA Website. Evaluation criteria for Phase I are included in the proposal instruction document provided in this announcement. The anticipated award of AFCEEBAA-11-002 is Fiscal Year 11, 4 Quarter.</p>
<p>How to Apply: All Phase I white papers/pre-proposals must be submitted as an online form and can be accessed through AFCEE's website (http://www.afcee.lackland.af.mil/contracting/baa.)

Phase I submittals received after 20 April 2011 will be handled according to the rules under FAR52.215-1(c)(3).</p>
<p>Evaluation/Notification: Phase I pre-proposals are evaluated by the Air Force's Technical Evaluation Board (TEB) using the selection criteria included with the proposal instructions. It is critical that proposals convey the requested information accurately and concisely to facilitate their review. Offerors whose proposals are judged innovative and that meet Air Force needs (as indicated in the Phase I evaluation criteria) are notified electronically via email to submit a proposal to Phase II (request for proposal); those not selected are notified accordingly. Offerors invited to submit a Phase II proposal are sent to key personnel contact the listed in Phase I pre-proposal along with a Request for Proposal (RFP) Package, Phase II instructions, how and when Phase II proposals are to be submitted to the Air Force in an electronic notification (sent to the Key Personnel Contact listed in Phase I) by which the Phase II proposals are to be submitted.

<p><br />PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>1a. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Local Communications Services. This factor pertains to switch and PBX sites only.</p>
<p>This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p><br />Factor 4 - Diversity.</p>
<p>This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound pictorial approach for diversity to include the methodology for accomplishing diversity.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>

<DESC>Questions and Answers submitted:<br><br>Q: The Lift Channel material thickness is listed as .130 but most Aluminum in this range is o.125 or 0.190 thick.  Would it be acceptable to use 0.190 thick lift plate material?<br><br>A: Material thickness at a minimum of .125 is acceptable and .190 is acceptable.<br><br>Q: The drawing is not specifying the weld requirements.  Will appropriate stitch welds be acceptable.<br><br>A: Stitch welds are acceptable. Welds are visible on pictures. All welds are to be .25 fillet.<br><br>Q: How are these ramps being used? <br><br>A: We use these ramps to get forklifts into and out of earth covered magazines at LEMC. On a large number of magazines the concrete apron outside the magazine door and the road are at different levels and a ramp is needed to get the forklift from road level to magazine level. This level is not the same at all magazines but the current design ramp is the operators preference. The magazine door is 48 inches wide. Most forklifts used are 44-46 inches wide.<br><br>Q: Where is the load located on the ramps in order to satisfy the 10,000lb load rating?<br><br>A: The forklifts used are electric lifts such as a CLARK TMX 25 that may weigh 4500-6000 pounds empty. Center of wheels varies but the current design works.                                     <br><br>Q: The ramps in the pictures are pretty beat up - do we want to replicate this design or can we make slight modifications? (We noticed the ends of the forklift pockets are crushing and some cross-member welds are cracking).<br><br>A: We want the ramps made in accordance with the drawings provided. The ramps in the pictures provided are nearly 6 years old and are used daily. We do have to make repairs occasionally and we do have a maintenance shop that performs the repairs as needed. This design is a second design made over 6 years ago.<br><br>Q: Do we have any weight restrictions for the ramps? <br><br>A: As per drawing 10,000 pounds capacity.<br><br>Q: Why was 1/2" diamond plate chosen? Can we vary the height of the ramps by<br>+/- 1/2" ? <br><br>A: The ramps on the drawings provided were designed by professional engineers at Letterkenny Army Depot Production Engineering Division. The ramps used prior to these ramps were looked at and improved to what we have now and what we are pleased with. Build as per drawing.<br><br>Q: How are the forklifts moving these? Are the ramps loaded when being moved by forklifts?<br><br>A: The forklifts move these ramps only when empty. The forklifts move the ramp section using the lifting channel. They are ramps that we use to get on to an earth covered magazine apron and provide an entry means for the fork lift. We transport the ramps in a steel enclosure. The ramps are loaded with a forklift using the lift channels shown on the drawings. The M1920 is moved by hand.<br><br>Response date and time remain unchanged (15 Apr 2011, 4:00 P.M. Eastern Daylight Time).<br>

$_______________<br /><br />NOTE PRE-BID/PRE_PROPOSAL CONFERENCE OPPORTUNITY CONTAINED HEREIN<br />+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br /></strong><br /><br /><strong>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENTS<br /><br />Background: The Fremont-Winema National Forests, Klamath Ranger District, is initiating a Vegetation Demonstration Project in the Lake of the Woods recreation area, specifically in the Camp McLoughlin Boy Scout Camp. The Camp McLoughlin Demonstration Project will address current forest health and insect and disease concerns within the recreation area. The services being solicited in this solicitation are to fall and remove large hazard trees and cleanup resulting debris from tops and damaged trees. </strong></p>
<p>Camp McLoughlin contains many physical improvements including, but not limited to, living structures, tent sites, eating and meeting structures, restrooms, docks, numerous outbuildings, and wood sheds. Electrical power is underground, as are waterlines. The area has a high concentration of danger trees. Since the proposed treatment takes place around structures and improvements as well, safety is a high concern. The following list displays some measures that need to be addressed in any submitted proposal:<br />&bull; Coordination of activities with the Forest Service and slated Camp Activities.<br />&bull; Adequate signage for operational areas.<br />&bull; Coordination in the temporary closing of roads, when necessary.<br />&bull; Methods of informing forest users, hikers, anglers, and any adjacent homeowners of impending work.</p>
<p><strong>SCOPE OF CONTRACT:</strong> The purpose of this Request for Proposal is to secure services for the cutting, limbing, bucking, slash cleanup, and hauling and decking of green-marked trees. The Contractor shall furnish all labor, equipment, supervision, transportation, supplies, and incidental to perform all work. This is a performance-based contract.</p>
<p><strong>LOCATION AND BOUNDARIES:</strong></p>
<p>&bull; Location: The project area can be reached by proceeding west on State Highway 140 from Klamath Falls, Oregon, to the junction of State Highway 140 and Forest Service Road (FSR) 3601, a distance of approximately 35 miles. Turn south onto FSR 3601 and continue for approximately &frac14; mile to Camp McLoughlin. Camp McLoughlin encompasses approximately 56 acres.<br />&bull; Boundaries: Boundaries are marked with blue timber sale contract boundary tags and yellow flagging. The corners of the boundary tags are painted with orange tracer paint dots on tags and boundary trees. There is an equipment exclusion zone (EEZ) around the lake and Dry Creek designated with white tags. The EEZ boundaries are approximately 25 feet from the unit boundaries.</p>
<p><strong>ACCESSIBILITY:</strong> The general areas of work can be reached by Forest Service roads that are accessible by standard pickup truck, weather permitting. <br />The Government assumes no obligations to do special road maintenance to keep roads open. In order to minimize soil erosion and damage to National Forest lands and roads, all roads are subject to closure during spring and fall breakup or whenever soil or weather conditions require.</p>
<p>At times spur roads shown on project maps may not be accessible by vehicle but show a previously known road to the work area. No vehicles will be permitted to operate off system roads without approval of the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Subgrade soil moisture on FS Road 3601 is a concern. Hauling on FS Road 3601 is only permissible if the subgrade is frozen or dry.</p>
<p>Contractor may plow FS Road 3601 to allow equipment to access the site,&nbsp;dependent on road conditions and&nbsp;prior&nbsp;Government approval.</p>
<p><strong>ITEM 1 REQUIREMENT:</strong> Cutting, Limbing,&nbsp;and Bucking of Green-Marked Trees.<br />The offeror shall base pricing on the cutting, limbing, and bucking of large hazard trees, and trees damaged during felling operations. There are approximately 50 green tracer paint-marked trees designated to be cut.<br />All trees shall be felled in such a manner as to minimize damage to existing standing trees, structures, and improvements. Some examples of possible ways to accomplish this include but are not limited to directional falling, jacking, crane use, climbing and chunking, and pulling down by cable.<br />Trees shall be limbed and bucked to preferred log lengths (provided at post-award conference). Stump heights shall not exceed 12 inches and all stumps shall be smooth and not have jagged edges. Fallen hazard trees and trees damaged during felling operations&nbsp;shall not obstruct camp trails or roads. <br />The cutting, limbing,&nbsp;and bucking of these green-marked trees consist of all activities normally associated with cutting and bucking of trees of this type.</p>
<p>Estimated start work date for this item is April 25, 2011. All work shall be completed by June 5, 2011 for this item.</p>
<p><strong>ITEM 2 REQUIREMENT:</strong> Apply Sporax to White Fir and Shasta Red Fir stumps.<br />Apply sporax to all White Fir and Shasta Red Fir that were felled in Item 1 and&nbsp;are 18 inches or larger in diameter at the stump. There are approximately 50 trees of these species. Apply enough sporax to lightly cover stump surface including exposed wood surfaces on all sides (approximately 1 pound borax per 50 square feet of exposed wood surface). Apply the material to all exposed wood surfaces. Stumps shall be level and have no splinters. The prescribed method of application is to sprinkle the material salt shaker-style on the freshly cut stump surface. Treatment shall be done as soon after tree felling as practical, preferably within 1 or 2 hours, but by no later than the end of the work day in which the tree was felled.<br /><br />The application of Sporax consists of all activities normally associated with Sporax application to tree stumps of this type.<br /><br />Estimated start work date for this item is April 25, 2011. All work shall be completed by June 5, 2011, for this item.<br /><br /><strong>ITEM 3 REQUIREMENTS:</strong> Cleanup of created slash <br />Tops of felled, hazard trees and damaged trees from Item 1&nbsp;down to three inches in diameter on the large end shall be bucked into 16-inch firewood lengths and left on site. Slash material created from the operations under this contract that is less than 3 inches in diameter on the large end shall be placed in piles on the site.&nbsp;Slash that is to be piled shall be piled in such a manner as to facilitate easy access for future retrieval and chipping. No chipping is to take place under this contract. <br />The treatment of slash and debris from the tops of felled and damaged trees consists of all activities normally associated with slash treatment of this type.</p>
<p>This portion of the contract requires the Contractor to have a valid State Farm/Forest Labor License and a valid DOL Farm Labor Contractor Certificate. Contractor may also claim to be exempt from these licenses but must state the specific reason(s) for exemption.</p>
<p>Estimated start work date for this item is April 25, 2011. All work shall be completed by June 5, 2011.</p>
<p><strong>ITEM 4 REQUIREMENTS</strong>: Removal of Green-Marked Trees to Pearce Point<br />Logs shall be skidded to landings on designated skid trails with minimal damage to existing trees.</p>
<p>Logs shall be hauled to Pearce Point and shall be consolidated and placed in a designated area.</p>
<p>The cutting and removal of these green-marked trees consist of all activities normally associated with cutting and removal of trees of this type.</p>
<p>Estimated start work date is dependent on weather conditions. Work can take place on this item if the ground is either frozen hard and the subgrade on paved roads to be travelled by logging trucks remains frozen; OR work can also take place later in the season, when the ground is dry, paved road conditions are suitable for hauling logs, and the Boy Scout Camp Schedule allows. It is estimated that late August 2011 may afford an operating window. Actual start work date will be negotiated with Contractor. Estimated contract time is 5 calendar days. All work shall be completed on this item by September 1, 2011.</p>

A worker who moves from one seasonal activity to another is employed on a seasonal basis even though the worker may continue to be employed during a major portion of the year. Migrant workers are required to be absent overnight from their permanent place of residence. Seasonal workers are not required to be absent overnight from their permanent place of residence. Members of the contractor's immediate family are not considered to be either migrant or seasonal workers.

Question 1 -

See 3.2 Performance Objectives: "Partnerships (with government andnon-governmental organizations, exporters, importers, and otherstakeholders) ensuring a long-term commitment and comprehensiveapproach to support children and adults in weaving communities to bemeasured by number of partnerships created with above mentionedinstitutions."
b.  A Transition Plan is mentioned in both the Deliverables Summary and Performance Requirement Summary charts; I'm assuming that this refers to a transition from Government funding to other forms of funding?  Yes
c.  Can I assume the hiring and training of local Afghan staff within 0 - 3 months mentioned in 3.6 does not suggest that the organization must be fully staffed in that time?  Yes, correct. Question 2 - 
We anticipate there will up-front mobilization costs as we develop an Afghan effort.  Will this fit into the normal payment structure and if so how do we best articulate this need?
Commercial Advanced Payments are not authorized for this requirement; however, in lieu of payment upon completion of the contract, Commercial Interim Payments are allowable and suggested by the Government for this acquisition.  Interim payments can be made upon the Government's receipt of contractor invoices or the payments can correspond to the completion of measurable milestones or deliverables.
Contractors shall acknowledge receipt of Amendment 1 in their quote's cover letter by the hour and date specified in the solicitation.  Failure to acknowledge receipt of Amendment 1 may result in the rejection of your quote.
The response date to this RFQ remains unchanged, April 15, 2011 (on or before 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time).

<p>QUOTATION EVALUATION:</p>
<p>Evaluation Factors</p>
<p>Award shall be made to the offeror whose quotation offers the best value to the Government price and other factors considered. The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability 2) Experience 3) Past Performance, and 4) Price. All non-price factors, when combined, are approximately equally important to price.</p>
<p>Technical Capability: No prototypes, demonstration models, used or refurbished instruments will be considered. Evaluation of technical capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation. NIST will evaluate whether the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds all minimum requirements. Quotations that do not demonstrate the proposed equipment meets all requirements will not be considered further for award. If an offeror does not indicate whether its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate that their proposed equipment exceeds NIST's requirements. NIST will give stronger preference to offerors whose quoted equipment exceeds minimum requirements 1e.</p>
<p>Experience: NIST will evaluate the extent of the offeror's experience providing similar equipment. Manufacturer of quoted instrument shall have at least three (3) years of experience in manufacturing Atomic Force Microscopes. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate they have experience delivering the same equipment they are proposing for the current requirement.</p>
<p>Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years. In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references. The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable. The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offeror's past performance. The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.</p>
<p>Price: The Government will evaluate price for reasonableness. Price will be evaluated based on the cumulative total of all the line item prices, IAW FAR 52.217-5.</p>
<p>Experience, Past Performance, and Price shall not be evaluated on quotes that are determined technically unacceptable under the Technical Capability Evaluation factor.</p>

<DESC>*** CONTRACTOR QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ARE ATTACHED ***<br><br>1.  CONTRACT INFORMATION:  These contracts are being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6.  Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work.  See Numbered Note 24 for general information on the A-E selection process.  The services will consist of core drilling and geotechnical subsurface sampling via continuous and/or standard SPT techniques, large diameter coring within rock units, sonic drilling, vibracoring, field and in situ testing, geophysical site investigations, field and laboratory testing of materials (including construction Q/A testing), chemical analytical laboratory testing, site preparation, and establishing coordinate locations for projects located within the Florida boundaries of the Jacksonville District, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Caribbean area.  The primary purpose of these proposed contracts are to provide services for projects located within the geographic boundaries of the Jacksonville District.  Secondarily, these contracts may be used to provide services within the geographic boundaries of the other U.S. Army Corps of Engineers districts within the South Atlantic Division.  The contractor will have the right to refuse orders for services to be performed outside the geographic boundaries of the Jacksonville District.  North American Industrial Classification System code is 541330, which has a size standard of $4,500,000 in average annual receipts.  It is the intent of the Government to initially award two (2) contracts, one (1) contract from the 8(a) set aside and one (1) Small Business set aside.  However, if there are no highly qualified 8(a) small businesses, the award will be made from the highly qualified small business firms.  No one firm will receive more than one award as a result of this solicitation.  Only firms considered highly qualified will be awarded a contract.  Indefinite delivery contracts will be negotiated and awarded from this solicitation with subsequent work issued by negotiated firm-fixed-price task orders.  This announcement will result in up to two (2) awards.  Criteria used in allocating task orders among contracts include performance and quality of deliverables under current task orders, current capacity to accomplish the order in the required time, specialized experience, equitable distribution of the work among the contractors, and other relevant factors.  The contracts will be for a period of one year from date of award, with options to extend for four additional years; not to exceed a total of five years.  While the estimated dollar amount per year is $1,000,000.00, the actual obligation per year may be greater than or less than the $1,000,000.00.  Maximum order limit is $5,000,000 for the life of the contract, including options.  The Director of Defense Procurement has issued a final rule requiring that contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before receiving a contract from any activity of the Department of Defense.  The rule authorizes contracting officers to reject offers from contractors that have not registered.  For more information, visit the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov.  You must also be registered in Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in order to receive an award from this solicitation.  The ORCA website is located at http://orca.bpn.gov.  <br><br>Contractors submitting an offer as a joint venture must provide a written copy of the joint venture agreement with the initial proposal. The joint venture agreement must be signed by all parties and will be subject to review by Office of Counsel. If an 8(a) small business joint venture is contemplated, approval by the Small Business Administration will be required and the joint venture agreement must comply with the applicable requirements of 13 CFR Part 124.  The joint venture must be registered in CCR as a joint venture in order for an award to be made. In addition, all documents and future documents (task orders, etc.) must be signed by all parties.<br><br>Your attention is directed to FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting which states in part: At least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern.<br><br><br>2.

<DESC>*** CONTRACTOR QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ARE ATTACHED ***<br><br>1.  CONTRACT INFORMATION:  These contracts are being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6.  Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work.  See Numbered Note 24 for general information on the A-E selection process.  The services will consist of core drilling and geotechnical subsurface sampling via continuous and/or standard SPT techniques, large diameter coring within rock units, sonic drilling, vibracoring, field and in situ testing, geophysical site investigations, field and laboratory testing of materials (including construction Q/A testing), chemical analytical laboratory testing, site preparation, and establishing coordinate locations for projects located within the Florida boundaries of the Jacksonville District, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Caribbean area.  The primary purpose of these proposed contracts are to provide services for projects located within the geographic boundaries of the Jacksonville District.  Secondarily, these contracts may be used to provide services within the geographic boundaries of the other U.S. Army Corps of Engineers districts within the South Atlantic Division.  The contractor will have the right to refuse orders for services to be performed outside the geographic boundaries of the Jacksonville District.  North American Industrial Classification System code is 541330, which has a size standard of $4,500,000 in average annual receipts.  It is the intent of the Government to initially award two (2) contracts, one (1) contract from the 8(a) set aside and one (1) Small Business set aside.  However, if there are no highly qualified 8(a) small businesses, the award will be made from the highly qualified small business firms.  No one firm will receive more than one award as a result of this solicitation.  Only firms considered highly qualified will be awarded a contract.  Indefinite delivery contracts will be negotiated and awarded from this solicitation with subsequent work issued by negotiated firm-fixed-price task orders.  This announcement will result in up to two (2) awards.  Criteria used in allocating task orders among contracts include performance and quality of deliverables under current task orders, current capacity to accomplish the order in the required time, specialized experience, equitable distribution of the work among the contractors, and other relevant factors.  The contracts will be for a period of one year from date of award, with options to extend for four additional years; not to exceed a total of five years.  While the estimated dollar amount per year is $1,000,000.00, the actual obligation per year may be greater than or less than the $1,000,000.00.  Maximum order limit is $5,000,000 for the life of the contract, including options.  The Director of Defense Procurement has issued a final rule requiring that contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before receiving a contract from any activity of the Department of Defense.  The rule authorizes contracting officers to reject offers from contractors that have not registered.  For more information, visit the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov.  You must also be registered in Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in order to receive an award from this solicitation.  The ORCA website is located at http://orca.bpn.gov.  <br><br>Contractors submitting an offer as a joint venture must provide a written copy of the joint venture agreement with the initial proposal. The joint venture agreement must be signed by all parties and will be subject to review by Office of Counsel. If an 8(a) small business joint venture is contemplated, approval by the Small Business Administration will be required and the joint venture agreement must comply with the applicable requirements of 13 CFR Part 124.  The joint venture must be registered in CCR as a joint venture in order for an award to be made. In addition, all documents and future documents (task orders, etc.) must be signed by all parties.<br><br>Your attention is directed to FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting which states in part: At least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern.<br><br><br>2.  PROJECT INFORMATION:  Services will include core drilling and geotechnical subsurface sampling via continuous and/or standard SPT techniques, large diameter coring within rock units, sonic drilling, vibracoring, field and in situ testing, geophysical site investigations, field and laboratory testing of materials (including construction Q/A testing), chemical analytical laboratory testing, site preparation, and establishing coordinate locations.

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>OFDA's Office of the Director assists the Director and Deputy Director with tracking trends and policy developments in the humanitarian assistance field, recommends strategies for action, and maintains global relationships with USAID implementing partners and other donors. OFDA's Humanitarian Policy and Multi-lateral Affairs team comprises senior Humanitarian Advisors located in Brussels, Geneva, New York and Rome coordinated by OFDA/Washington's Office of the Director. Currently, OFDA operates a small office in Geneva, Switzerland which is responsible for working closely with United Nations (UN) agencies, International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) / International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), nongovernmental organization (NGO) fora, and donors on a range of humanitarian issues. As one of the critical "humanitarian capitals of the world," Geneva is the venue for key discussions on policy issues directly related to OFDA's activities, such as reform of the international humanitarian system, best practices in financing humanitarian programs and disaster management as well as for donor initiatives on improving the effectiveness of humanitarian aid. USAID/OFDA is seen within the Geneva-based international community as a leader in the field of humanitarian affairs based on its expertise in policy and delivery of assistance, an extensive field network, large humanitarian budget, and its engagement with a wide variety of international and local partners.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>USAID/OFDA requires the services of a Humanitarian Advisor based at USUN in Geneva, Switzerland to provide support to USUN and ensure that USAID objectives for disaster assistance, strategic reporting on humanitarian issues, and situational analysis on humanitarian policy issues are met and coordinated closely.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The Humanitarian Advisor serves as a key source of information on humanitarian issues and humanitarian policy for USUN Geneva. He/She will help plan USUN strategies and responses to humanitarian crises, actively lobby members of UN delegations on U.S. positions on humanitarian issues, provide effective liaison with the UN offices in Geneva, and anticipate and prepare documents and briefing memos on humanitarian issues for important meetings and events. The Humanitarian Advisor will also raise critical issues with the UN on behalf of OFDA, DCHA offices and other U.S. Government (USG) agencies and must have the ability to multi-task. The assignment involves providing expert analytical and advisory support on humanitarian issues for the planning, development and execution of U.S. foreign policy within a broad and complex geographic or functional specialty area. The work requires applying a rigorous analytical approach to data and the Humanitarian Advisor will receive general guidance but will be expected to execute independent judgment and analysis.</p>
<p>Contacts will be within the USG, as well as personnel at U.S. posts worldwide, senior analysts and officials in UN and other agencies, experts, and representatives of non-governmental organizations. The role requires significant interaction with foreign delegates, demanding strong diplomatic and communication skills to accurately represent U.S. positions in a complex multilateral setting, based on guidance from Washington. Contacts occur in a wide variety of planned and unplanned, formal and informal settings, including open meetings, conferences, and negotiating sessions, where the Humanitarian Advisor may be called upon to explain and defend U.S. positions on humanitarian issues.</p>
<p>The position requires extensive experience with and a thorough understanding of the international humanitarian assistance environment, operations, related policies, regulations, and inter-relationships between the USG, donor and other international organizations.</p>
<p>The Humanitarian Advisor will work out of the USUN Mission in Geneva, Switzerland and will report to OFDA's Senior Humanitarian Policy Advisor in OFDA/Washington as well as the Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM) in Geneva. The Humanitarian Advisor will serve as USAID's principal in-country point of contact for humanitarian issues in Geneva. The Humanitarian Advisor's duties and responsibilities will include the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Provide leadership for the identification, research, analysis and development of recommendations on all issues and matters relating to humanitarian affairs and anticipate the need for such policy analysis.<br />&bull; Represent USAID at donor meetings covering a broad range of humanitarian issues and provide DCHA Bureau with analysis and guidance on relations with the UN system.<br />&bull; As part of an interagency team working on humanitarian issues in the Office of Refugees and Migration Affairs (RMA) Section at USUN Geneva, interact with State Department colleagues on developing strategies and policies toward UN agencies and issues.<br />&bull; Anticipate the needs at USUN Geneva regarding developments in the areas of humanitarian affairs and prepare analyses, briefings, documents and meetings as required.<br />&bull; Attend various UN, USUN, UN Office of Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance (OCHA) Donor Support Group (ODSG), Humanitarian Liaison Working Group (HLWG) and other meetings and provide authoritative information and views to formulate humanitarian policies and coordinate strategies on policy issues.<br />&bull; Initiate and maintain strong working relationships with other diplomatic missions in order to promote humanitarian principles and coordinate disaster response activities.<br />&bull; Develop and maintain cooperative working relationships with other USUN components and relevant USG offices and serve as an expert point of contact for these groups in the area of humanitarian affairs. Typical contacts are the Chief of Mission, high level officials of the UN agencies and senior representatives of foreign governments. The incumbent will influence policy.<br />&bull; Represent DCHA on specific humanitarian issues of concern with UN agencies in Geneva and convey demarche messages as needed.<br />&bull; Represent USAID at meetings with the UN, international organizations, and other donors and other conferences sponsored by members of the international community, and provides guidance and advice on USG positions, negotiating strategies, and, in consultation with USAID/Washington, conducts negotiations with the donor community and make recommendations to the appropriate officials in USAID.<br />&bull; Work with counterparts in other donor organizations in Geneva at the most senior levels, particularly those represented in the Humanitarian Liaison Working Group, to exchange information, establish meetings on specific donor issues, solicit publications, and collect information on training opportunities; coordinate these activities with relevant USAID officers.<br />&bull; Disseminate relevant USAID/OFDA guidelines and information and act as OFDA's general point of contact for international donor appeals and other documentation from the International Committee of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, the International Federation of the Red Cross and other agencies based in Geneva. Respond to inquiries and be familiar with their operational procedures.<br />&bull; Advise USAID/OFDA staff on issues regarding donations and requests for USG support and information sharing from private and public interest groups, including those formed on an ad hoc basis during disaster assistance operations.<br />&bull; Serve on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) and represent USAID in field visits and assessments as appropriate and when requested by USAID/OFDA.<br />&bull; Act as a liaison between the USUN Mission and other offices within DCHA including the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) on food security and maternal child health nutrition issues for emergency, non-emergency and developmental relief activities.<br />&bull; Provide informational updates and analysis as necessary on activities undertaken by WHO, OCHA, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), and ICRC on food security issues which have a humanitarian focus that will drive policy debates in the USG interagency arena.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Humanitarian Advisor at USUN is part of the Humanitarian Policy and Multi-lateral Affairs Team in the Office of the OFDA Director and will report to the OFDA/Washington Senior Humanitarian Policy Advisor. The Geneva-based position will also concurrently report to the Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM) and be located in the RMA Section at USUN. For many activities, the Humanitarian Advisor will also coordinate closely with USG personnel in Geneva. The Humanitarian Advisor does not have the authority to commit OFDA resources without approval from OFDA/Washington.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />Supervisory controls will concurrently be through USAID/Washington and the USUN Mission, but the Humanitarian Advisor is expected to act independently with minimal direction and will have wide latitude for the exercise of independent judgment. The OFDA/OD Senior Humanitarian Policy Advisor in Washington will provide direction in terms of policy guidance, program goals and objectives to ensure consistent guidance on humanitarian issues across other USUN Missions.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC><p>PBGC: Financial Advisory Services Support: Transactions<br />Agency: Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation</p>
<p>Synopsis</p>
<p>The PBGC's Department of Insurance Supervision and Compliance (DISC) requires the services of financial advisory firms to support DISC in transactions involving pension plan sponsors and their controlled group members. The overall goal of the procurement is to provide PBGC with the following:</p>
<p>1. A reasonably-priced, flexible contract to acquire commercial financial advisory services.<br /><br />2. High-quality financial advisory services.<br /><br />3. The ability to issue task orders and begin work on those task orders in a very short time frame. <br /><br />4. Access to financial advisory services during a base year and four option years (for a maximum of five possible years).</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to obtain feedback from interested firms as to the various pricing structures used in the financial advisory community.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>PBGC currently has multiple-award-schedule, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contracts (IDIQ) with seven firms to provide financial advisory services to DISC. Those contracts currently expire on 30 September 2011. Going forward, PBGC is considering replacing those contracts with two sets of IDIQ contracts, one for services in support of bankruptcy &amp; restructuring activities and one in support of transactions. These contracts will be task order contracts, meaning that the firms selected for the new IDIQ contracts will then compete for awards of specific task orders whenever DISC determines it needs outside financial advisory services. Both sets of contracts are likely to be performance based, and will possibly provide incentives for selected firms to obtain certain results in either the bankruptcy/restructuring activities or the transactions. The same firms will be eligible to compete and receive awards for both the Bankruptcy/Restructuring and Transaction Support IDIQ contracts.</p>
<p><br />Proposed Structure: Transaction Support<br /><br />The IDIQ contracts PBGC proposes to award will contain general requirements that each firm must be prepared to meet. Specific activities that the firms will have to undertake for each transaction will be set out in each task order. Because each transaction is unique, it is difficult to state in advance and with particularity what deliverable items the selected firm would have to provide in each task order. Thus a pricing arrangement providing for payment by deliverable item is probably not practical. Additionally, transactions are typically fixed in time and relatively short in duration, so PBGC is considering a flat rate for the entire transaction. PBGC is also considering ways in which to provide a monetary incentive arrangement based on targets that the firm would strive to meet.</p>
<p>Request</p>
<p>PBGC is aware that financial advisory firms use a variety of pricing structures in commercial activities and that those structures differ according to the types of firms involved (e.g., investment banks, financial consulting firms, and accounting firms). PBGC therefore requests that interested firms review the attached proposed Performance Work Statement for transactions and provide PBGC with feedback. Specifically, we would like to know (1) whether your firm would be interested in bidding on a contract for these services; (2) what types of pricing structures you have seen and used in similar situations;&nbsp;(3) what ideas you have as to how PBGC might best structure the pricing component its procurement for transactional support; provide any other comments/suggestions related to the Performance Work Statements; the proposed evaluation criteria; and&nbsp;any other&nbsp;part of the draft Request for Proposal&nbsp;(See attached Draft Request for Proposal).</p>
<p>Responses</p>
<p>Send your responses to Fiorela Kvalevog, contracts specialist, at Kvalevog.fiorela@pbgc.gov. We ask that you submit your responses no later than 2:00pmEaster Standard Time on April 18, 2011.</p>
<p><br />Disclaimer and Important Information</p>
<p>This Request for Information is for informational purposes only. Please be aware that any information posted to this notice is only a draft version.</p>
<p>The official solicitation and any amendments will be available through the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website, www.fbo.gov. It is anticipated that the solicitation will be issued on or about May 6, 2011. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO website to ensure that the most up to date information is accessed. Paper copies of the solicitation and any amendments will not be distributed. Upon issuance of the solicitation, there will be an identified question and answer period.</p>
<p>Further inquiries regarding this solicitation must be sent to Fiorela Kvalevog, Contract Specialist at kvalevog.fiorela@pbgc.gov.</p>
<p>The anticipated IDIQ contract has a period of performance of a base period of twelve (12) months and Four (4) option periods consisting of twelve (12) months each. In order to be eligible for award, all responsible sources must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. Contractors may register online at the website, www.ccr.gov.</p>

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)
<p>PBGC: Financial Advisory Services Support: Bankruptcy &amp; Restructuring Support<br />Agency: Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation</p>
<p>Synopsis</p>
<p>The PBGC's Department of Insurance Supervision and Compliance (DISC) requires the services of financial advisory firms to support DISC in complex bankruptcy and restructuring cases involving pension plan sponsors and their controlled group members. The overall goal of the procurement is to provide PBGC with the following:</p>
<p>1. A reasonably-priced, flexible contract to acquire commercial financial advisory services.<br /><br />2. High-quality financial advisory services.<br /><br />3. The ability to issue task orders and begin work on those task orders in a very short time frame. <br /><br />4. Access to financial advisory services during a base year and four option years (for a maximum of five possible years).</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to obtain feedback from interested firms as to the various pricing structures used in the financial advisory community.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>PBGC currently has multiple-award-schedule, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contracts (IDIQ) with seven firms to provide financial advisory services to DISC. Those contracts currently expire on 30 September 2011. Going forward, PBGC is considering replacing those contracts with two sets of IDIQ contracts, one for services in support of bankruptcy &amp; restructuring activities and one in support of transactions. These contracts will be task order contracts, meaning that the firms selected for the new IDIQ contracts will then compete for awards of specific task orders whenever DISC determines it needs outside financial advisory services.

The same firms will be eligible to compete and receive awards for both the Bankruptcy/Restructuring and Transaction Support IDIQ contracts.</p>
<p>Proposed Structure: Bankruptcy &amp; Restructuring</p>
<p>The IDIQ contracts PBGC proposes to award will contain general requirements that each firm must be prepared to meet. Specific activities that the firms will have to undertake for each bankruptcy/restructuring will be set out in each task order. Because each bankruptcy/restructuring activity is unique, it is difficult to state in advance and with particularity what deliverable items the selected firm would have to provide in each task order. Thus a pricing arrangement providing for payment by deliverable item is probably not practical. Additionally, bankruptcy and restructuring activities tend to be somewhat open-ended in time, so PBGC is considering a pricing structure in which periodic payments would be made to the selected firm to provide for cash flow. PBGC is also considering ways in which to provide a monetary incentive arrangement based on targets that the firm would strive to meet.</p>
<p><br />Request</p>

Specifically, we would like to know (1) whether your firm would be interested in bidding on a contract for these services; (2) what types of pricing structures you have seen and used in similar situations; (3) what ideas you have as to how PBGC might best structure the pricing component its procurement for bankruptcy/restructuring and transactional support;and &nbsp;(4) provide any other comments/suggestions related to the Performance Work Statement, the proposed evaluation criteria or any other part of the Draft Request for Proposal (see attached Draft request for proposal).</p>

<DESC><p>This Sources Sought Notice (SS) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) for the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB).</p>
<p>The purpose of this SS is to identify qualified small business concerns [including Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB), Woman-owned Small Businesses (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Small Businesses, Veteran-owned Small Businesses (VOSB), and Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB)] that are interested in and capable of providing the below medical image sharing services for a patient-centered and healthcare providers facilitated medical image sharing system.</p>
<p>The NHLBI does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted. As a result of this Sources Sought Notice, the NHLBI may issue a Request for Proposal (RFP).</p>
<p>THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NHLBI shall arise as a result of a response to this Sources Sought Notice or the NHLBI's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.</p>
<p>The NHLBI is seeking capability statements from all eligible small business concerns [particularly Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB), Woman-owned Small Businesses (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Small Businesses, Veteran-owned Small Businesses (VOSB), and Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB)] under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541512 with a business size standard of $25.0 Million.</p>
<p>Based on the responses received from this Sources Sought Notice, the proposed acquisition may be solicited as a Total Small Business Set-Aside. All eligible small business concerns responding to this Sources Sought Notice must have the capabilities to provide the below services at time of award.</p>
<p>Interested parties are expected to review this notice to familiarize themselves with the requirements of this project; failure to do so will be at the firm's own risk.</p>
<p><strong>Statement of Work</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background</span></p>
<p>Medical images play an important role in quality patient care. Many diagnostic and treatment decisions are heavily dependent on image data (including images and reports). In today's medical environment, most patients have multiple encounters at geographically separate locations, with image data dispersed across a number of sites. The inability to share medical image data across separate organizations results in significant problems: inadequate patient care due to absent data, delayed care due to ineffective image distribution, and significant increases in cost and potential health risk due to duplicate image acquisition.</p>
<p>Sharing image data through a network for image exchange will lead to better informed medical decisions, better analysis of medical outcomes, reductions in unnecessary expenses, and improvements in the quality and safety of patient care. The value of patient care will be enhanced when systems at different locations are capable of managing, exchanging and displaying medical information in its many forms, including images. In addition, an optimal solution could dramatically reduce overhead on the health care infrastructure.</p>
<p>NIBIB has funded several projects over the last few years to establish basic infrastructures to promote the exchange of medical images across broad geographic areas within the United States.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose</span></p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to develop a patient-centered and healthcare providers facilitated medical image sharing system where patients can directly control who has access to their images for effective and safe image sharing among radiologists and clinicians across organizational boundaries. NIBIB encourages a standards-based approach to leverage existing standards and frameworks that have been developed in the public sector, to establish an electronic "patient-controlled" method that will provide an efficient mechanism for managing health information and provider access. NIBIB requires the system to address many critical factors in medical image sharing (e.g. security, identity, privacy and confidentiality, consent and permissions, bandwidth, ease of use, etc.).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Technical Requirements</span></p>
<p>To be able to qualify for this contract, offerors must demonstrate that they have the capability to develop a medical image sharing system with which patients can control how and when to share their medical images. The offerors must also demonstrate, by themselves or by collaboration, the broad expertise, such as medical imagers, radiologists, physical scientists, engineers and informatics specialists needed for this work. The offerors must also demonstrate the capability of collaboration with academic institutions and industries that provide multiple imaging modalities and EHR solutions. Finally, the offerors must provide plans and measures to ensure that the solution they developed under this contract will be readily disseminated and adopted by industry partners. A sustainability model shall be integrated into the overall image sharing plan. <br />Specifically, the offerors shall:</p>
<p>&bull;Develop a program plan and project management process. A program plan will provide a detailed description of the activities for the entire contractual period. The activities shall be presented in a time-oriented sequence. For clarity and brevity, one-page charts shall be utilized whenever possible. The program plan shall include:</p>
<p>o Tasks to be accomplished<br />o Methods and timelines for achieving the tasks <br />o Milestones, deliverables, and timelines<br />o Allocation of resources, costs, hours, and personnel</p>
<p>&bull;Establish a 5-9 member advisory board to provide direction of the project and to evaluate and recommend the use cases for development. The advisory board shall include expertise in medical imaging, radiology, primary care, physics, engineering, and informatics from academic institutions, and/or industrial vendors.</p>
<p>&bull;Establish a minimum of 5 regional image-sharing sites across the United States, that are linked through a shared access to a patient-centered, web-based personal health record system. Each regional network will maintain knowledge of the exams made available by each participating radiology center (e.g. hospitals, imaging centers, etc.).</p>
<p>&bull;Propose a solution that is easily scalable to provide a generic model for image sharing for all patients and all institutions in the United States. The proposed solution shall be flexible in order to accommodate the needs of small clinics and major medical centers.</p>
<p>&bull;Develop appropriate use cases for the image sharing system based on real world scenarios of image examination workflows in the health care environment. The use cases must address unmet needs or technical challenges.</p>
<p>&bull;Implement the image sharing use cases or extend an existing institutionalized image sharing system.</p>
<p>&bull;Develop an image sharing system that could serve as a standards-based reference framework for clinical decision support, data mining, quality assurance (QA), and structured reporting capability. The reference framework should provide standards-based approaches to enable interoperability of clinical information and image data. The reference framework should be easily adopted by industry. The standards and specifications include, but not limit to:</p>
<p>o HL7<br />o IHE, XDS, etc.<br />o HIE<br />o HITSP<br />o NHIN</p>
<p>&bull;Leverage the radiology ontologies, standard vocabularies, and structured radiology report whenever possible and appropriate. The ontology and standard vocabularies include, but not limit to:</p>
<p>o RadLex<br />o SNOMED-CT<br />o LOINC</p>
<p>&bull;Develop a partnership and take concrete steps with industry and the community to facilitate the adoption of the solution developed under this contract, as a reference for interoperability.</p>
<p>&bull;Explore economic schemes of image exchange to develop a sustainability model for this activity.</p>
<p>&bull;Extend the current system to resolve remaining issues in policy, safety, and security to enable the secure but transparent exchange of imaging exams throughout the healthcare systems.</p>
<p>&bull;Develop an information security plan according to FISMA which should be approved by institutional IRB.</p>
<p>&bull;Develop flexible end user preferences and permissions for patients so that they can easily control when, who, and what to share. For example, patients should be able to select individual images or report for sharing. Patient should also be able to cancel the permission to share an image or put a time limit on a shared image.</p>
<p>At the end of the two year base period of performance, the offerors must:</p>
<p>&bull;Demonstrate that the image sharing system that has been developed is able to exchange and import imaging exams into and from systems across institutional boundaries in an intuitive and easy process.</p>
<p>&bull;Demonstrate consumer-based access to imaging exams through integration of Personal Health Records (PHRs), with the above system in a secure fashion, recognizing HIPAA requirements.</p>
<p>&bull;Demonstrate that internet-based imaging exchange is an extensible model that includes the numerous venues of standard clinical care as well as in the research environment.</p>
<p>If an option is exercised by the end of year two during the contract, the offerors shall conduct a limited and controlled study to evaluate the patient-controlled medical image sharing system for:</p>
<p>&bull;The efficiency and security of patient-controlled image sharing.</p>
<p>&bull;The reduction of the time and cost for sharing and transferring longitudinal records among regional networks.</p>
<p>&bull;The reduction of the time and cost for selecting images and exporting them to clinical studies.</p>
<p>&bull;The benefits of a patient-controlled medical image sharing network to patients, physicians and researchers.</p>
<p>The period of performance is estimated to be for one (1) two year base period with one (1) two year option period.</p>
<p>Before the contract ends, the offerors shall make every effort to disseminate the image sharing system to the public through conferences, public web sites, etc. The programming code of the image sharing system that is developed under this contract should be freely and publicly accessible to the general public.</p>
<p>Interested parties should submit a tailored capability statement for this requirement, not to exceed 20 pages (including all attachments, resumes, charts, etc.) presented in single-spaced and using 12-point font size minimum that clearly details the ability to perform the aspects of the notice described above. All proprietary information should be marked as such. Statements should also include an indication of current certified small business status; this indication should be clearly marked on the first page of your capability statement (preferably placed under the eligible small business concern's name and address). Responses will be reviewed only by NIH personnel and will be held in a confidential manner.</p>
<p>All capability statements sent in response to this Sources Sought Notice must be submitted electronically (via e-mail) to Ms. Rieka Plugge, Contract Specialist, at rieka.plugge@nih.gov and Mr. Aaron Blackshire, Contracting Officer, at aaron.blackshire@nih.gov in either MS Word or Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF), by April 21, 2011, 7:30 AM, EST.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
<p>Upon the basis of the following justification, I, as Contracting Officer, hereby approve the use of other than full and open competition of the proposed contractual action pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION</p>
<p>1. REQUIRING AGENCY AND CONTRACTING OFFICE: <br />United States Africa Command/ C4 Systems <br /><br />Contracting Activity:<br />DITCO-Europe/PL512 <br /><br /><br />2. NATURE/DESCRIPTION OF ACTION(S): United States Africa Command (USAFRICOM)/ Command, Control, Communications and Computers (C4S) Directorate has a requirement to solicit, negotiate, and award a contract or purchase order as a sole source through CODAN US Inc for the purchase of High Frequency (HF) equipment items listed as per the attached. 90 days after receipt of order, the High Frequency radio equipment must be delivered with export licenses, operators must be trained, and the High Frequency radio network must be operational.</p>
<p>CODAN US Inc, the sole US subsidiary of the CODAN Limited group of companies, currently manufactures and supplies High Frequency radio systems to the United States Government (USG) through Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and General Services Administration (GSA). Countries and programs include Afghanistan, Iraq and supply to Central Asia (Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan) through the Department of State. CODAN has also supplied High Frequency radios to many countries throughout Africa. These countries include Algeria, Angola, Botswana, Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia. In addition, CODAN has also provided High Frequency radios to the African Union (AU) for peacekeeping forces and supplied over 150 High Frequency radios in 2006 to the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) to support the AU's peacekeeping mission in Darfur. CODAN provides service and support throughout the world via a network of dealers, distributors and agents. CODAN radio products are used in approximately 40 countries in Africa, as well as international entities in Africa, such as the African Union and the United Nations.</p>
<p>3. DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES: High Frequency radios operate in the 3 to 30 megahertz range of the radio frequency spectrum. The radio transmissions propagate through the atmosphere via line of sight or via the ionosphere, where the maximum theoretical range is 10,000+ kilometers. High Frequency radio is inexpensive, and a well-understood technology that is used extensively by coalition military. It is usually a backup means of communication because of its limited bandwidth and antenna space requirements. However, High Frequency radio is often used as the primary means of communication in disaster relief and humanitarian assistance scenarios, as well as in situations where commercial information technology infrastructure is damaged or unavailable. For this reason, African partner nation personnel employ High Frequency radio more often than any other communications technology. The particular radios that are being considered for this effort are military-grade tactical radios that can securely communicate using both voice and data.</p>
<p>The African Union Command, Control, Communications and Information Systems program aims to enable communication between the African Union and the Regional Economic Centers, which control African Standby Forces. African Standby Forces are employed in a variety of peacekeeping missions on the continent of Africa. High Frequency radio can operate either in line of sight or beyond line of sight, making it the radio of choice vs. VHF or UHF radio which have greater constraints on their effective range. African Partner Nation personnel are familiar with High Frequency radio technology and currently employ it in their day-to-day activities. In addition, High Frequency radio can operate independent of infrastructure, to support communications in austere, disconnected mission locations that do not have available information technology infrastructure such as Internet service providers or satellite communications. If the Codan equipment is not purchased, the African Union headquarters, regional economic centers, and African Standby Forces will not have a means of secure communications. Non-secure means of communication could result in the compromise of the mission and possible loss of life. If a non-interoperable solution is chosen, the existing Harris-based High Frequency radio network supporting a current African Union mission will have to be redesigned or replaced, resulting in a monetary loss of approximately $. <br /><br />The CODAN High Frequency radios employ encryption based on the non-proprietary Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), which uses a 256-bit digital encryption key. The existing Harris radios used in a current African Union mission are also capable of using AES encryption The end-state goal is to enable secure voice and data communications between the African Union Headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, African Union missions and the 5 regional economic centers.</p>
<p>The initial link will be established between the African Union Headquarters and The Economic Community for West African States. Follow-on communications will be established between the African Union Headquarters and a current African Union mission. Each link will operate on separate frequencies.</p>

<p>This procurement includes equipment contained in Enclosure 2, Equipment List as above. The funding will be Department of Defense.</p>
<p>4. IDENTIFICATION OF STATUTORY AUTHORITY: Pursuant to the authority of 10 USC 2304c(1) and FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(i)</p>
<p>5. DEMONSTRATION OF CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS:</p>
<p>The U.S. Africa Command previously purchased High Frequency radio equipment for the African Union from the Harris Corporation under a contract with DRS technologies. This equipment is in use for current African Union operations, and therefore represents the interoperability baseline. Harris Corporation has provided an interoperable solution for linking this mission network to a continent-wide C2 network. The Directorate of Defense Trade Control (DDTC) has classified multiple equipment items in the Harris Corporation solution as defense articles. Defense articles are governed by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) laws and require approval by the DDTC in order to obtain an export license. There are three (3) countries in the African Union which are on the ITAR's proscribed country list that prevents US Government engagement projects. Therefore, the US Africa Command will be unable to obtain an export license for the ITAR-restricted Harris equipment. Past efforts to obtain ITAR waivers for ITAR-restricted Harris equipment have failed.</p>
<p>The US Africa Command then performed a market survey to identify an alternative vendor that could meet mission requirements and the interoperability baseline. The market survey concluded that CODAN Inc demonstrates unique capabilities for radio interoperability, as demonstrated in Afghanistan.&nbsp; CODAN is the only vendor to offer exportable (i.e. non-ITAR-rated) equipment proven to meet mission requirements, operational goals and subsequent deadlines. CODAN High Frequency radios are manufactured and sold by an Australian company and thus governed and controlled by legislation issued by the Australian government. CODAN High Frequency radios are therefore not subject to the US Department of State's Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and the equipment does not require a commodity jurisdiction under the US Munitions List. An export license is only required by the Australian Government for encryption and frequency hopping modes only; the basic radio configuration does not require an export license.&nbsp; <br /><br />Further, current CODAN High Frequency radio networks in Africa support African Union missions with the NGT series of High Frequency radios, internally fitted with CODAN CALM (CODAN Automatic Link Management) and CODAN Voice Encryption. CODAN is the only source of supply available to the African Union to ensure the High Frequency radios sought under this acquisition are fully interoperable with existing CODAN-based High Frequency radio networks. Technical interoperability comprises CODAN proprietary encryption, MIL-STD-188-141B Automatic Link Establishment (ALE), with CODAN Automatic Link Management certified via Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) and Over-The-Air (OTA) radio status capabilities. In addition, CODAN is able to provide high power High Frequency radios supporting up to 1000 watts of output power, critical to support the High Frequency radio links specified under the AUC3IS program requirements. USAFRICOM also intends to utilize CODAN's existing service support center network throughout Africa to reduce costs associated with in-country logistics and sustained support to this program. It is therefore critical to procure High Frequency radios fully interoperable with CODAN in order to fulfill USAFRICOM's African Union Command, Control, and Communications Information Systems (AUC3IS) mission to support present and future African Union peacekeeping operations.</p>
<p>Installation of CODAN equipment by non-CODAN certified installers will void the warranties of existing equipment, thereby causing unacceptable delays and additional costs to the African Union and USG when maintenance is required. Therefore, certified CODAN installers are required to fulfill equipment warranty validation (three years on manufacturing, design and/ or component defects).<br /><br />6. FEDBIZOPPS ANNOUNCEMENT/POTENTIAL SOURCES: This J&amp;A will be posted on FEDBIZOPPS.</p>
<p>7. DETERMINATION OF FAIR AND REASONABLE COST: The anticipated cost to the US Government will be determined fair and reasonable prior to award.</p>
<p><br />8. MARKET RESEARCH: The US Africa Command performed a market survey of exportable military-grade High Frequency radios, the manufacturers, their country of origin, and the available encryption options. Due to the austere operating environment, the radios must be military-grade and resistant to extreme temperatures, humidity, corrosion, dust, and contact with direct sunlight. In order to securely interoperate with the existing Harris high frequency radios owned and operated by the African Union, the radios must feature AES 256-bit encryption or Citadel encryption. In order to be exported to the African Union (ITAR exempt), these radios must not originate from the United States. Based on link modeling and analysis performed independently by CODAN and Harris, these radios must utilize the entire High Frequency spectrum (3 to 30 Mhz) and have the capability to be connected to a high-power amplifier (400W minimum) to ensure reliable, continuous operation between sites over challenging terrain. These radios also cannot be designated AN/PRC or PSC (Army-Navy portable radio component/portable secure radio component) equipment, as these designations connote restrictions on whom can purchase the equipment (usually only US military and allies). Entities such as the African Union and the regional economic centers are not military organizations or US allies. Based on the constraints above, CODAN is the sole High Frequency radio manufacturer that can provide a solution which will interoperate with the existing African Union High Frequency radio network. All other surveyed manufacturers&nbsp;were either restricted by ITAR, encryption type, or output power, and do not meet the established requirements. <br /><br /><br /><br />9. ANY OTHER SUPPORTING FACTS: All CODAN equipment and installers must certify that they are CODAN certified as of the date of the submission of their offer and that all certifications/ specializations required as defined by CODAN to support the product sale, support and product pricing, have been met.</p>
<p>10. LISTING OF INTERESTED SOURCES:</p>
<p>a. CODAN US CORP<br /><br />b. Harris Corporation<br />RF Communications Division<br /><br /><br />11. ACTIONS TAKEN TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO COMPETITION: USAFRICOM fully supports competition among vendors and brands. Although this document is for a sole source item, a requirements document was provided to the vendors for equal competition.</p>

<DESC><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On March 16, 2011, the GSA Region 6 issued a sources sought for the proposed IDIQ CM Contract. Target audiences for that notice were 8(a), HUBZone and Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business concerns. The audience for the sources sought issued on April 12, 2011&nbsp;is the&nbsp;Small Business Community under the NAICS Code 236220 Building Alterations, Non-Residential, Commercial, &amp; Institutional (General Construction).</span></strong></p>
<p>This is not a solicitation announcement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and will not result in a contact award.</p>
<p>This is a sources sought synopsis is for Small Business concerns only. No solicitation exists. This sources sought synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Since this is a sources sought announcement, no evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the respondents.</p>
<p>The General Services Administration, Public Buildings Service, Heartland Region, is conducting a sources sought for all Small Business with the capabilities of providing Construction Management (CM) services for the States of Iowa and Missouri. The specific geographical areas are 1) State of Iowa (Excluding the cities of Council Bluffs and Sioux City, Iowa), and 2) the State of Missouri east of Columbia, Missouri. Firms must be able to perform in both of the specific geographical areas. Additionally, the GSA will reserve the right to issue orders for all of Region 6 (Kansas, Iowa, Missouri, and Nebraska).</p>
<p>Contract Type: GSA anticipates the award of a Multiple-Award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for CM services.

Task orders will be issued under the IDIQ contract for the specific geographical areas listed above.</p>
<p>The minimum guarantee amount of $1,000 is to be awarded in the base contract period. As needed, it is anticipated that the majority of individual work orders are for construction costs estimated to be from $150,000 to $3,000,000, including any future prospectus or ARRA needs. The annual estimated magnitude for all work orders in a one year period is between $1,000,000-5,000,000. The estimated maximum contract value (base plus 4 one-year options) for each contract awarded is $25,000,000.</p>
<p>Geographical Area Familiarity: Most of the work associated with this contract will be located in the Des Moines, IA and Saint Louis, MO metropolitan areas. While GSA does not require an office to be located within the geographical area an understanding of construction trade practices in the area is essential for construction management. Firms must provide, in their capabilities statement, a narrative stating their knowledge and experience in conducting business in specific geographical area this contract will service.</p>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
IAW FAR 6.303
VETERANS BENEFITS ADMINISTRATION

Upon the basis of the following justification, I hereby approve the issuance of the contractual action described below using other than full and open competition, pursuant to the authority cited herein.

1.  Contracting Activity

     Department of Veterans Affairs
     Veterans Benefits Administration
     Atlanta VA Regional Office
     Atlanta, GA  30033

2.  Nature of Action Being Approved:  This justification and approval sets forth the facts and requests approval for the issuance of a Delivery Order, to Turnkey Service, Inc., 210 Walnut Ridge Street, Jackson, MS 39157.

3. Description of Service and Supplies:  The Cheyenne VA Regional Office Center currently has a requirement, mandated by the VBA Office of Field Operations and the Undersecretary for Benefits, to realign and renovate its VA-owned office space in a phased construction project. Since no swing space is available outside the current facility, that swing space must be created in 50% of the space to accommodate VBA employees onsite during the eight-month duration of the construction project. The scope of the proposed contract includes furniture reconfiguration and relocation labor, cabling services, and project management to support the creation of swing space for the project in four succeeding phases.

4.  Statutory Authority:  The statutory authority of this justification is FAR 6.302-2(b)(2)

5.  Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:  We request that Turnkey Service, Inc. be awarded this reconfiguration and relocation services contract based on the determination that this award represents the best value for the government.

Turnkey Service of Jackson, MS, a woman-owned small business, successfully completed the space planning, design scope, and relocation plans for this realignment project. In this activation phase, the creation of functional swing space with existing furniture, and the multiple moves of employees involved require mastery of the details of this project and flawless execution. Turnkey Service's  prior creation of the swing space plan under an existing design contract, and comprehensive knowledge of the logistics required to perform successfully, represents the best value to the government.

VBA has a minor construction contract, awarded by the Veteran's Health Administration (VHA), and the contractor is ready to begin construction.  Due to the continuing resolution (CR), VBA has already delayed the project by 30 days.  VBA is liable for contractor costs associated with any continued delays.  The delays can be calculated on a day-by-day basis to compensate the construction contractor for work that would have been performed. There is an immediate need to provide service for the reconfiguration and phased moving support on the Cheyenne project.  Any further delays would result in financial injury to the government.

6.  Description of Market Research: N/A

7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable: No cost proposal has yet been received from the contractor.

8.  Other Supporting Data:  N/A

9.  Other Interested Sources:  N/A

10.	Future barriers to competition:  Before any additional requirements are awarded, we 
will search the market and see if there are any new sources available which would meet our requirements, and could possibly offer a better value to the government.  

  11.  I certify that this justification is complete and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief.
