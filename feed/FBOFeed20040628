<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia intends to award a cost-reimbursement type contract to a qualified offeror for a Strengths Based Management Training for ARTAS Demonstration Project.  The purpose of this contract is to develop a curriculum and a training manual, and deliver training for case managers who are doing linkage case management.  The curriculum and training manual will apply to multiple case manager settings in U.S. communities.  The training will be of 10-18 case managers employed by the Antiretroviral Treatment and Access Study (ARTAS) demonstration cooperative agreement.  The curriculum and training manual will be general enough to apply to case managers employed by a variety of U.S. agencies (community organizations, health departments, etc.) who have been delivering case management services to HIV-infected individuals.  The main focus of the training component is to give case managers the skills needed to help clients identify strengths and resources useful in linkage to care.  The training must incorporate a strengths-based methodology in order to assist clients in identifying resources that will allow them to engage in HIV care.  This training will give new case managers adequate knowledge and skills needed to function independently and with very little supervision.  The training is designed to complement the demonstration project described below.  The recipient of this contract will need to produce a manual that will incorporate the curriculum that could be used by future organizations doing such training, as well as specifics related to how a case manager should perform linkage case management.  The training shall include case managers from each site selected for the ARTAS demonstration project.  It is anticipated that up to nine sites will be selected to participate in the ARTAS demonstration project.  A final list of the sites will be provided to the successful offeror upon award.  The date specified for receipt of offers will be approximately 30 days after the solicitation issue date, on or about August 12, 2004.  The performance period under this contract will be 24 months from date of contract award.  The NAICS code is 541690 and all responsible offers will be considered by the agency.  Paper copies of the solicitation will not be made available; however, the solicitation will be available for retrieval at www.fedbizopps.gov website on or about July 12, 2004.  It will be the responsibility of individual offerors to monitor this website for additional postings regarding this solicitation.  Telephonic/ facsimile requests will not be accepted.

<DESC>1	Scope.

This Statement of Work (SOW) defines the requirements for developing personnel in the Systems Definition Branch (N641) into systems analyst capable of performing systems engineering tasks from requirements development to acceptance testing. The Systems Integration Division (N64) is the central development agency for web services implementation for FORCENET NAVOCEANO. This is a new technology for N64, and the roles, interactions and responsible work products required by each branch within the division need to be analyzed and clearly defined.  The use of a new technology as well as the changing role of N64 has created a gap in the knowledge and skill sets required by personnel within N641. This group must now interface with subject matter experts from other NAVOCEANO codes and be able to translate requirements into work products needed by N64 developers.

2	Requirements.

2.1  N64 CONOPS. 

The contractor shall facilitate development of a N64 concept of operations (CONOPS) that describes the roles, responsibilities and the work products required by each branch within N64.

2.1.1   Contractor Responsibility.

•	Facilitate a meeting involving key stakeholders to:
&#61662;	  Define an updated set of roles and responsibilities for each branch;
&#61662;	  Identify specific skill sets needed by N641 to carry out those roles and responsibilities;
&#61662;	  Perform a gap analysis between the “as is” and the “to be” state with the focus on N641.

2.1.2  Government Responsibility.

•	 Write a CONOPS for N64 that justifies the new skills required by N641 and provide a copy to the contractor for evaluation and feedback.

2.2  Curriculum Design.

The contractor shall design a curriculum that fills the gaps in the skill set and knowledge requirements for N641 to operate effectively and efficiently in the “to be” state. This curriculum must span the whole systems engineering lifecycle activities that N641 is responsible for. It should also address the interface activities between N641 and the developers required communicating the system conceptual view and identifying impacts to the system architecture. 

2.2.1  Instructor Responsibility.

•	Provide advance copy of the curriculum for review and approval by the government.
•	Recommend a training schedule.
•	Incorporate curriculum and schedule changes based on government feedback.

2.2.2  Government Responsibility.

•	Review the recommended curriculum and schedule, and provide feedback to the contractor within 5 working days

2.3  Execute Curriculum.

The contractor shall deliver the training curriculum in accordance with the agreed upon schedule.



3.0	Invoices and Payment

The contractor shall propose a deliverable and payment schedule for this requirement.  Copies of receipts, travel vouchers, etc., completed in accordance with Federal Travel Regulations shall be attached to the invoice to support charges.  In addition, the contractor shall attach the deliverable acceptance form signed by the client representative.  Original receipts shall be maintained by the contractor and made available to Government auditors upon request.  

Invoices for final payment must be so identified and submitted when the task has been completed and no further charges are to be billed.

Payment of invoices will be made based upon acceptance by the Government that acceptable deliverables were provided.  Contractor’s are required to submit an electronic copy of each invoice through GSA electronic system after receipt of acceptance from the client representative or designated representative.  Contractor has the option of posting the invoice on GSA’s Ft. Worth web site or mail to the address below.  NOTE:  Only use one method of submission, web site or regular U.S. mail, but not both.

Mail your invoices to the following address:

GSA Accts Payable Br (7BCP)
299X
P.O. Box 17181, Fund 299X
Fort Worth, TX 76102-0181

4.0	PERSONAL SERVICES.  GSA meets the needs of its clients for information technology support through non-personal services contracts.  To counter the circumstances that infer personal services and to preserve the non- personal nature of the contract, the contractor shall adhere to the following guidelines in the performance of the task:

4.1 Provide for direct supervision of all contract employees assigned to the task.

4.2 Refrain from discussing the issues such as skill levels and hours, salaries, cost and funding data, or administrative and personnel matters affecting contractor employees with the client.

4.3 Ensure close communication/coordination with the GSA CSR, reporting problems to the CSR as they occur (not waiting for a monthly meeting).

4.4 Do not permit government officials to interview potential contractor employees, discuss individual performance, approve leave or work scheduling of contractor employees, terminate contractor employees, assist contractor employees in doing their jobs or obtain assistance from the contractor in doing Government job.

4.5 Do not assign contractor personnel to work under direct government supervision.

4.6 Maintain a professional distance from government employees.

4.7 Provide contractor employees with badges, if appropriate, identifying them as contractors.

4.8 Ensure proper communications with the government (technical discussion and government surveillance is okay, but the Government cannot tell the contractor how to do the job).

4.9 Assign a task leader to the task order. The task leader or alternate should be the only one who accepts tasking from the assigned Government point of contact or alternative.

4.10  The government has the right to reject the finished product or result and this does not constitute personal services.

4.11 When travel is required for the performance on a task, the contractor personnel are only to travel as directed by their contract management.

<DESC>This synopsis constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 35.106.  There will be no formal request for proposals or other solicitation regarding this announcement.  It is anticipated that information other than provided within this BAA will be disseminated.  This BAA is requesting the submission of INITIAL proposals from industry, educational institutions, and other non-profit organizations on 1) utilizing commercial off the shelf (COTS) desktop software that will further improve the training programs currently being used and reduce the efforts required to support these events using desktop modeling and simulation tools, and 2) identifying hardware, software, and procedural initiatives that provide unique functional capabilities and technological enhancements to the operational training of joint forces and are value-added to the JNTC.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

United States Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM) is the chief advocate for jointness and the Joint Warfighting Center (JWFC), as chief advocate for Joint Force Training Transformation, contributes to the Nation’s current and future joint force capabilities and joint capable forces in support of the National Security Strategy.  To meet the challenges of the 21st century, the JWFC conducts joint force training and validates joint concepts using training as an integrating environment.  The JWFC also provides and supports world-wide joint training for Combatant Commanders (COCOM), leads the development and operation of systems and architectures for distributed joint training, and provides support for joint training-related modeling and simulation.  

As part of this overall training effort, USJFCOM has been directed by the Deputy Secretary of Defense to establish a Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) under the auspices of the JWFC to integrate a network of live ranges, simulations and simulators, including both testing and training assets, that supports joint, interoperable and service-level training. To orchestrate this, USJFCOM has established the JNTC Joint Management Office (JMO) to collect, merge and validate joint training requirements and put in place key plans and processes focused on the operational needs of the services and combatant commands. JMO functions include: planning; requirements analysis and validation;  systems engineering; joint training architecture and standards development; performance measurement of joint training capabilities; and advice to Services, OSD, and agencies providing joint context for research, development, experimentation and acquisition decisions. Eventual full functionality will consist of the following work breakdown under the JMO’s core program management: Joint Training System Applications (JTSA); Joint Command and Control (JCC); Standing Joint Force Headquarters (SJFHQ) Core Element; standing Opposition Forces (OPFOR); Global Joint Training Infrastructure (GJTI); and Advanced Training Technologies (ATT).  The four pillars of training transformation constitute the overarching guidance for JNTC enhancements.  The pillars are described below: 

JNTC PILLARS and THEIR MEANING:
(1.) Realistic Combat Training, meaning Joint context - horizontal/vertical, Employs joint doctrine/tactics/techniques, Live training with simulation/stimulation, Mission rehearsal implications, Realistic information ops and C4ISR and Potentially deployable/distributable.  (2.) Opposing Forces, meaning Multi-dimensional peer adversary, Asymmetric challenges and Diverse targets/threats.  (3.) Ground Truth, meaning Integrated range instrumentation, Joint Observer/Trainers and Certified, accredited.  (4.) Feedback, meaning Focus on joint performance outcomes, Ability to assess concepts and doctrine, Feeds joint lessons learned and Promotes Joint Training System use. 

 
JWFC is significantly interested in identifying technological and functional enhancements to current capabilities used in the operational training of joint forces.  JWFC is soliciting input from industry, educational institutions, and other non-profit organizations on 1) utilizing commercial off the shelf (COTS) desktop software that will further improve the training programs currently being used and reduce the efforts required to support these events using desktop modeling and simulation tools, and 2) identifying hardware, software, and procedural initiatives that provide unique functional capabilities and technological enhancements to the operational training of joint forces and are value-added to the JNTC.  Sections 2 and 3 describe these needed capabilities in more detail. Initial proposals will be accepted up to 45 days after this BAA is posted by the Contracting Officer.  The deliverable will be a Proof of Concept due within 90 days after award of a contract.   

This BAA is being used to engage industry, educational institutions, and non-profit organizations in order to attract state of the art solutions for joint training needs.   Additionally, USJFCOM will hold a Focused Forum in the September or October time frame to discuss the results of the Training Capability Analysis of Alternatives effort currently being finished.   

1.1 AUTHORITY

The Department of the Navy, Naval Supply Systems Command, FISC Norfolk Detachment Philadelphia, 700 Robbins Avenue, Building 2B, Philadelphia, PA 19111-5083, issues this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA).  Contracts with educational institutions, nonprofit organizations, and private industry for research and development may be issued in those areas covered in Section 2.0 of this BAA.  This BAA is intended to cover the research and development of state of the art training technologies in support of establishing a robust JNTC.   Pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulations 35.016, this solicitation is for basic and applied research and that part of development not related to the development of a specific system or hardware procurement.  

1.2 PROCESS

The following process is established for submission of a proposal under this BAA.  As this is a 2-step process, the Government’s acceptance of an initial proposal may result in the Contracting Officer requesting the submission of a formal proposal followed by a contract award.  

1.2.1	Step 1 - Initial Proposal

Your proposed research project should be described in sufficient detail to identify its relationship to and value to the joint training program described in this announcement.  Specific areas covered under this BAA are further described in Sections 2 and 3.  The Government may request that the respondent provide a demonstration of their proposed solution in order to assist in the selection process.

1.2.2 	Step 2  - Submission of Formal Research Proposal

If there is sufficient interest in a proposed research project, the Contracting Officer will request the submission of a formal research proposal.   The primary basis for selecting initial proposals for award shall be scientific/technical merit, importance to JWFC programs, and cost realism/reasonableness.  

 
2.0 JWFC RESEARCH NEEDS

2.1	OVERVIEW            

Technical requirements for the JWFC are derived from the operational requirements of COCOMs, the Services, and Agencies.  It is anticipated that the overall technical infrastructure for the JWFC will be enhanced by: a) establishing a long term vision “To Be” architecture that is scalable and evolves with emerging and changing technology and requirements, b) instantiating a small-scale prototype, and c) growing and evolving toward the “To Be” architecture through a spiral development process.

2.2 TECHNICAL FOCUS AREAS

Simulations are typically expensive, one of a kind systems used to create models with very little re-use, sharing, or interoperability.  Simulations are also difficult to maintain, operate, and make changes to, requiring significant people and dollar resources on an ongoing basis.  The lack of an industry standard simulation software which runs on standard PC hardware (e.g. the equivalent of standard industry presentation software) limits the accessibility of simulation technology to only a few, higher-end needs.

The final result should be a flexible, COTS-based simulation software toolkit that can be used to rapidly create and modify training and planning simulations for land, sea, air, and joint missions, involving a common synthetic natural environment and database structure, which can provide views of both single entity and aggregated forces in the same simulation.  These integrated applications should be able to be run from desktop computers utilizing simple drop and drag capabilities.   

The following focus areas comprise the primary technical fields of interest for the JWFC program.  These do not preclude submission in another category considered by the offeror to have a high probability of interest to the joint planning, training, mission rehearsal, and experimentation communities.  These initial proposals will be evaluated, in part, by their contribution to one or more of the following areas:

2.2.1 Multi-resolution modeling (MRM) capabilities are required to support both aggregated (e.g. Brigade, Wing, Task Group, city, state) and entity-level objects (e.g. tank, aircraft, ship, trucks, trains, buildings) in a single simulation model using simple desktop drag and drop applications. This capability must achieve a level of granularity sufficient to support Joint Urban Operations training and experiments.   Future MRM development will reduce the number of simulation model federates and associated overhead to run large model federations.

2.2.2	A common synthetic natural environment (SNE) is required to link different simulations, resulting in the ability to share data and models as well as dissimilar development processes and appearances for both terrain and real world objects.   This capability supports the common training environment and also enhances the rapid database development effort.

 
3.0 JNTC RESEARCH NEEDS

3.1 OVERVIEW            

Technical requirements for the JNTC shall be derived from the operational requirements of COCOMs and the Services.  It is anticipated that the overall technical infrastructure for the JNTC will be achieved by: a) establishing a long term vision “To Be” architecture that is scalable and evolves with emerging and changing technology and requirements, b) instantiating a small-scale prototype, and c) growing and evolving toward the “To Be” architecture through a spiral development process.   If required, offerors also need to ensure that any initial proposal addresses how their system performs within the Global Information Grid (GIG) specifications by meeting the Net Centric requirements established by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Networks and Information Integration).   These requirements are delineated in the DoD Net Centric Data Strategy and the DoD Net Centric Check List.

In order to define, build, implement, and maintain the technical architecture required to support the operational training concepts of the JNTC, a well-structured and defined technical research program shall be established and managed by the JNTC ATT Director.  Until recently there has been no single portal for migration of technology and technical training concepts into a single joint context.  This however, is necessary for the JNTC to achieve its mission of “training the joint warfighter.”  This portal is the flagship laboratory for the JNTC, known as the JNTC Advanced Training Technology Laboratory (JATTL).  This laboratory will act as a lens by concentrating on Research, Development, Test & Evaluation (RDT&E) of technologies, which enhance capabilities in the JNTC technical focus areas (Command, Control, Communications, Computers & Intelligence (C4I); Live, Virtual and Constructive (LVC) Environment; Instrumentation, Data Collection and After Action Review (AAR); Opposing Forces; Information/Knowledge Management; Architecture/Standards) while ensuring interoperability, maturity, stability and most importantly relevance for candidate technologies under development for use in Service and joint training environments.  The ATT mission is to evolve, enhance and provide tools, processes and products for the JNTC by acting as the technology pipeline in support of joint training for the warfighter.  A sustained process using systems engineering and acquisition best practices to identify, evolve, enhance and develop new capabilities that address training requirements, challenges and shortfalls is essential.  ATT will leverage existing and future Science & Technology (S&T) investments to a maximum extent with Industry, Academia, Government and International organizations.  Finally, by taking a holistic approach, the JATTL will assimilate joint standards and architectures to enable a seamless integrated LVC training environment for on demand warfighter use.

3.2 TECHNICAL FOCUS AREAS

The following focus areas comprise the primary technical fields of interest for the JNTC Program.  These do not preclude submission in another category considered by the offeror to have a high probability of interest to the joint planning, training, mission rehearsal, and experimentation communities.  Initial proposals will be evaluated, in part, by their contribution to one or more of these current areas; or, by exception, to significant contributions in another area. 		
 
3.2.1 JOINT COMMAND, CONTROL, COMMUNICATIONS, ANDCOMPUTERS (C4) ENABLING  CAPABILITIES 

The JNTC plan for focusing on Joint C4 systems is to develop, install, operate, and maintain a dedicated, persistent, bandwidth-on-demand infrastructure available anytime at key combatant command, service, agency, or interagency locations throughout the world.  These organizations will have access to train, test, evaluate, and experiment with Command and Control & Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C2 & ISR) capabilities.   Selected projects will research, develop, test, evaluate and integrate new or improved technologies, standards, processes, and concepts that support the Joint C4 systems to include SIPRNET connectivity to non-DISA provisioned DoD networks, permanent network infrastructure technologies, peering, multi-level security, multi-network security, and designing TADIL/JDN into the Joint Training Architecture.

3.2.2 JOINT INSTRUMENTATION AND AFTER ACTION REVIEW (AAR)

The Joint Training Data Infrastructure will put forth technical solutions for data systems that will enable joint, distributed training across DoD sites, simulation centers, Service, and combatant command training locations.  JNTC’s near-term focus for Joint Training Data Infrastructure is to develop a roadmap for JNTC range/simulation center interconnectivity, develop technical goals and timelines for instrumentation, data collection, and after action review standardization, and endorse service instrumentation-related procurement actions. Selected projects will research, develop, test, evaluate and integrate new or improved technologies, standards, processes, and concepts that support the Joint Instrumentation and AAR program to include live range security classification issues, validation and integration of live architecture, real-time casualty assessment capability “ground truth,” elimination of dual tracks, and data repository capability.  Research, develop and integrate roadmaps to ensure that Service instrumentation can migrate to Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA) compliance. 

3.2.3 JOINT OPPOSING FORCES (OPFOR)

OPFOR technologies focus on identifying technological products/concepts that support establishment of a credible, full capability, adversary representation.  Selected projects will research, develop, test, evaluate and integrate new or improved technologies, standards, processes, and concepts that support the  OPFOR program to include realistic multi-spectral representations of ground, sea and airborne elements, improved and realistic OPFOR command, control, communications, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities, information and electronic attack to include Joint Offensive OPFOR Information Operations Capability and Joint Defensive OPFOR Information Operations Capability; upgraded real-time casualty assessment, reconfigurable and robust OPFOR command and control representations, integrated nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological effects, OPFOR firepower in live and simulated environments, OPFOR representation of  terrorism related activities, and OPFOR Scenario Development Capability.

3.2.4 JOINT LIVE VIRTUAL CONSTRUCTIVE (LVC) ENVIRONMENT

LVC technologies focus on identifying technological products/concepts that support establishment of a seamless joint training environment for horizontal, vertical, integrated and functional mission planning, rehearsal, training, and experimentation events.  Selected projects will research, develop, test, evaluate and integrate new or improved technologies, standards, processes, and concepts that support the LVC technology program to include database/scenario generation & repository, simulation initialization, mission planning/rehearsal, course of action, full spectrum, natural and accurate urban environment, common sensor engagement (level playing field), large-scale terrain representation, composable and scaleable simulation environments, non-attrition models (other than combat adjudication), federation tools to enhance development of a Joint Federated Object Model (JFOM), immersive visual technologies, story driven technologies and massive multi-player on-line gaming/military training application. 
  
3.2.5 JOINT KNOWLEDGE/INFORMATION MANAGEMENT

Knowledge/Information Management technology focus will identify and select advanced knowledge/information management and collaborative information environment technologies to ensure real-time, collaborative, distributed information sharing among JNTC participants.  Selected projects will research, develop, test, evaluate and integrate new or improved technologies, standards, processes, and concepts that support the  Knowledge/Information Management program to include collaborative tools for information sharing, knowledge management technologies, Joint Exercise Control Group (JECG) systems, information systems automation, WAN & SAN management, resource management, planning, and scheduling tools, and other large scale distributed computing IS solutions.

Fredom Street, Ravana, OH. 44266-2457 to conduct Phase 2 testing of  materials for the Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC).  This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reason:  Smithers has already performed the phase 1 testing, and needs to perform the phase 2 testing  otherwise this may introduce uncertainty into the results.   A direct quantitative comparison needs to be obtained between the phase 1 and phase 2 materials.  If a different test lab performs the phase 2 tests, they may not directly compare to the phase 1 results.  This is particularly true of the special, non-standard tests and test equipment developed by Smithers under the previous contract.  Thus Smithers Scientific Servi ces, Inc. is the only vendor that can meet this requirement. NAICS Code 541380 applies.

<DESC>Bechtel SAIC Company, LLC (BSC) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the award of a Subcontract to provide the services described below to pre-qualified bidders only.

To be deemed pre-qualified to receive an RFP, potential bidders must submit a competed Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Standard Form No. 254, "Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire," addressing specific areas of expertise and experience.  In addition, potential bidders must respond to the pre-qualification questions listed below. 

Note:  It shall be understood when completing this pre-qualification package that, should a potential bidder be pre-qualified and subsequently successful in winning the subcontract, the potential bidder will be excluded from bidding the future design and fabrication contracts.


SCOPE DEFINITION:

Background: BSC is in the preliminary design phase of the Yucca Mountain Project (YMP).  A key element needed early in preliminary design is the development of a site-specific storage cask performance specification or specifications.  Based on input from the Subcontractor, multiple specifications may be required to satisfy all cask parameters.  Others shall perform the site-specific cask design and fabrication (design will be competitively bid under a separate pre-qualification in late CY 2004 or early CY 2005).  The scope of this pre-qualification package is specifically to develop a performance specification(s) for the casks.  This performance specification(s) will be used to design future licensed cask(s), in accordance with 10 CFR 63, and subsequently fabricate the casks to be used specifically at the YMP.  Neither the subsequent design, nor the fabrication of the casks, will be included in the RFP for development of the cask performance specification(s).  

The Subcontractor will be required to have experience, and will be evaluated, in the following four (4) primary areas:

- Familiar with the development of commercial power plant design and procurement specifications for site specific casks;
- Experience working with commercial power plants (nuclear), storage cask systems, or Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installations;
- Experience developing licensing strategies for storage casks which have been licensed in accordance with 10 CFR 72; and
- Experience working with casks licensed under 10 CFR 72 and ability to apply experience to licensing a cask under 10 CFR 63. 
 Description of Work:  
BSC requires support to develop performance specification(s) to be used in the acquisition of detailed design, licensing, and fabrication of spent nuclear fuel aging casks and systems for the Yucca Mountain Repository site.  The content of the performance specifications would include, but not be limited to, the following:

- Dimensional outline and mechanical handling information
- Transporter outline information with separate performance specification(s)
- Aging configurations
- BWR/PWR fuel assembly parameters
- Spent nuclear fuel canister parameters
- Consistency with YMP licensing strategy
- List of all 10 CFR 63 requirements


LOCATION:
It is preferred that the Subcontractor has an office in Las Vegas, Nevada, however, it is not required.  


PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:
The estimated RFP issuance date is in the third quarter of CY 2004.  The anticipated planned date for award of the Subcontract is in the third quarter of CY 2004.  The estimated duration for performance is approximately four (4) months.


SUBCONTRACT TYPE:

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Radiation and Indoor Air (ORIA), Radiation Protection Division (RPD) intends to award a sole source firm-fixed-price Purchase Order using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures to The Gas Technology Institute (GTI) of Des Plaines, IL.  The purpose of this acquisition is to implement results and recommendations of a study titled "Evaluation of Soil Compaction Measuring Devices" to develop a portable gauging device that does not use radioactive sources for soil  compaction testing in the utility industry. Under this Purchase Order, the Contractor shall examine modifications to the Klegg Hammer, one of three devices chosen for optimization in the previous study. In addition, the Contractor shall conduct appropriate tests to evaluate modifications according  to the gas industry's criteria and produce a final report with the results.  It has been determined that because of a GTI's unique experience with soil compaction measurement and non-nuclear alternatives to industrial gauging, in addition to relationships with gas utility industry partners  concerning issues relating to technology development and excavation tools, it is the only known vendor uniquely qualified to satisfy the Government's requirement. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541620. NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE  (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which if received within 10 calendar days of the date of this announcement will be considered. Responses to this posting must be in writing. A determination  not to compete the proposed requirement based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Injury Prevention & Control (NCIPS), Division of Violence Prevention (DVP) seeks to utilize a vendor,  working in collaboration with CDC and ACE Center staff that will design, develop, review, edit, publish, and launch a written and web-based journal to highlight the work of youth and the ACE Centers.   Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the vendor shall provide all labor, materials, and supplies necessary, except those specified to be provided by the Government, in the review and preparation of this published journal and website.  
Youth violence is a public health issue affecting the physical and emotional health of young people. Homicide remains the second leading cause of death among 15- to 24-year olds. Within this age group, homicide is the leading cause of death for African Americans, the second leading cause of death for Hispanic Americans, and the third leading cause of death for Native Americans. In 1998, 5,431 youths ages 15-24 were murdered on an average of 15 every day. Young people represented approximately one-third of all homicide victims in that year. Given the role of violence and homicide as a public health issue for American youth, it is important that effective strategies be identified and implemented to reduce the number of young people losing their lives due to violence.  
Recent attention has been drawn to youth violence due to widely publicized incidents of school shootings. Although nonfatal acts of violence are relatively common on school property, most acts of serious and fatal violent crime occur outside of school. Despite the recent shootings on school campuses, less than 1 percent of all violent deaths among school-aged children occur in schools (CDC MMWR, 2001). These data highlight the need for comprehensive prevention programs - in schools, families, and communities - that address risk for violent behaviors both on and off school property.

The Academic Centers of Excellence on Youth Violence Prevention (ACE) were funded to serve as national models for the prevention of youth violence. The Centers have six core objectives: 
1)  providing the infrastructure to conduct interdisciplinary research relevant to youth violence;   
2)  supporting the surveillance of youth violence in their specific communities;  
3)  conducting innovative and relevant etiological work on risk and protective factors in youth violence;   
4)  developing, testing, and more broadly implementing effective violence prevention strategies;   
5)  offering mentoring and training initiatives to prepare professionals from diverse backgrounds to address the issue of  youth violence; and   
6)  creating partnerships with communities to develop plans to address youth violence.  

The purpose of this project is to fund the production and promotion of both a print and web version of a special issue of CYD Journal: Community Youth Development . This edition will be dedicated to highlighting the work of the National Academic Centers of Excellence on Youth Violence Prevention (ACE). The ACE Centers represent a newly-funded approach that links universities and communities, enabling them to translate and apply scientific knowledge on youth violence into community-based action. Using community empowerment as a vehicle to address youth violence is critical to the success of any youth violence prevention program. The CYD Journal and website will provide a mechanism for the ACE Centers to share critical information and lessons learned regarding their experiences working at multiple levels with governmental and educational organizations, local community organizations, and youth, to effectively address youth violence.  
This special issue of CYD (Community Youth Development)Journal (www.cydjournal.org) will describe the strategies and conceptual models employed by the ACE Centers and other youth violence prevention organizations for involving young people in community violence prevention research, evaluation, training, community mobilization, policy development and dissemination efforts.  Although youth are increasingly becoming involved with (and sometimes driving) efforts to reduce youth violence and to reduce the impact of violence on youth, the rationale for these activities and the techniques for successfully involving youth are known to too few organizations and agencies.  This issue will address this gap by reviewing recent efforts to involve youth in youth development programs, a need identified in the IOM report (Community Programs That Promote Youth Development).
TASKS TO BE PERFORMED

DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<RESPDATE>070104
<CONTACT>Phyliss Schlegel, (609)485-4380
<DESC>Due date for responses is close of business, Wednesday, June 30, 2004. Description of Requirement:  The Federal Aviation Administrations (FAA) Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS) Ground Facility (LGF) requires valid ranging source error estimates for all Global Positioning Service (GPS) Standard Positioning Service (SPS) satellites in view within a specified reception area.  Error estimates from a prototype LGF have been provided to the LAAS specification team in order to validate of the requirements of the specification using a dual-port L1 only antenna design.  While the dual-port design is effective, it requires additional receiver hardware.   A simpler broadband (L1/L2/L5) single-port design with reduced siting constraints would benefit the LAAS program by reducing the complexity of the validation prototype.  A review of the literature shows a number of antennae that have been proposed and built with these design goals, but, to date, none have proven feasible.  BAE Systems has independently researched and developed an antenna design that potentially will provide reception on multiple frequencies, with a large desired to undesired ratio reception pattern and low-error GPS measurements.  If the design concept proves successful, LTP data collection and operational capabilities will be greatly expanded.      Antenna Requirements:  The prototype antenna shall: Â·	Be capable of receiving GPS signals on L1, L5, and L2 within the reception mask specified in FAA-E-2937A. Â·	Provide the received signals on a single antenna port for all elevations between 5 and 90 degrees. Â·	Provide a desired to undesired amplitude ratio for single reflection ground-induced multipath of at least 30dB for elevation angles between 5 and 35 degrees. Â·	Provide an omni-directional azimuth gain pattern, Â±1dB, as a function of elevation. Â·	Provide the signals without any azimuth dependent group or phase delay variations exceeding Â±1cm. Â·	Provide the signals without any elevation dependent group or phase delay variations exceeding Â±1cm. Â·	Provide the signals utilizing multiple right-hand circularly polarized antenna elements. Technical Approach:  In addition to meeting the technical requirements, assembly and demonstration shall be conducted in two separate phases.  The first phase is assembly and proof of the basic properties of the reception element.  The second optional phase will include assembly and testing of a complete prototype antenna array.   Performance verification shall consist of controlled laboratory tests, antenna test range measurements, and reception of the live GPS SPS constellation.  The FAA will conduct validation testing. The contractor must have in in-depth understanding and expertise in antenna design and manufacturing and be a recognized leader in the aviation community for aircraft safety by:  serving on thefully cognizant of FAAs research and development activities and objectives for this type of equipment.  participating in aircraft safety related conferences (e.g. Aging Aircraft Conference) as a speaker, chairman, and or a member of the organizing committee.In addition, the contractor must have the infrastructure in place for this work including all equipment and manpower.  This includes, but is not limited to:access to resources and facilities to perform all research tasks. Based on review of the literature and current knowledge of the industry, BAE Systems is considered to be the only source with the requisite design and technical capabilities.   A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement.  If your company does not agree with this single source determination, please provide evidence of requisite capabilities, equipment and experience in providing similar research service for FAA to evaluate.  All responses to this announcement must be in writing and directed to Phyliss Schlegel no later than close of business Thursday, June 30, 2004.  Responses may be sent to the attention of Ms. Schlegel by fax at 609.485-4088 or by e-mail at: phyliss.schlegel@faa.gov.

<DESC>This is a modification of a previously issued Source Sought Synopsis: The Naval Sea System Command (NAVSEA) is issuing a Request for Information (RFI) from all interested companies who may be interested in providing eligible foreign navies access to a broad range of life cycle support and other services associated with the acquisition, operation and maintenance of naval vessels within their inventory. These services typically will be provided for recipients of former United States Navy (USN) ships transferred through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program.  However, services of other foreign navy ships built indigenously or acquired from other sources are also eligible within current International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) guidelines for support services.  The Tasks section of this RFI provides additional information on the spe cifics of services being sought.  This RFI in no way binds the Government to offer contracts to responding companies.  The information provided will assist NAVSEA in developing and further defining future procurement and acquisition strategies.  Description  The eventual competitively selected contractor shall accomplish tasks associated with a full range of support/services to a number of FMS customers throughout the world in support of their ships, platforms, combat systems and industrial facilities. The support/services will vary in complexity based on the requested services.   The contractor will be required to make available a fully functional shipyard within the US in order to fulfill the commitments of the US Government in the transfer of ex-USN ships which includes the overhaul/upgrade of major/minor Hull, Mechanical & Electrical (HM&E) and Combat systems. Tr ansfers are normally compressed and the fulfillment of on-time delivery is critical. The contractor will provide a wide range of industrial professionals along with other specialty employees comprised of logistics, engineers, on-site managers, port engineers and other areas of expertise when/if required. The contractor will also be tasked to provide emergent teams within a large variety of skills and expertise to support the customer in country (foreign) at any given time, many times within short notice. They may also be required to establish a fully functional industrial support team in country to support major industrial events (often long term) such as ship overhauls, industrial upgrades, planning yard functions, etc. The contractor in support of this will maintain all the employees’ certifications within their respective fields and ensure compliance of both ISO and USN s tandards along with a fully compliant quality assurance program. Due to the nature of the funding on any resultant contract, all associated start-up cost incurred will be at the expense of the contractor and will not be reimbursed. Tasks Non-specific but critical tasks include: 1) Accomplish 1200 lb steam boiler overhaul and repair. 2) Accomplish gas turbine engine overhaul and repair. 3) Accomplish Combat Systems overhauls, installation and repairs to include today's modern highly integrated multi-mission combat systems.   4)  Provide a workforce to furnish full support services for the overhaul of ex-USN combatants (both HM&E and Combat Systems) within and outside the US along with providing shipyard and industrial upgrade services often at the same time.  This will require the contractor to have a large and qualified professional workforce at his disposa l. 5)  Provide services to include design, configuration management, maintenance, repair planning and execution, logistics and training in support of the transfer of decommissioned US Navy ships made available for FMS "hot" transfer or previously decommissioned ships available for "cold" transfer.    6)  Develop work packages, work items, cost estimates, drawings and engineering data to accomplish authorized alterations and update selected record data.  Identify long-lead time and other industrial material required.   7)  Assume full management responsibility for ship transfer reactivation availabilities including stringent cost and schedule control.  Develop integrated test and training plans including waterfront production activities, delivery of Government Furnished Equipment, crew training, equipment light-off, system testing and ship trials.  All resources includi ng manpower, facilities and services must be included in integrated plans.   8)  Provide materials, manpower and services for dry-docking, repair and maintenance of ship hull, mechanical, electrical, communications, command and control, navigation and combat systems as directed by an authorized work package.   9)  Provide qualified personnel to accomplish emergent and voyage repairs. 10)  Provide qualified personnel to assemble a Ship Transfer Assist Team and Transit Assist Team to provide onboard crew training and equipment verification and to assist the ship from its reactivation site to country homeport.   11) Provide a full range of operator and maintainer training at the FMS customer country's site, as requested.   12) Provide warehousing and data repository services at a facility located in the US.    Responses Defense and commercial contractors, incl uding small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, and woman-owned small businesses are encouraged to participate.  North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 336611, that has an average employment size standard of 1,000 employees during each of the pay periods of the preceding 12 months, will apply to this acquisition. Responses to this RFI should be limited to 10 pages or less (including any amendments) and include supporting materials that allows an effective evaluation of your company’s competence, experience, and overall  understanding of the scope of work that NAVSEA has identified.  In addition, interested contractors should provide evidence of how they intend to be responsive to urgent and short lead-time requirements.  Submissions should include company history, company size,  major products, primary customer base, points of contacts (able to discuss the submitted materials), and a description of past experience.  Responding companies and associated personnel must be able to obtain the requisite security clearances as required and be registered or have a pending registration on CCR (www.ccr.gov).  Responses are requested by 10:00 am (EST), on 14 July 2004 to support the Government’s milestone objectives.  However, submissions will be accepted after this date but feedback may not be as timely or contribute to NAVSEA’s strategic planning.  Information should be e-mailed to Tara Borntreger at borntregertj@navsea.navy.mil or mailed to Naval Sea Systems Command, Attn: Ms. Tara Borntreger, Mail Stop: 2030, 1333 Isaac Hull Avenue SE, Washington Navy Yard, D.C., 20376.  Questions can be submitted electronically to borntregertj@navsea.navy.mil.

<DESC>The Cancer Prevention Studies Branch (CPSB) of the Center for Cancer Research (CCR) and the Biostatistics Branch (BB) of the Division of Cancer Etiology and Genetics (DCEG), National Cancer Institute (NCI) intends to negotiate with the Cancer Institute of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CICAMS) for a one year with four options to: (1) obtain updated endpoint data on the Nutrition Intervention Trials participants; (2) collect and store all available diagnostic materials for Nutrition Intervention Trials participants for new cancers diagnosed; (3) have a panel of clinical experts review and confirm all incident and mortal cancers and verify all causes of death; (4) continue storage of all existing blood samples collected during the Nutrition Intervention Trials in freezers at -85 degrees Centigrade, and provide a record of daily freezer and ambient temperatures in the freezer storage room for the duration of the new contract period; (5) with NCI develop a protocol and conduct a short-term nutrition supplementation study using varying doses and combinations of selenium and vitamin E to evaluate mechanisms relevant to carcinogenesis; (6) perform Case-Cohort/Nested Case-Control Studies of selected biochemical and genetic hypotheses.  The efforts from this contract will permit continued stuffy of trial participants to better understand the etiology of upper gastrointestinal cancer and strategies for prevention.  The Nutrition Intervention Trials are two double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized intervention studies conducted in Linxian to evaluate multiple vitamins/minerals in the prevention of esophageal and other cancers.  Beginning in 1985, the Dysplasia Trial evaluated 3,318 persons with cytologic evidence of dysplasia supplemented for six years while the General population Trial evaluated 29,584 persons supplemented for 5 ¼ years.  Biologic specimens were collected periodically throughout the trials and stored at CICAMS.  Post-prevention follow-up has continued since 1991.  Because the Nutrition Intervention Trials were conducted in China by CICAMS and the blood samples are in China at CICAMS, the continued follow-up must be conducted in China by CICAMS.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source because no study population exists in the United States.  Authority: 41 U.S.C.253(c) (1), as set forth in FAR 6.30201.  See numbered note 22.  No phone calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Lakehurst, NJ is seeking potential sources for advanced wiring diagnostic/prognostic Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) options for upgrading the existing wire harness testing capabilities throughout the NAVAIR Warfighter Organizational (O) and Intermediate (I) Level maintenance communities.  Only non-developmental items will be considered.  Responses to this RFI will be evaluated for applicability to both the O and I maintenance levels.  Although future procurement potential exists, this activity is conducting market research only, in connection with this RFI.

The desired COTS unit will be portable (easily carried/luggable by personnel), user friendly and consist of all hardware and software to permit the equipment to be fully functional.  Respondents to this RFI may provide catalogs, drawings/illustrations, technical manuals, training description/material, calibration requirements (if any), recommended spare parts list, warranty, life cycle (ten year) technical and parts support, maintenance plans, test documentation, brochures, catalog pricing and/or any other documentation that describes the company’s capability to manufacture and support the equipment of the type described in this announcement.  The information provided shall describe the COTS system as it relates to System Requirements and Critical Parameters below.  Supporting documentation is requested as applicable.

System Requirements:
	
1.	Maintain existing Fleet TPS interface:
Software: 	The system shall have the capability of importing comma delineated ASCII formatted files, maintaining operational integrity with no testing performance degradation.
Hardware: 	The system shall provide interface with existing TPS adapter cables using tester connector part number: MS27656T23B35S.

2.	Integration of synthetic instrumentation: Instrumentation shall be compatible with COTS software suites (such as LabView) that allows easy updates/integration of additional COTS instrumentation technologies 

3.	Interface for integration of new test technologies: The system shall have external interfaces (e.g. USB, RS-232, Ethernet, PCM/CIA) to allow for future “Plug and Play” instrumentation integration.

4.	Provide automated switching up to 1000 test points. This requirement can be fulfilled by a single interface panel with 1000 test points or through “daisy chaining” of boxes to achieve the required test points.  

Critical parameters:
The equipment must be able to detect and locate conductor opens and shorts, degraded signal paths, and insulation damage on various wire types including: insulated stranded conductors, twisted shielded/unshielded, triaxial, and tri-twisted shielded/unshielded wire types.  

1.	Performance/Test Capabilities and Documentation
·	In order to analyze wiring for entire avionics and electrical systems, the equipment must provide: 
o	Programmable testing parameters
o	Automatic generation of point-to-point wiring configuration files based on known good conductive path measurements
§	Preferred: Automatic generation of wiring schematics based on external software applications and/or known good conductive path measurements.
o	An automated switching matrix to provide up to 1000 test points. 
§	Preferred: High bandwidth switching to permit effective use of diagnostics methods such as TDR/FDR/SWR.
o	Measurement functionalities
§	Insulation breakdown/integrity
§	Resistance (0 ohm < 1 Gohm nominal) 
§	Capacitance (10pF < 1mF nominal) 
o	Storage of test results for diagnostic/prognostic evaluation. 

2.	Technical Documentation: 
a.	Setup and operation 
b.	Repair processes
c.	Available training media

3.	Size and Weight: Due to the varied operating environments, it is requested that respondents provide dimensional and weight information of their system(s) in basic and 1000 test point configurations. Please include: 
a.	Overall dimensions
b.	Total foot print
c.	Total Cube space
d.	Overall weight (basic and 1000 test point configuration)

Additional Considerations:
1.	Provide a description of latent / intermittent fault detection methods that are available, or can be incorporated into the tester.  The inclusion of technologies that target “soft faults” such as wire insulation chafes, nicks, cracks, etc., and intermittent faults is a desirable feature.

2.	Describe measurement capabilities as related to single-ended and dual-ended testing techniques.  Since many testing applications do not allow for access to every end of the conductive path, making measurements from one end only is a desirable feature.  Dual /multi-ended access is also necessary for complete point-to-point wiring data verification.

3.	Describe branched-circuit testing methods.  Troubleshooting becomes much more complex when the conductive path splits or branches.  Techniques to isolate faults in the branches of these circuits are desirable.


It is requested that respondents identify Government and/or Commercial customers currently using this equipment for the intended purpose of the equipment.  Please provide customer point of contact, including a telephone number, e-mail address or web site, quantities sold along with dates sold, and a description of the unit(s).  

If providing information electronically, please ensure that the information is compatible and accessible using Microsoft Office 98 software.  

This announcement is not a formal solicitation and is not a request for proposal.  No contract will be awarded from this announcement.  No reimbursement will be made of any costs to provide information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests.  Availability of any formal solicitation will be announced under a separate announcement.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Each response must reference the “Request for Information” title.

<DESC>The COUNTERINTELLIGENCE FIELD ACTIVITY (CIFA) is seeking sources to support a possible acquisition for undertaking a study to address efforts to evaluate Voice Stress Analysis (VSA) Devices with respect to their effectiveness (validity and reliability) in determinations of truthfulness and deception in spoken words and statements.  In support of this effort the 6th Contracting Squadron (6 CONS) at Macdill AFB issues this Sources Sought Synopsis for information and planning purposes only.  This Synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the government nor will the Government pay for any information solicited.  The purpose of this Sources Sought is to identify potential sources that are interested in and capable of performing the work described herein.  Acknowledgment of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of 6 CONS/CIFAS evaluation of the information received.  As a result of this Sources Sought 6 CONS may issue a Solicitation/Request for Proposal (RFP).  However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against 6 CONS or CIFA shall arise as a result of a response to this Sources Sought (e.g., use of such information as either part of its evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement).  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:  The contractor shall evaluate the effectiveness of two VSA Instruments with respect to their ability to detect “stress” and “deception” in monosyllabic and/or polysyllabic speech (from humans) during interviews/interrogations carried out in specified testing sessions under scientifically controlled simulations of real-life conditions.  The determination of effectiveness will lie in the ability of VSA Instruments to distinguish between truthful and deceptive subjects and between truthful and deceptive utterances in conditions of “blind” analyses.  The contractor shall conduct this effort in two phases to meet the primary scope and objectives.  Phase I: Standardization/Assessment of Voice-based Measures of Deception [Approximately 4-5 months]. The contractor will develop a set of methodologies (i.e., testing and data collection strategies) and materials (e.g., voice samples collected in specified conditions) that will provide a GOLD STANDARD for evaluating voice-based measures of deception.  Phase II: Evaluation of VSA Instruments. During the last 7-8 months of contract performance, the contactor(s) shall evaluate the selected VSA Instruments and draft independent reports of each device tested.  The total performance period of the Study is estimated at twelve (12) months.  QUALIFICATIONS:  The Contractor will have a “Demonstrable Record” of scientific and technical expertise in acoustics, speech, or voice stress analysis.  A “Demonstrable Record” would include peer-reviewed publications, technical reports, or government reports that relate to acoustics, speech, or voice stress analysis.  Please submit a vitae or publication list and submit [up to 3 of the listed publications] in electronic form.  “Demonstrable Record” should be no more than 20 pages.  Also, please provide current technical capabilities (i.e., lab space and equipment).  SUMMARY:  To assess the potential for VSA Instruments as a method of detecting “stress,” specifically that known to be associated with deception.  The results of the study would allow for the Department of Defense and other agencies to determine if there is a science-based body of evidence to support the use of VSA instrumentation within the Federal Government.  The study would not result in the replacement or substitution for the existing system of psychophysiological detection of deception or traditional polygraph testing process.  SUBMITTAL INFORMATION:  Qualified Interested Offerors must respond electronically to Ms. Crossland at cardin.crossland@macdill.af.mil within14 calendar days from the date of publication.  NO PHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED.  Qualified Interested Offerors must state whether they are a Small Business (SB), Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Woman-owned Small Business (WOSB), Historically Black College or University or Minority Institution (HBCU/MI), an 8(a) firm, a Native American firm, a HUBZone firm, a Veteran-Owned Small Business Concern, a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Concern, a participant in the Very Small Business Pilot Program, an Educational Institution, or a large business based on the size standard above.  The government reserves the right to set this acquisition aside for any of the above type organizations based on the responses received.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division intends to issue a Request for Proposal from the Distributed Common Ground System-Navy Program Office for a common geopositioning software toolset (hereafter known as the Common Geopositioning (CGS) Services Project), during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2004, with a contract award planned for the second quarter of fiscal year 2005.   The CGS Project is the initial step in the migration to a single common geopositioning services “engine” for all services.  CGS will be capable of supporting the precise geopositioning needs of present and future precision guided munitions, within the deliberate and time sensitive targeting (TST) timelines. The CGS Project described in this sources sought will include development of the following modular capabilities/functions:
1)	Common Geopositioning Services (CGS) Engine.  
2)	Integrated COTS Mono/Stereo Viewer(s).  
3)	API to the CGS GOTS Engine (to be used by other COTS ELT vendors to add CGS capabilities to their product, if desired). 
4)	DCGS Integration Backbone (DIB) API for third party vendors.  
      5)  All CGS software must operate in a WINDOWS and UNIX software environment and be user installable on all equipment that meet the Services defined minimum hardware/software system configuration requirements.  The exact configurations will depend on specific user systems on which the software is installed.  

The Government anticipates a single cost plus incentive fee type contract  (with exception of the Low-end Mono/Stereo Viewer package(s) which may be licensed as COTS products) will be awarded to the winning offeror.  Potential offerors will be required to have U.S citizen staff personnel with TS/SCI clearances and facility and storage capability in accordance with the NISPOM (DOD 5520.22-M) by contract award. 
Additionally, the Government will host an Industry Day on July 29, 2004 in Patuxent River, Maryland.  The purpose of Industry Day is to provide an overview of the CGS Project, current acquisition plan, and to answer any contractor questions regarding the CGS Project.  Companies desiring to participate in Industry Day should fax their request to the Contracting Office: Ms. Carol Montgomery at 732 323-4069.

CGSP draft specifications will include RFP Sections L & M,  Statement of Objectives (SOO), and Technical Requirements Document(TRD). Draft documentation  will appear on the NAVAIR web site  (WWW.NAVAIR.NAVY.MIL)five days prior to Industry Day.
 
Information from Industry Day may or may not be incorporated into the Request for Proposal/technical specifications.   This synopsis is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a request for proposals, nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  The Government will not compensate the respondent for any cost incurred in developing any information associated with Industry Day.

The US Army Avi ation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) is soliciting information on technology applicable to the detection of small arms fire from aviation platforms.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS and is not considered to be a comm itment by the Government.  The Government does not intend to enter any type of contractual arrangement on the basis of this notification or otherwise pay for any information submitted.  It is part of a technology survey to assist in the planning of possibl e future programs.  Informal or white paper responses are encouraged.  Currently, the AMRDEC is evaluating sensors technologies for the detection and identification of small arms fire from Army air vehicles. State-of-the-art sensor technologies have demons trated the ability to detect, identify and locate small arms threats at long ranges, very accurately. But issues still exist with the integration and application of these technologies on airborne platforms.  Information is being requested on sensor technol ogies that can provide demonstrated, measured performance. Sensor technologies will be evaluated based on, but not limited to, the following criteria:  1. Ability to detect small arms fire beyond the weapon's effective range.  2. Ability to discriminate di fferent classes of small arms fire. (i.e. .30 Cal vs. .50 Cal).  3. Capability of the sensor to locate small arms fire.  4. Maturity and cost of the sensor technology.  5. Field-of-view/resolution requirements to provide 360 degree coverage of an airborne platform.  6. Suitability of the technology to be integrated on an airborne platform.  7. Capability to support demonstration efforts.  The AMRDEC may potentially conduct tower and/or captive flight tests of small arms detection and identification sensors during the third and fourth quarter of calendar year 2004. Based on the responses relating to the above criteria and hardware availability, one or more sensor technologies may be invited to participate in these tests.  All responses will be considered, pro vided they address their capabilities in the areas set forth above.

<SUBJECT>National Electric Grid Monitoring System - Sources Sought
<DESC>The Government anticipates contracting for services to implement a National  Electric Grid Monitoring System (NEGMS) based on two initiatives proposed  between the U.S Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and portions of the  electric utility industry.  The two initiatives consist of a near  real-time  portion of the system requiring manual entry of data and a real-time  portion of  the system using automated data entry.  This project seeks to finalize the  design concepts of these two initiatives, provide a detailed design for  both,  and to implement at least an initial phase of both these initiatives  including  the initial installation of the system.  A key component to achieving  these  goals will be the ongoing collaboration among key electric sector  organizations, the Government, and the Contractor for this effort. The purpose of the system is to aid the DHS in maintaining a situational  awareness of the state of the nation's electrical grid and to share this  information with the electricity sector.  This system will initially  operate  between the DHS and a limited number of the North American Electric  Reliability  Council (NERC) Reliability Coordinator (RC) Region sites. The concept for the near real-time portion of the NEGMS is for personnel  at  each individual participating RC site to manually enter via a computer  monitor  information into a preformatted spreadsheet  The spreadsheet will use this  information to automatically characterize the condition or "status" of the  RC  Region's grid.  This spreadsheet information and the "status" condition  for  each participating RC region will be communicated to and stored at the  DHS.  Each participating RC region will also have access to the spreadsheet and  "status" information for each RC region via access to DHS.  Visualization  capabilities will be provided at DHS in the form of maps with graphical  information.  The visualization information will also be available at the  RC  sites via access to DHS.  A selective text messaging capability will exist  between DHS and the RC sites. The concept for the real-time portion of the NEGMS is to provide DHS with  various electrical system indices calculated from selected raw electrical  system data for each participating RC region.  The indices will serve the  purpose of providing information to DHS to characterize the state of the  grid  in presentation formats that are easy to understand and interpret.  An RC  NEGMS  Server function will be developed for use at each RC site to obtain the  raw  data from the RC's Energy Management System (EMS) server.  The RC NEGMS  Server  function will be capable of accepting and converting the RC's EMS  vendor-specific data into an open mainstream data format for use by the  real-time system.  The server function will also derive from the data the  various electrical indices that will be used to characterize the "status"  of  the RC Region's grid.  The development of these indices and the "status"  values  will be determined using algorithms the contractor will develop or  finalize in  collaboration with the Government and the participating RCs.  These RC  indices  and "status" values will be communicated to DHS via a system  communications  network and stored there for use by DHS personnel.  Visualization  capabilities,  which will probably include displaying and trending of various indices  superimposed on a map, will be developed for use at DHS.  Similar to the  near-real time portion of NEGMS these indices and visual information for  each  participating RC will be available to each participating RC through access  to  the "database" at DHS.  This portion of the system will also have a  selective  text messaging capability between DHS and the RC sites. Additional NEGMS system functions will be required to be available at DHS  to  effectively utilize data such as a functional application to allow for  additional inference and index calculations to be performed at DHS based  on all  information available at DHS.  This may include information not obtained  through the NEGMS. The Contractor should be capable of designing a NEGMS to facilitate future  modifications and additions with relative ease including the expandability  of  system functions and applications and the ability to meet increased  bandwidth  requirements.  This implies a strong preference for the use of industry  standard approaches (e.g., protocols, data formats, widely used commercial  database management systems, openly accessible interfaces, languages,  etc.) and  an avoidance of proprietary solutions.  The system will comply with NERC  Cyber  Security Standards as a minimum.  The contractor will also provide system  testing and training. The purpose of this announcement is to determine the capabilities and  interest  from organizations of all sizes, including small businesses or  combinations of  small businesses, that have the requisite breadth and depth of experience  and  capabilities in the various technical, engineering, security, acquisition,  business, and other disciplines that would be needed to successfully  implement  the NEGMS.  Organizations deeming themselves qualified are requested to  provide  a brief description of their capabilities and experience in these or  related  areas. The information provided should specifically address the following points:  1)  Whether or not the organization has qualified and relevant staff with  Government security clearance(s).  If it does, please specify at what  security  level and with what Government agency(ies); 2) The organization's  experience in  performing work for Government agencies, particularly the DHS, including  the  nature of the work and how the experience may be relevant to the specific  capabilities necessary to perform this project; 3) The organization's  experience in performing work for the electric utility sector,  particularly for  any of the NERC Reliability Coordinator Regions, including the nature of  the  work and how the experience may be relevant to the specific capabilities  necessary to perform this project; 4) The organization's experience in  designing and implementing a system that required the demonstration of  similar  capabilities to those necessary to perform the project described in this  document; 5) The organization's expertise related to the nation's  electrical  transmission grid including its understanding of the importance and  interrelationship of various grid parameters to each other and to the  proper  functioning of the electrical grid.  This knowledge is important for  engaging  with industry in discussions regarding the relevance of the information  being  provided through the NEGMS to meeting both Government's and industry's  needs  and for exploring methods for making the "initial phase" effort more  effective  including the development of relevant indicators for the status of the  electrical grid; 6)Any other information the organization deems relevant  to  demonstrating its overall capabilities to successfully perform this entire  project. In addition to the information identified above, all responses must  include the  name and address of the responding organization, the name and contact  information for a contact person within that organization, and a statement  of  the organization's size status and any applicable socio-economic  designations,  i.e.  8(a) small business, HUBzone small business, etc. THIS REQUEST IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS BUT MERELY A REQUEST FOR  INFORMATION. Responses should be submitted in MS Word format, not to  exceed  five (5) pages in length, be single spaced with 1" margins (top, bottom,  left,  right), and when printed should fit on size 8 1/2" by 11" paper.  The type  must  be legible and not smaller than 10 point.  You are discouraged from  including  large pictures or charts in your response. An e-mail message containing  the  Word file as an attachment must be submitted to the Contract Specialist,  Keith  Carrington, at keith.carrington@netl.doe.gov no later than Thursday, July  22,  2004.  The Government has determined that the technical information  included in  this notice is sufficient in detail for an organization to determine  whether or  not it possesses the capabilities to meet these requirements.  Therefore,  questions of a technical nature are discouraged as it is anticipated that  no  additional technical information will be made available for this  requirement at  this time.

<CONTACT>Neha Dhir, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 496-6546, Fax (301) 402-0642, Email dhirn@mail.nlm.nih.gov - Karen Riggs, Contracting Officer, Phone 301 496-6546, Fax 301 402-0642, Email kr33v@nih.gov
<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to negotiate on a sole source basis under authority of FAR 6.302 with the College of American Pathologists (CAP), a not-for-profit Illinois corporation with offices in Northfield, Illinois, for SNOMED CT©  consulting services.  The period of performance for this purchase order is for one year with three successive one-year option periods.

NLM previously contracted with the CAP for a perpetual U.S.-wide license for its SNOMED CT vocabulary.  With advice from the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics, the cross-agency Consolidated Health Informatics (CHI) eGov initiative has designated SNOMED CT as one of a number of U.S. government-wide clinical data standards.  It is a major Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) priority to promote the adoption and use of these standards throughout the U.S.  To this end, HHS has given the NLM responsibility for funding, coordinating, and/or performing mappings between SNOMED CT and other important vocabularies (including those designated as administrative standards under the provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)) and for working to align clinical vocabulary and messaging standards.  The National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics (NCVHS) and HHS have assigned a particularly high priority to the creation of robust mappings between SNOMED CT and several other vocabularies, including CPT, ICD-9-CM, ICD-10-CM, MedDRA, and Medcin.

Under this acquisition, the CAP shall (1) support development, review, and testing of mappings between SNOMED CT and other vocabularies; (2) define, jointly with other vocabulary producers, the boundaries and relationship between SNOMED CT and other U.S. Government-wide vocabulary standards; (3) review and revise as appropriate proposals for alignment of HL7 code sets and implementation guides with SNOMED CT; and (4) perform related content analysis or revision tasks that will promote broader deployment of SNOMED CT in U.S. health data systems. 

The CAP is uniquely qualified to offer the above services.  The CAP is the producer and copyright holder of SNOMED CT and, therefore, the authority on the meaning and intended usage of SNOMED CT, on the current content and structure of this large and complex vocabulary, and on future plans for its development and extension.  The CAP’s involvement in any project that relates SNOMED CT to other standards ensures that the results are definitive and credible.  The CAP is the only organization with the authority to make changes to SNOMED CT content which may be required should the definitions of relationships between SNOMED CT and other standards require alterations or adjustments in the SNOMED CT content.  

This service will be solicited using FAR Part 12 (Acquisition of Commercial Items) procedures and awarded using FAR Part 13 (Simplified Acquisitions).  

This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all interested parties may submit a capabilities statement which will be considered by the NLM.  The capabilities statement should demonstrate that the interested party is able to provide the professional technical services as specified above.  All capabilities statements received in response to this notice will be evaluated based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Experience in creating and interpreting the content of SNOMED CT and 2) ability to effect changes in the content of SNOMED CT in response to requirements identified during the process of relating SNOMED CT to other standards.
 
Responses are required within 15 (fifteen) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  NLM synopsis No. 04-163/NSD shall be noted on all correspondence to this announcement.  Inquiries regarding this procurement may be made to Neha Dhir on 301-496-6546.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation CC-04-HQ-Q-0027 is issued as a Request for Quote. This solicitation incorporates the provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circulars 22 and 23, effective 5/5/04.  The National American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541110 (Offices of Lawyers) with a related small business size standard of $6.0M.  This requirement is NOT a small-business set-aside. The OCC intends to award a Blanket Purchase Agreement(BPA)for a period of 12 months, during which advice may be sought on specific issues. The BPA will establish a not-to-exceed ceiling against which hours may be billed at the hourly rate specified in the agreement. The OCC anticipates establishing a BPA ceiling of approximately $40,000.  Upon receipt and review of an issue, the contractor will provide a fixed price for conducting research and rendering of a legal opinion. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has a need for general guidance on how to comply with federal tax laws in the area of travel and specific advice on OCC employees’ travel patterns and the deductibility or non-deductibility of travel reimbursements.  The OCC’s nationwide staff of examiners conducts on-site reviews of national banks and provides sustained supervision of bank operations. Many OCC employees travel on a regular basis from their homes and/or duty stations in performance of their official duties. For example, if an employee travels to the same location 60% of the time and his travel expenses are reimbursed, what are the tax consequences for the employee and the OCC?  Specifically, 1) Where is the employee’s tax home? 2) Does the payment for travel constitute a deductible expense or taxable compensation? 3) Is there a general rule to determine when payment constitutes compensation vs. deductible expense? 4) Other specific questions to be presented as calls against the BPA. Written opinions will be required.  The opinion should include a general overview of the applicable tax statutes, regulations, judicial and administrative decisions, bulletins, and notices. Offerors must have extensive experience working the tax statutes and regulations and providing tax advice on the deductibility and non-deductibility of employee travel expenses.  Interested offerors must submit a resume of the firm, statement of the firm’s relevant experience within the past three years working on tax issues related to travel, resumes of individuals who will perform the work, a minimum of three references associated with the relevant experience within the past three years (contact information, including email address) and an hourly rate.  Individuals performing work must have a juris doctor from an accredited law school. Utilizing simplified acquisition procedures, offerors will be evaluated on past performance, relevancy of experience and price.  When combined, past performance and experience are more important than price.  The OCC will make an award to the offeror that provides the best value to the agency, price and technical factors considered.  FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors—Commerical, applies to this acquisition.  Offerors must include with their submission a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications—Commercial Items. Additionally, the clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions—Commercial Items, applies to the acquisition.  The applicable provisions and clauses may be viewed at http://www.arnet.gov/far. Offers are due by 2:00 pm ET on Thursday,July 8, 2004. The OCC reserves the right to make multiple awards; however,the intent is to select a single company. Written responses via electronic transmission to Marguerite.Brown@occ.treas.gov are preferred. Written offers may also be sent to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Acquisition Management Division, 250 E Street, SW, Mail Stop 4-13, Washington, DC 20219, Attn:  Marguerite G. Brown.  All hand-carried and courier-delivered quotes must be taken to the OCC loading dock at the East end of the building at 250 E Street, SW, Washington, DC.  The security guard will request identification and provide additional instructions and directions to the Mail and Messenger Unit window.

The services shall be issued via delivery orders and are in support of Shipyard availabilities.    It is essential that the proper skill level of Electricians be supplied for each individual order placed under the resulting contract.

The offeror(s) shall document their ability to supply Electricians/Lead Electricians in accordance with the Required Technical Qualifications set forth as follows:  Required Technical Qualifications – All Electricians/Lead Electricians provided must possess a basic knowledge of most phases of the electrical trade including theory, practice, codes, and the proper and safe use of electrical tools and equipments.

Proposal Preparation Instructions: Technical Proposal: The offeror shall submit a technical proposal that documents the marine qualifications of the Electricians/Lead Electricians that they commit to supply under any resulting contract.    A proposal that merely states that the workers will meet all the requirements of the solicitation may be rejected as technically unacceptable.    Any offer submitted shall include details of the types of experience, including marine experience, that will be supplied as Electricians/Lead Electricians.    The proposal shall also include details that confirm that the offeror is capable of supplying as many as two (2) qualified Marine Electricians and a Lead Marine Electrician within six (6) days of receipt of a delivery order.    Past Performance: Offeror shall supply at least one (1) relevant marine shipyard recommendation for past performance evaluation purposes.

The Government estimates that there will be a need for approximately 3,000 hours, including overtime  (2,400 hrs/Electrician, 600 hours Lead Electrician) of services required during the period of performance for this contract.    These are estimated hours only and are not a representation to an offeror or contractor that they will be required or ordered, or that conditions affecting requirements will be stable or normal.  Conditions may change and there may be a need for significantly less or more hours.    Proposed rates shall be fixed and shall remain fixed throughout the period of performance.    CLIN 0003 - Travel, if required, will be reimbursed in accordance with Joint Federal Travel Regulations (JFTR) on a time & materials basis.  This is only travel that may be required under a task order issued by the Coast Guard.

Electricians/Lead Electricians shall be entered into the Coast Guard YARD’s Time & Attendance system.

On days of inclement weather, contractor shall call the Coast Guard Inclement Weather Hotline at (410) 636-7910, Option 1.  If the recording announces that the U.S. Coast Guard YARD is closed, contractor shall NOT report to the YARD and WILL NOT be compensated for that day.  In the event that the contractor reports to the YARD and is sent home (inclement weather, no work, etc.), contractor shall receive a minimum of two (2) hours compensation at the standard rate at which they are authorized under the agreement.   FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999) and the following addenda:  Proposal Evaluation: The Government will evaluate all offers to be qualified for award as follows: If it is determined in the best interest of the Government, the Government reserves the right to make more than one award in response to this solicitation.    The Government will review each proposal submitted in response to this solicitation and make award to the offeror who submits the best proposal for supplying personnel with the qualifications listed above.    The Government will consider price as a factor in the evaluation, but the contractor’s technical qualifications and capability to provide a number of marine electricians are more important.    Past Performance information will also be considered but it is less important than price.   Technical is more important than price and past performance combined.   The experience will be evaluated for its relevancy and should be recent.    Marine shipyard experience is required.  Proposals not meeting this requirement may be determined unacceptable.  The evaluated price will be obtained by multiplying the estimated number of hours times the relevant labor category rate.    The two labor category totals will then be added together to achieve a final price for evaluation purposes.  The overtime rates will be multiplied by 500 for Electricians and 100 for the Lead Electricians.    The totals for those two categories will then be added to the total for the straight time rate to achieve a final evaluated price.  Price evaluation will be performed by the Contracting Officer to determine the reasonableness of each proposed price and to determine the Offeror’s understanding of the work and ability to perform the contract.  The Government reserves the right to make an award without discussions.  This requirement will be awarded on an all or none basis.

    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of Public Law 107–296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

    (1)  The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held— 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107–296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships, which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled, as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. 
    (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296 of November 25, 2002.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

This procurement is unrestricted therefore all responsible sources may submit a proposal and a best value evaluation will be performed. The Scope of Work (SOW) includes Jet Service from an International Airport within the Southwest Region (Dallas Texas, Denver Colorado) to Roswell, New Mexico with the flight originating at the International Airport, flying directly to Roswell and making the direct return flight to the International Airport from Roswell in accordance with the below schedule. The Aircraft proposed must accommodate a minimum of 120 passengers, must meet the industry standard for commercial flights with the exception of beverage/snack service and be in compliance with all FAA inspections, regulations and safety requirements for a commercial airliner. Each flight must originate and end from a gate within a secure domestic flight area of the airport allowing incoming/outgoing passengers to make connections with the Charter Flight or their departing flights without leaving the secure domestic flight area. The Charter Flight must be listed within the scheduling system of the airline allowing for those who are making reservations to view and confirm their reservations. The airline will also post the flight on all monitors within the International Air Port displaying the departure and arrival gate and times. The airline must provide for baggage transfer so as that the passenger has the same type of service as if they were on the domestic carriers’ regular scheduled flights. The flight schedule will be each week on Sunday and will be accomplished between the following times from each site: Denver: Depart Denver prior to 1:00p.m. MDT/Arrive back to Denver no later than 4:00 p.m. MDT//Dallas: Depart Dallas prior to 1:30 p.m. CDT/Arrive back to Dallas no later than 4:00 p.m. CDT. The airline must provide for check in service at the domestic area of the International Airport. The FLETC will provide a manifest to the airline each Friday no later than 4:00 p.m. MDT. If there is space available, then any government employee on official travel may provide proper identification and travel orders at the gate and the airline will allow that individual to travel. The FLETC in conjunction with the Transportation Security Administration will provide security screening for all students departing from Roswell to the International Airport selected. The FLETC will also provide for the loading of baggage at the Roswell Airport on to the return flight, however this only relates to the placing of the bags from the secure area to the aircraft. The Airline will be responsible for securing all baggage within the hold and is responsible for all damage after it is placed inside the aircraft. The airline will provide for all fuel services at both locations and will be responsible for licenses, fees or tariffs associated with the operation of the flights. Regarding evaluation of proposal, interested parties are informed that even though price is an important selection criteria, a best value determination will be made based upon the offer that best meets the following technical and past performance factors and will be made in accordance with FAR provision 52.212-2 - Evaluation - Commercial Items. A go/no go technical factor will be used to assure that the offeror can meet the required safety and insurance requirements of the airline industry. The offerors proposal shall state the minimum safety and insurance requirements that are required by law and shall provide information that they meet these requirements. The proposal must also provide documentation verifying the offerors compliance with the safety and insurance requirements.  Failure to submit the proper documents showing that the offeror meets these requirements will exclude the offeror from consideration. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offerers in descending order of importance: (1) the offerors ability to meet the requirements in the SOW; (2) the offerors strategy to meet scheduled arrival and departure times given the availability of aircraft, flightworthiness of aircraft, etc; (3) an evaluation of past performance; and (4) price. Technical and past performance, when combined, is of significantly higher importance than price in this evaluation.
