<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial item prepared in accordance with FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number 08-3k47-04, is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ), and incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-24.  USDA, ARS, BARC has an requirement for an X-ray fluorescence spectrometer for use in the analysis of solid and liquid manure, soils, plants, and their liquid extracts by Energy Dispersive X-ray  fluorescence (ED-XRF). ED-XRF must allow for the macro analysis of multiple elements while leaving the sample intact for further chemical and microanalysis. The NAICS Code is 334516 with a small business standard of 500 employees. The Government intends to award on a sole source basis to Spectro Analytical Instruments, Inc. pursuant to FAR Subpart 6.3.   Inside delivery is required to FOB destination to the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, Beltsville, Maryland, 20705-2350, within 180 days of award. Inspection and Acceptance will be performed at Building 306 BARC-East Beltsville, Maryland. The analyzer must meet the following minimum criteria:

 Line item 01  Limits of detection: P: 20 ppm or lower, Al, Fe, K: 30 ppm or lower, Ca: 15 ppm or lower,  Mg:  50 ppm or lower, Na: 100 ppm or lower and limits of detection less than one (1)  ppm   for  trace elements of atomic number higher than above elements in soil, plant, and manure samples with minimal preparation. Critical user-specific analyses must include phosphorus, magnesium, aluminum, iron, and calcium in liquid and/or solid manure, soils, and plants, and their liquid extracts. The accuracy of the analytical results are of critical 
importance in the environmental phosphorus fate research in the Animal Manure and By-Products Laboratory.

 Line item 02 Instrument Specifications: The analyzer must have automated multi-sample analysis capabilities, sample size (sample cell) of 10 square mm or greater for larger sample analysis and a sample chamber operable under conditions to improve low energy fluorescent X-ray performance i.e. Vacuum or inert gas purging. The analyzer must have an excitation X-ray source of 400 watts or greater and fluorescent X-ray detection optimized for measurements at the specifications above, with a low thermal 
loading of liquid and solid samples.

Line item 03 The analyzer must have automated individual sample matrix correction and background noise minimization to compensate for irregularities found in manure suspensions, manure solids, soil and plant samples for enhanced analytical sensitivity.
 Control software must be able to operate under Windows TM 2000 or XP and produce user-accessible files of spectral data in text file format.

Line item 04 The analyzer must be supplied with a one-year or 
longer warranty on parts and labor and must also include installation, on-site start-up assistance, and training supplied by factory-trained personnel.

Line item 05 Because screening analysis of manure and soils are to be performed, all the matrix effects must be taken into account.  The method utilized must be the polarized X-ray radiation for exciting the elements in the sample in addition to the fundamental parameters method.  Due to the strength of the polarization automatic matrix correction based on Compton backscattering using a molybdenum (Mo) secondary target is necessary.  Because heterogeneity of manure suspensions is a common occurrence in research samples, automatic individualized matrix correction and background noise minimization are critically necessary to compensate for matrix irregularities inherent to liquid manure suspensions, manure solids, and ground soil amended with manures to provide enhanced analytical sensitivity. The following FAR clauses and provisions apply:  FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation Commercial Items.Award to a technically acceptable offeror, at a fair and reasonable price; The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers in order of importance: 1. price  2. technical capability of the item and  3. past performance .

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to issue Request for Proposals (RFP) No. 514-05-011 on or about 02/02/2005 for an anticipated five year cost plus fixed-fee completion type contract.  The proposed effort is a product of USAID/Colombia’s Agriculture and Alternative Development Office (AADO) under the “Additional Investment for Sustainable Alternative Development Program” (or Más Inversión para el Desarrollo Alternativo Sostenible) (MIDAS).  The ceiling amount of USAID funding over the anticipated five year term of this effort is currently set at $160,000,000, and will depend on the availability of funding.

The Government of Colombia (GOC) has undertaken an integrated effort that has substantially driven the illegal armed groups out of the more populated parts of Colombia, and the proposed effort will focus upon galvanizing strategic private sector response capacity to the economic growth opportunities and challenges associated with a healthier macroeconomic setting and an integrated trade/investment environment.  AADO’s “Additional Investment for Sustainable Alternative Development” Program (Más Inversión para el Desarrollo Alternativo Sostenible (MIDAS)) is one of the primary vehicles designed to address these issues.  The Colombian private sector reflects a broad continuum of entities which range from large, sophisticated corporations owned by Colombian or multinational investors, as well as, entrepreneurs engaged in micro enterprise business ventures.  Each class of business entity has the potential to expand its operations and to create new job opportunities that will encourage the unemployed to avoid the entrapment of illicit activities. USAID’s goal under the proposed effort will be to provide small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) with strategic institution-building support programs designed to sustainably address the primary informational and market development barriers which until recently have limited SME growth potential in Colombia.

USAID/Colombia’s AADO has substantially identified both traditional strategies and innovative approaches that are designed to combine the alternative development and local government strengthening programs into a single, integrated activity, to be implemented by a single contractor or a consortium of firms.  AADO”s main challenge now is to determine the most cost effective way to consolidate the various on-going initiatives to achieve the Mission’s goal of sustainable reduction in the production of illicit drugs, and the promotion of peace in Colombia.  Illicit production has shifted from large scale production in extensive areas to small production units co-located in more populous areas with traditional crops, as well as, into protected national parks.  The Mission’s intention is that all of the disparate efforts to achieve the same ultimate objectives will be fully integrated under a single contract mechanism in order to maximize the potential positive synergies that tend to naturally evolve under strategic partnerships that are envisioned between the awardee, USAID/Colombia, GOC, and local and regional Colombian public and private organizations.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 541990.  The RFP will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities (FEDBIZOPPS) web page (www.fedbizopps.gov) not less than five (5) days after this notice is issued.  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 5.102, Availability of Solicitations, Paragraph (d), “AVAILABILITY OF THE RFP IS LIMITED TO THIS ELECTRONIC MEDIUM ONLY”.  Please direct related inquiries to USAID/Colombia/Acquisition & Assistance, Waymon A. Carroll, Contracting Officer at 571 423-6880x141/voice or electronic mail  USAIDColombia-AA@usaid.gov

JOINT VENTURE (J/V) DOCUMENTATION HAS TO BE COMPLETED AND SUBMITTED PRIOR TO CONTRACT AWARD.

Evaluation Factors/Criteria:

Special Note:  Price and all technical factors are equal.  (50% Price and 50% technical)

(1) Price 

  
(2) Past performance, experience and technical competence:  List 3 recent projects indicating past performance, experience and technical competence in constructing geogrid Reinforced Soil Slopes.  List a minimum of three (3) recent, relevant projects similar in complexity and magnitude to the Reinforced Soil Slope construction of the Kentucky Cold Hill Road/Fish Trap Road Project.  In addition, provide a customer/owner point of contact, phone number, and e-mail address if available.  Within the last ten years, has your firm ever been, or proposed to be, suspended, debarred, or determined non-responsible, based upon an allegation of unsatisfactory performance or fraud? Within the last ten years, has your firm ever had a contract terminated for any reason either as a prime or subcontractor?  This also applies to a partner in a joint venture. Within the last ten years, has your firm ever filed a claim relative to the construction of a roadway facility for (1) a default termination, (2) the imposition of liquidated damages, (3) a termination for convenience that adversely affected your firm, or (4) any damages caused by the owner’s determination that you did not perform in a timely, safe, or contractual manner.

The Government will review and evaluate each firm’s (offeror) documented past performance and will rate them as acceptable or unacceptable.  By acceptable past performance, the Government means that the offeror has a good reputation for satisfying its customers and delivering quality work in a timely manner at a reasonable cost. Acceptable past performance also means the firm has a reputation of integrity, reasonable and cooperative conduct, and commitment to customer satisfaction.  In reviewing and evaluating an offeror’s past performance, the Government will consider information obtained from the firm, and may consider information obtained from other sources.  This includes past and present customers and their current and former employees; past and present subcontractors and their current and former employees; current and former employees of the firm; federal, state and local government agencies (including court records), and private consumer protection organizations.  Offerors are strongly encouraged to provide information on problems encountered on identified contracts and annotate the firm’s corrective action taken.  The Government will evaluate past performance information and will rate the firms as pass or fail. In the event that a firm does not have a record of relevant past performance, or information on past performance is not available, the firm will not be evaluated favorable or unfavorably on this technical evaluation factor. Rather the offeror will be given a neutral rating. 

In accordance with FAR clause 252.215-1, Instructions to Offerors-Competitive Acquisition (MAR 2001), the Government will award after evaluations are completed, unless the Contracting Officer determines that discussions are necessary.

Due to changes in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) that adds the Annual Representations and Certifications FAR 52.204-8 (Jan 2005), the Representations and Certifications must be filled-in online at http://orca.bpn.gov/.  The required Annual Form Vets-100 must also be filled-in online at http://vets100.cudenver.edu/ per FAR 52.222-37.  Contractors are not eligible for award unless these requirements are satisfied.

IMPORTANT:  SUBCONTRACTING PLANS REQUIREMENT

A subcontracting plan is required from all “other than Small Business” when the project is expected to exceed $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction) [FAR 19.702].  The Contracting Officer, Contracting Officer Technical Representative and Small Business Specialist are responsible for approving a reasonable and realistic plan [FAR 19.705-4] [TAM 1219.201(e)(6)].

A Yellow rating indicates that the proposed solution contains strengths, but also significant weaknesses.  Red (Unacceptable)-The vendor’s proposal offers approaches/solutions that if implemented, would introduce excessive risk making it highly unlikely that performance would meet DISA objectives.  A Red rating indicates that the proposed solution, while maybe presenting some strengths, also contains significant weaknesses.  Factor 2, Past Performance: Blue- Highly relevant/very recent past performance in all identified past performance efforts; excellent performance ratings. Green- Relevant/somewhat recent past performance in all identified past performance efforts; acceptable performance ratings.  Yellow- Somewhat relevant/not very recent past performance; mostly acceptable performance ratings. Red-Little relevant past performance identified; almost all unacceptable performance ratings.

<DESC>The Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP), of the Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD), National Cancer Institute (NCI) is seeking organizations or consortiums with the capabilities and facilities to provide a resource for the conduct of Phase 2 and early clinical trials of NCI-sponsored agents, to evaluate biologic effects of these agents on their molecular targets, to evaluate other relevant biologic effects and to determine clinically relevant outcomes/correlates.  Major emphasis shall be on Phase 2 studies, pilot protocols that explore promising combination therapies, and high priority studies that are pivotal for drug development and require rapid initiation, completion, and data reporting.  NCI staff will notify the Contractor of high priority studies as they are identified.  The NCI will also consider investigator initiated trials for credit under this contract based on available resources and priorities. 

CTEP requires a total resource that will provide 1600 to 2000 patients accrued to 32 to 64 trials per year.  CTEP intends to make multiple contract awards. These contracts will require multi-institutional consortia of clinicians, statisticians, data managers, research nurses and others with early phase clinical trial expertise with investigational agents in cancer.  (It is unlikely, but not impossible, that a single institution could provide sufficient patients.)  Contractors must be organized to attract adequate patient cohorts for prompt completion of trials.  Contractors will have flexibility to reform consortial arrangements or subcontract with additional sites to meet accrual goals, enhance accrual of unusual patient populations, increase accrual rates for high priority trials and/or provide biologic/cellular pharmacology expertise for correlative studies. 

Offerors for these contracts must demonstrate that they have expertise in cancer drug development, knowledge in the clinical management of specific tumor types, phase 2 clinical trials, pharmacology and pharmacodynamics.  They need to provide evidence of their own expertise, or access to such expertise, in diagnostic and functional imaging, interventional radiology, pathology, and other potentially relevant laboratory methodologies. 

Offerors must either 1) document the accrual of at least 150 evaluable adult cancer patients to IRB approved Phase 2 trials by the investigators (including all sites in the consortium) during a recent 12-month period during the last two (2) years or 2) document sufficient access to a minimum of 1000 new patients in a recent twelve month period to ensure accrual of at least 150 patients per year.  Offerors must also document the completion and reporting of at least two Phase 2 trials completed at the offering institution/consortium during 2003-2004.

It is anticipated that up to eight awards will be made and that the resulting contracts will be awarded on an incrementally funded basis for a period of 3 years plus two additional option years .  RFP N01-CM-57018-16  will be issued on or about February 3, 2005.  The RFP will be available at the website of the Research Contracts Branch, NCI (http://rcb.cancer.gov/rcb-internet/).  The NAICS Code is 541710.  Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. Collect Calls NOT accepted.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to issue a sole source contract to Carleton Technologies (CT), Mississauga, Ontario for the acquisition of five (5) Viper E Underwater Breathing Apparatus (UBA) and two (2) MK 16 MOD 2 UBAs.  These Next-Generation Underwater Breathing Apparatus (NUBA)s are being acquired for test and evaluation purposes under the Foreign Comparative (FCT) test program.   The Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Group identifies the need for EOD forces to destroy and/or neutralize underwater mines.  The Mk 16 is currently fulfilling this need, but is doing so at a high cost to the Government and with increasingly reduced reliability.   The current system, the MK 16, is an aged design that has not benefited from modern manufacturing techniques to reduce part counts and increase reliability.  There is a need for a UBA that is more cost effective and reliable than the MK 16.  A market survey was conducted using characteristics ge! nerated by a Requirements Working Group (RWG).  The RWG’s task was to identify and rank the most important UBA characteristics for the EOD diver.  Those characteristics were used to solicit information from industry for NUBAs.  Based on the information received from industry, the RWG recommends further evaluation of three alternative NUBAs.  Two of the three alternatives are the Viper E UBA and the MK 16 Mod 2 UBA both manufactured exclusively by Carleton Technologies.  These UBAs offer the greater state of the art in electronically controlled systems and more modern design and manufacturing that allow for fewer parts and easier maintenance.  Therefore these NUBAs are being acquired from Carleton Technologies for further evaluation.   Note 22 Applies

<DESC>The Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Division Newport, intends to award a Firm Fixed Price Contract on a Sole Source basis to Benthos, 49 Edgerton Drive, North Falmouth, MA 02556-2826 for the following items:  Model 867-A Shallow Water Transponding Release – Quantity 3 each and Model 866-A Continental Shelf Transponding Release – Quantity 9 each.  The Government intends to issue a request for written quote on or about 3 February 2005 to Benthos using FAR Part 12 and FAR Part 13.  The anticipated award date is 2005 February 16.  This action is being processed on a Sole Source basis to ensure interfacing requirements are met among old and new units.  The Benthos deck units are not compatible with outer manufacturer’s transponders.  To attempt to use another Company’s transponder products would require the Government to purchase another deck unit, thereby resulting in a duplication of previously expended costs and a reduction in compatibility.  Any Company that believes it has the capability to meet the Government’s minimum requirements is invited to submit a quote for Government evaluation.

<DESC>The Office of Research Services at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) seeks a contractor to perform an in-depth evaluation of the provision of research animal support services to the NIH intramural research community.  The goals of this evaluation are to develop a concept of operations for the provision of research animal support services to the NIH intramural program.  These services support the scientific mission of the NIH while balancing administrative, fiscal, space and regulatory constraints.

The two anticipated goals of this contract will be: (1) To develop and justify a concept of operations for the provision of research animal support services that best meets the many requirements of the intramural program, and (2) to recommend the roles, responsibilities, and authority of a possible Chief Veterinary Officer (CVO) charged with developing, implementing and coordinating the successful operation of the various components of animal care, and associated use, at the NIH.  The position of CVO does not currently exist and one aspect of this study is to determine whether such an individual is needed.

The successful contractor shall possess, and demonstrate in their proposal, knowledge of the NIH intramural research programs as well as familiarity with provisions and requirements of research animal support services.  Previous successful experience in the evaluation of large, multi-faceted programs is essential.

The solicitation document will be released on or about February 16 2005, with a due date of March 16, 2005. The planned contract award date is April 29, 2004.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 336391   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Climate Protection Partnerships Division (CPPD) intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Red Dot Corporation to do field testing of a prototypical direct-expansion off-road HFC-152a vehicle air-conditioning system. This effort is a continuation of testing that has already been completed by Red Dot. Specifically, Red Dot has completed testing, in a controlled environment, of both a standard air-conditioning system, HFC-134a, and a new air-conditioning system, HFC-152a. CPPD works with businesses,  organizations, governments, and consumers to reduce emissions of the greenhouse (GHG) gasses that contribute to global climate change by promoting greater use of energy efficient and other cost-effective technologies. One of the largest sources of GHG gas emissions is mobile air conditioning (MAC).  Off-road vehicles such as mining, construction, and agricultural equipment also use MAC, but have often been overlooked as a source of MAC-related GHG emissions. Currently, these off-road vehicles use HFC-134a refrigerant, which is a powerful GHG. Large reductions in GHG emissions would occur if  these off-road vehicles switched to a climate-friendlier air-conditioning refrigerant such as HFC-152a. In order to facilitate a transition to more climate-friendly refrigerant EPA must evaluate the alternatives. The objective of this project is to evaluate the most promising alternative off-road  MAC refrigerant. This refrigerant is HFC-152a. As a refrigerant itself, HFC-152a is better because it has a much lower global warming potential. HFC-152a may also provide equal or better energy efficiency to HFC-134a systems, resulting in lower indirect GHG from fuel consumption. Results of the  tests will be presented at future conferences and will help EPA facilitate the transition to climate-friendly MAC refrigerants, thereby helping the environment and advancing the goal of CPPD. The Red Dot Corporation is uniquely qualified to do this work because of their unique position in the  off-road air-conditioning industry and previous work testing the standard and new air-conditioning systems. Additionally, Red Dot has expertise, preparedness, location, credibility, and experience. Red Dot is one of the leading firms in the industry with nearly forty years of experience in the  mobile heating, ventilation, and cooling field. They are currently a leading manufacturer of HVAC products for the heavy vehicle industry. Their MAC systems are used in a variety of off-road vehicles, including: agriculture, marine, material handling, mining, rail maintenance, construction, crash,  fire & rescue, and forestry vehicles. Red Dot not only manufactures off-road MAC technology, they also do engineering design, advanced environmental unit and vehicle testing, and service personnel training for end users. This puts them in a unique position to speed new technology to the market.  They have experience with the new HFC-152a technology and have facilities needed to perform the test which will really test the durability and performance of this new off-road AC system. Additionally, they have facilities in an ideal location: Australia. Australia's harsh climate and dusty outback  make for a perfect experimental setting: they will really test the durability and performance of this new off-road AC system. Finally, Red Dot is recognized by the environmental programs of both the governments of the United States and of Australia, and are recognized by the Australia/US Climate  Action Plan. This is an important criterion for the validation of technical results. The NAICS code for this procurement will be 336391. NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE. Notwithstanding, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may  submit a response, which if received within 5 calendar days of the date of this announcement, will be considered. responses to this posting must be in writing. A determination not to the compete the proposed requirement based upon this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All  questions should be directed to Tom Semones via email at Semones.Tom@epa.gov.

<DESC>The Naval Sea System Command (NAVSEA) intends to contract with Oceaneering International, Inc. (OII) 501 Prince George's Boulevard, Upper Marlboro, MD 20774 for the effort required to plan, organize, control, coordinate and oversee all Systems Design, Engineering and Integration (SE&I) activities relating to the development, production, integration and testing of the Submarine Rescue System (SRS). In addition to its role as the SRS SE&I Agent, options will be included for OII to fabricate, test and deliver the Deck Transfer Lock (DTL), Gas Racks, Manway elements and other miscellaneous equipment for the Submarine Rescue System (SRS). OII has continually provided management and engineering support to the Navy since the inception of the Submarine Rescue Diving and Recompression System (SRDRS) Program. Award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of costs to the Government and create unacceptable delays in the U.S. Navy's ability to deliver a fully ca! pable SRS. Parties interested in potential subcontracting opportunities are encouraged to contact Mr. Don Welch, Business Development Manager for Oceaneering, telephone (301) 249-3053.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The hour and date for receipt of offers has not been extended. UPDATE, 26 JAN 05:  In response to RFP Technical Clarifications  requests submitted by prospective offerors in accordance with RFP  Section L015, Government responses are hereby posted to the PIXS.   Some of these answers will result in administrative changes to the  RFP and will be posted via RFP Amendment 0001 within the next week.

UPDATE, 4 NOV 04:  The files posted 3 Nov 04 for Attachment 2 (MESL) and  Attachment 3 (MESM)were incorrect as the titles had been erroneously  switched for the files.  These files have been deleted and the correct files have been reposted with a 4 Nov 04 date. UPDATE, 3 NOV 04:  The T-6 COMBS Services acquisition webpage has been updated to include a Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP).  Please review the document in its entirety and submit comments and/or questions to the Contract Specialist cited therein no later than close of business 19 Nov  2004.  Comments may be submitted electronically.  If mailed, they must be  postmarked by close of business 19 Nov 2004. Please note that there has been one slight update to the Government  requirement.  In addition to the previously identified locations requiring COMBS Services support, the Government has updated the DRFP to now also include T-6 Modification Line or any other depot level repair location as part of the requirement.  The T-6 Modification Line is currently located at the Raytheon Aircraft Facility in Wichita, KS.  The requirement involves providing safety of flight parts support for aircraft on the mod line that have component failure unrelated to work performed at that location. UPDATE, 1 OCT 04:  Previously, it was adviced that ORCA would become  mandatory on 1 Oct 04.  However, the FAR final rule has not been published and no release date has been given.  If ORCA becomes effective after the RFP is on the street, the solicitation would be amended to add the ORCA requirement. UPDATE, 30 SEP 04:  Three attachments have been posted below.  These are: The Government briefing from the Industry Meetings held 23 Aug - 15 Sep 04, questions and answers (with Government comments)resulting from the meetings, and an updated acquistion schedule (Attachment 2). UPDATE, 1 SEP 04:  In the near future there will be a change to the FAR to  implement the On-Line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).  The "Open FAR Cases" report shows that the FAR final rule is being reviewed  byOMB, and after that review is complete the final rule will be issued. ORCA will become mandatory on 1 OCT 2004. ORCA will be a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the  collection of FAR level certs and reps on-line.  Potential offerors/ bidders will need to complete certs and reps online at least annually.   Contractors who already are registered in the Central Contractor  Registration (CCR) can get a head start by going to http://www.bpn.gov/orca  to activate their ORCA profiles. Any information specific to the JPATS COMBS Services RFP above and beyond  what ORCA entails will be included in the RFP. NOTE:  A NEW ATTACHMENT HAS BEEN ADDED AT THE END OF THIS  SYNOPSIS.  THIS IS AN INVITATION FOR INDUSTRY TO MEET WITH THE GOVERNMENT. The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) Aircraft Program, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is conducting an additional market survey for the follow-on Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) of the T-6A Texan II aircraft.  We anticipate at most a  10-year (9 month basic and 9 annual ordering periods) Firm-Fixed Price/Time and Materials, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity IDIQ) contract with contract award in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 no later than 30 Sep 2005.    NOTE:  THIS MARKET SURVEY SUPERCEDES PIXS SYNOPSIS 03R0009W (SOLICITATION #F33657-03-R-0009), WHICH WAS  PUBLISHED ON 28 Mar 03.  OUR ORIGINAL REQUIREMENT HAS  CHANGES; WE WILL BE ACQUIRING CONTRACTOR OPERATED MANAGED  BASE SUPPLY (COMBS) ONLY.  AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE SERVICE  WILL NO LONGER BE INCLUDED ON THIS ACTION.   T-6A Background The T-6A is a derivative of the Swiss Pilatus PC-9 MK II, which  uses Non-Developmental Items (NDI) or derivatives of  commercially available items to meet most system requirements.   The   T-6A was missionized by Raytheon Aircraft Company  (RAC), Wichita, Kansas to replace the United States Air Force  (USAF) T-37B and the United States Navy (USN) T-34C primary  training aircraft.  Raytheon owns the data rights to the T-6A  design and all peculiar support equipment.  The T-6A is a low  wing, high performance, pressurized, turboprop aerobatic trainer.   The T-6A will provide entry-level students with the skills  necessary for contact/familiarization, instruments, formation, and  navigation during both day and night conditions.   T-6A training  will lead to a level of proficiency that permits transition into one  of the USAF or USN advanced pilot training tracks.   Current Environment There are presently 143 T-6As stationed at four main operating  bases (MOB):  Randolph AFB, Texas; Moody AFB, Georgia;  Laughlin AFB, Texas; and Naval Air Station (NAS) Pensacola,  Florida.  At the end of this 10-year CLS follow-on support  contract (through FY 2015), there will be a total of 782 aircraft in  the field stationed at these four MOBs and these additional bases:  Sheppard AFB, Texas; Vance AFB, Oklahoma; and Columbus  AFB, Mississippi; NAS Whiting, Florida; and NAS Corpus  Christi, Texas.   Currently, approximately 18% of the fleet has been delivered and  the production line is scheduled to continue through FY 2015 with  the production of 40-70 aircraft per year.  In addition, the USAF  anticipates approximately 30 Class I Engineering Change  Proposals through FY 2012 that will involve (but are not limited  to) both the airframe structural components (e.g., landing gear)  and avionics subsystems.  Attached is a list of some of the tasks in  the execution or planning stages that will affect the upcoming  CLS requirement. At this time, Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC) provides both  the T-6A production and CLS COMBS functions for this program.   Presently, there are 4,000 line items that need to be managed; this  figure may change as engineering changes are accomplished to the  aircraft.  If the awardee of this contract is other than the  incumbent, the Government would require the establishment of an  Associate Contractor Agreement (ACA) with the aircraft  manufacture/ sustaining engineering contractor (Raytheon Aircraft  Company, Wichita KS) and major subsystem contractors for  avionics, engines, etc.  Approximately 60% of the dollar value of  spare parts is controlled by RAC proprietary drawings and designs  which only specific suppliers are licensed to manufacturer.  In  addition, all aircraft parts are required to be manufactured and  repaired under Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified  processes to maintain airworthiness certification for military use. Follow-On Contract Description The CLS follow-on contract will procure COMBS support in  accordance with FAR 15 for the   T-6A aircraft at 11 Air Force  and Navy sites.  The contractor shall establish, operate and  manage a COMBS at each operating base providing a range and  depth (contractor determined) of spare parts/bench stock including  parts for off-equipment/I-Level backshops, spare engines, engine  Quick Engine Change (QEC) kits, engine modular components,  repair parts, peculiar (special) hand tools, support equipment (SE)  and expendables (including aircraft and SE bench stock) necessary  to support the assigned JPATS aircraft at the specified utilization  rate.  The contractor will ensure that all COMBS components are  FAA certified in accordance with FAA (Federal Aviation  Administration) Part 23.  The contractor shall ensure that all spare  parts are configured, painted and balanced (if required) for  immediate installation on JPATS aircraft in accordance with the  approved government technical data.  The contractor shall ensure  that all items with shelf-life restrictions are maintained within items  allowable limitations and tolerances.  No JPATS aircraft  component repair/maintenance shall be accomplished in the  COMBS.  The contractor shall only store JPATS aircraft parts,  TCTO kits and SE in the COMBS.  The contractor shall maintain  data outlining required protective packaging and transportation  requirements (electrostatic discharge sensitive items, fragile items,  hazardous materials, etc) for contractor furnished spare parts and  SE subject to special packaging requirements. The contractor shall support the bases’ daily flight operations and  any OPLAN, exercise, deployment, static display, fly-by,  incentive flight or open house that involves JPATS aircraft or  COMBS.  The contractor shall have spare parts and expendables  (not maintained in bench stock) available for the operating  command within 30 minutes after receipt of a valid demand on the  COMBS during normal duty hours and 30 minutes after arrival at  the base when on-call.  In addition, the contractor will ensure  housekeeping is performed in the COMBS facility. The COMBS contractor will be expected to maintain a current  COMBS spare inventory.  As     T-6A configuration changes are  accomplished on the production line, the COMBS contractor will  update COMBS inventory as appropriate. The COMBS contractor will be expected to provide all support  equipment required to operate and maintain the T-6A.  A list will  be provided in any request for proposal. The COMBS contractor will be expected to perform or  subcontract off-site Intermediate and Depot level repair of failed  reparable components.  A list of historical failure rates and the  CAGE code of the manufacturer will be provided in any request  for proposal. The COMBS contractor will be expected to provide their own  office equipment, phones, phone service, furniture, material  handling equipment, etc., required to operate the COMBS. The COMBS contractor will be expected to manage hazardous  material IAW current Federal, State and Base regulations.  T6-A  hazardous materials are limited to paints/solvents, oils/greases and  explosive components of the escape system. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL  SUBMISSION.  It is a market research tool to determine the  availability and capability of potential sources.  Firms responding  to this announcement should indicate whether they are a large or  small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned  small business, HUBZone small business and/or service disabled  veteran-owned small business.

<DESC>This modification corrects formatting errors in the presolication notice.The National Council on Disability (NCD) has begun an assertive and systematic review of both public and private policies and initiatives aimed at improving the employment of people with disabilities. A primary building block in the sequential but complementary studies on employment is NCD’s currently underway Social Security/Transitioning to Work Study, examining the evidence-based practices that promote the return to work (and transition to work) of working age beneficiaries of the DI and SSI programs. The next building block will be this employment study, which will include the following major components: a) a thorough, systematic examination or “environmental scan” of the nexus between employment and the following areas:  transportation; housing; reasonable accommodations; education; health care; assistive technology; telecommunications; long-term services and supports, and telecommuting, among other topics; b)  the establishment of a business advisory committee and the conduction of public forums to solicit information and input on employment issues and practices; c) the development of informational issue briefs that examine the status and impact of existing employment strategies at the federal, state and local level, such as customized employment, entrepreneurship, telework, supported employment, microbusiness, e-commerce, and competitive employment; and d) a cohesive final report with information drawn from the environmental scan, business advisory committee, public forums and informational briefs along with recommendations aimed at improving the employment status of people with disabilities. This employment study will be conducted at the same time that NCD undertakes a complementary research initiative on financial incentives available to enhance the ability of people with disabilities to live and work independently and in the community of their choice.  The estimated contract period is 12 months.  NCD will distribute its Employment Study Request for Proposals (RFP) to interested parties on February 4, 2005.  NCD will expect interested parties to submit their responses by March 22, 2005.  Copies of the RFP may be requested by mail or picked up on or after the issue date of February 4, 2005.  All requests must reference the RFP number and title.  For more information, contact Joan Durocher, 1331 F Street, N.W., Suite 850, Washington, D.C. 20004, jdurocher@ncd.gov.

<DESC>The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is seeking proposals from licensed, qualified engineering consultants to provide structural engineering and construction documents for animal waste pole-framed buildings and covered concrete slabs with side walls.

The proposed structures will provide a covered storage for manure during rain season to prevent manure washing off site.  The buildings will consist of wood framing members with posts embedded into the earth.  Floors, if part of that design, will consist of concrete slabs on grade.  The designs are to include structural and civil design (no electrical, plumbing, heating or ventilation).  Although the buildings in valid agricultural use are exempt from building permits, they must be designed to meet Oregon State Building Code requirements.  All work is to be completed during the period between February 1 and October 31, 2005.

This procurement is reserved for small business. Interested vendors should submit two copies of Standard Form 330 (SF-330) on or before 4:00 p.m. local time on February 11, 2005 to:

	USDA – NRCS
	Attn: Christopher E. Martin
	101 SW Main St.
	Suite 1300
	Portland, OR 97204-3221

NRCS will select the vendor most qualified for the projects described in this solicitation. The selected vendor will be required to submit firm fixed-price proposals for (1) design and (2) construction management with respect to each proposed structure. Award will be made to the selected firm upon successful negotiation of price. Payment will be made for the design phase upon completion of design, and payment will be made for construction management upon completion of construction.

<SUBJECT>R -- Request for Information (RFI) Scientist and Engineering Applicant Tracking System
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-6527885
<RESPDATE>021005
<ARCHDATE>03102005
<CONTACT>Susan Heilman, Contract Specialist, Phone 210-652-7885, Fax 210-652-2304, Email susan.heilman@randolph.af.mil
<DESC>The Government has a requirement for the continuation and additional development of an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) for the recruitment and hiring of scientists and engineers (S&E) for the United States Air Force (USAF) civil service.  Current recruitment data records will be available in a format consistent with XML HR standards.  

The following capabilities are required for this effort:  
(1)	Integrate the recruitment data records into existing software and/or infrastructure or create a new system to continue the development and maintenance of the ATS and HRDashboard Business Intelligence system, the Applicant Contact Center, and the Responses Management project managed at Edwards AFB, CA, and the Palace Acquire (PAQ) S&E program managed at Randolph AFB, TX.  The ATS shall provide for up to 25 users with ability to add additional users in groups of 10, up to 100 total users.
(2)	Community and university outreach consulting is required at the following universities to entice students to choose an engineering career as a USAF civil servant:  California State University, Northridge; California State University, Fresno; Embry-Riddle University, Daytona Beach; California Polytechnic University; and University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez.
(3)	Incorporate the Edwards AFB pilot project into the PAQ S&E ATS. 
(4)	Expand the ATS to allow execution of non-PAQ S&E positions.  
(5)	Map the current “As Is” hiring processes for the following bases:  Edwards AFB, CA; Hill AFB, UT; Wright-Patterson AFB, OH; Eglin AFB, FL; Warner-Robins AFB, GA; and Tinker AFB, OK and develop a new “To Be” hiring process that will serve as the standard for S&E hiring.
(6)	Conduct initial interviews with process owners, map the processes using industry standard methodology and tools, and validate and seek approval of first draft maps with process owners.  Collaboration with personnel to ensure support and usability on a national scale is essential.
(7)	Transfer and integrate the recruitment data from the resume database, located at www.afciviliancareers.com to the ATS.
(8)	Facilitate university relationships between the USAF and universities where S&E PAQ’s were previously hired or are being considered;  
(9)	Provide training for new users of ATS or as a result of system modifications.  This may be accomplished onsite or via remote (web) access.  

For the above requirements, industry comments are solicited.  Specifically:

1.  Can you integrate recruitment data records into your current system or will a new system be required?
2.  What is the delivery time after contract award?
3.  Please provide your size standard in your response.
4.  Please provide a Rough Order of Magnitude for the effort.

Clarification to Item 1. above.  The Government currently leases ATS services but does not own ATS software or infrastructure.  The Government owns multiple recruitment data records, such as resumes, forms, etc.  Is it viable to take these records in an XML HR format and incorporate them into another ATS or would integration of the records necesitate the creation of a new system?

This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked ‘proprietary’ shall be handled accordingly.  Responses to this RFI will not be returned.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not to be considered as offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY FOR PLANNING PURPOSES.
	THERE IS NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE AVAILABLE.


Responses to vendor questions:

1.  Do the employees currently have an ID card with a bar code, magnetic strip or a smart card of some type?  As we design our solution we would like to build if possible upon your current technology.  Normally, this approach reduces cost and allows for quicker implementation.
 
Response:  Staff members have ID badges (with the exception of Members of Congress themselves) that are the HID type.  We routinely use prox card readers for access to select spaces, but not for building entry or exit.

2.  The buildings involved include; The Capital Building and the Cannon, Longworth, Rayburn and the Ford Office Buildings.  There are no other buildings involved. 

Response:  Yes, those are the primary buildings of interest.  We may, if appropriate, employ whatever we select at smaller outlying buildings, but that will be a later consideration.

3.  There is currently no method for keeping track of which employees are in the buildings.  This includes; badge swipe terminals, biometric units, web-enabled/browser based portal, internal software for entering in/out of office tracking and telephone based call in/out of office system. 

Response:  Correct neither employees nor visitors.

4.  Can you advise me if all of the employees that will be covered in the Evacuation Plan are issued ID cards?  I of course assume that they do but I need to confirm the fact.  Does each employee have a unique ID# or do they use SSN?  Is there a database in place that contains the employee’s name and ID#?  Is there a database that contains the building number the employee works in plus the building section, floor and room number?

Response:  We have some of the information requested on all employees, and yes they all have ID badges with unique numbers.  We have all of the information for some employees, specifically the office emergency coordinators.  We have some databases in use and others under development.  However, the responses to the RFI may give us new or better directions to go. 

5.  Who will manage the deployed system?

Response:    TBD

6.  Where will the servers for the application be located?

Response:   TBD


7.  Is an existing backup power supply available for use by the monitoring system?    

Response:  Possibly

8.  Does the backup power supply cover the entire region the application is intended to operate over?  

Response:  Not likely

9.  How long is the interval between a loss of power from the usual power source and when power from the backup source is available?

Response:  That would depend on where it is located and if emergency power will even be available. No definitive answer is available at this time.

10.  Is there a requirement that the application operate when the commercial communications infrastructure (i.e., land-line and cellular phones, radios, etc.) is not usable?  

Response:  That would certainly add to the reliability and viability of the system in an emergency situation.

11.  Can data communications between the system sensors and server be handled over existing networks (e.g., the one that supports the ‘panic buttons’)?

Response:  Possibly, it would depend on the system requirements.

12.  What are the characteristics of those networks (e.g., IEEE 802.11b, custom wireless LAN, etc.)?

Response:  There is currently no House-wide wireless capability.

13.  Are there any exclusions of the frequency bands that can be used for data transmission beyond the normal FCC restrictions?

Response:  There is a frequency management group that would have to be consulted once frequencies of interest are known.

14.  Are there existing first responder/law enforcement hardware or software systems that the solution must be compatible with?  Interoperable with?

Response:  Not currently.

15.  What is the acceptable error rate for the system?

Response:  There is no single answer to that. Different technologies have different inherent errors.  Each will be evaluated as submitted.

16.  Will there be a requirement for an on-site display capability for first responders in addition to the display in the EOC?

Response:  There will be a requirement for some degree of display at the Incident Command site, but it may not be the same as is required/desired at the EOC.

17.  What restrictions would apply to the installation of RFID portals in interior passageways of the buildings?  Are there wire trolleys, wiring conduits, or other wiring options available in the buildings?  

Response:  The Capitol building has severe architectural restrictions.  The other buildings have limitations, but they are not as restrictive.  All buildings have some current infrastructure, but there is no guarantee that it will be available or compatible with the proposed system requirements.

18.  Please provide additional information the relative timing of the two phases. Approximately how long after phase 1 would phase 2 be required?

Response:  They are both going on in parallel.  There is no specific timing specified. 

19.  Please provide information on the timing of the implementation. When is it anticipated that the service would need to be installed (assuming the project moves forward to purchase and implementation)?

Response:  As soon as practicable, depending on approval, budgeting, contracting, etc. 

20.  Who are the expected users of the system? Capitol Police, DC police, DC fire department, and others? 

Response:  Yes to all. 

21.  Will any others have or need access to information from the system during an emergency? Who are the "Incident Commanders and Emergency Center Operations staff" and approximately how many people do these groups include? 

Response:  Who and how many doesn’t seem particularly relevant at this stage.  Suffice it to say that, at a minimum USCP HQ, the Incident command posts and an Operations center will all require access to data to some degree. 


22.  Would the system be used only in the event of an emergency evacuation or for other purposes as well?

Response:  This is an emergency system only. 


23.  In the first phase, is the purpose of the "graphical map" to show the current position of the personnel within and around the buildings during an emergency, or to show status of personnel by assigned office? For example, the occupant of this office has responded that he or she is in a safe location.

Response:  The example is correct. 

24.  How much detail is required in the maps? Do you need to know a person is assigned to a room, or only that he or she is assigned a specific location (desk/cubicle) within a room.

Response:  We are only looking at room occupancy, not individual space within a room. 

25.  Does the 3D mapping require a view of all buildings and surrounding area simultaneously or merely one building at a time?

Response:  All affected buildings should be able to be called up, individually.  An overall summary table showing all affected buildings status would also be expected. 

26.  Does this RFI encompass the U.S. Senate as well the House (i.e., the entire capitol building area)? Or will a similar system be required for U.S. Senate offices and buildings?

Response:  We will be sharing information with the Senate, but there is no guarantee that the House and Senate will move down the same path. 

27.  Will a sole source provider strategy be pursued?

Response:  Not necessarily.  Multiple providers and a combination of systems is certainly an option. 

28.  Please define "status" in phase 2: "provide a complete picture of the status of all USHR building occupants"?

Response:  Safe, not reported, reported as unsafe/trapped, etc. 

29.  Do visitors to the USHR at the time of the evac need to be accounted for within the system, or are visitors beyond the scope of this project and system?

Response:  Visitors are currently not tracked at all.  A system for visitors is in the foreseeable future, so please address them if you have options. 

30.  The RFI states that there is no overall maximum volume/size of submittals but there is a 4 page limit on details of systems descriptions.  Would the 4 page limit be for the overall system or for each component of the overall system?  Does this page limit also cover the description of the use of the system in the 2 phase approach to the accountability process? 

Response:  No, the 4 page limit is not intended to cover the entire system proposal.  However, we also don’t want to have to sift through several hundreds of pages per proposal to determine viability.  The more voluminous the overall proposal becomes, the more critical the Executive summary is.

31.  I read recently that the House will most likely switch to Smart ID cards this coming fall.   Did you hear anything about that?  It is not significant from the point of view of our response since we will incorporate whatever type of reader is needed into the proposed system.
Response:  There’s been nothing official at this time.

32.  What I am trying to determine is if there are pre-set evacuation gathering sites for employees. If so how many, where are they located etc?  What policies are current in place for employees to follow in case of an evacuation and what if any is the notification process to be followed by employees to notify their office that they are ok?  What means of communications are in place, i.e. cell phones, Nextel, pagers etc?  
Response:  We do not want to necessarily influence input by what we do today. However, there are some things that will probably not change.  For normal evacuations we will continue to rely on the Office Emergency Coordinator (OEC) performing an accounting for his/her staff and then the OEC reports that accountability to a U.S. Capitol Police officer at a designated assembly area.  There are two or three designated assembly areas per building, in close proximity to the buildings, where this reporting to the USCP is performed.  Offices are responsible for there own internal communications devices and they include blackberries and cell phones, but only for select staff.  
 
Beyond that, petty much everything is flexible and open for revision.
 
33.  May we hand in supporting materials (pictures, specs) in the form of power-point slides?  

Response:  That would be fine.

34.  Are you having any industry sessions where we might be able to learn a little more about the current systems in place?  
Response:  I encourage you to submit your ideas (which will be held in confidence by the House for our assessment purposes); based on what we receive, we may follow-up with vendor(s) to gather more information.  What we currently have is not relevant to what you can offer or where we may end up.

<DESC>The Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) is seeking sources in California for engineering services.  The Future Air Navigation System (FANS)/Communications Navigation and Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) has been implemented by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) for operations in international air spaces.  The FANS functionality allows a greater number of aircraft in a smaller portion of space.  Current and future military aircraft are undergoing upgrades to their navigation systems to comply with this capability.  The FAA has also embraced this standard and is currently implementing its use in the United States.  The implementation of FANS continues to grow globally.  The Air Traffic Control Communications Test Facility and Avionics System Test (ACTFAST) system, a unique DoD asset, requires the capability to support testing and certification of military aircraft to both the FAA and ICAO mandated standards.  To keep up with the expanding role of FANS equipment, the following upgrades to the current capability at the AFFTC are required:  South Pacific Regional Ground Station; SATCOM Stand Alone Control Agent (SACA); Additional Data Link Service Provider; Additional Avionics and control room equipment; and additional simulation capability.
The South Pacific Regional Ground Station will allow for ACTFAST to test military aircraft with the actual ground station being used in FANS air space. This capability will enhance the testing of military aircraft for these new functions while the equipment is being developed resulting in additional cost savings to the platforms under test.
The SACA will provide a portable CNS/ATM test capability that could substantially decrease the amount of SATCOM time needed to fully test CNS/ATM information attack on the aircraft resulting in a large cost savings to the platform.  
An additional Data Link Service Provider allows interoperability certification with both of the top two service providers worldwide.  
Additional avionics and control room equipment would increase the test support workload capacity to support the projected increase in demand.
The additional simulation capability would increase the fidelity and capability of our current systems and allow for multiple simulation configurations tables test capability and support bug fixes and changes to the ATC workstation.

<DESC>15- Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) for the P-e Fleet or a replacement program for that fleet.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) operates 8 P-3B airborne early warning (AEW) aircraft and 8 P-3A/B long-range tracker aircraft to protect the American people and critical infrastructure by detecting, interdicting, and deterring terror and criminal acts as they relate to the unlawful movement of people, money, and goods across U.S. borders, or within restricted domestic airspace.  The P-3B AEW utilizes a 360-degree radar in a rotating disk, mounted on the top of the fuselage similar to the U.S. Air Force AWACS aircraft, to detect, track and monitor multiple air and marine targets.  A P-3A long-range tracker aircraft equipped with intercept radar often flies in conjunction with a P-3B AEW to intercept, identify and track those targets.  P-3 aircraft are primarily used to detect and track suspect targets in the source and transit zones, however, the importance of P-3 AEW aircraft for the protection of critical infrastructure within the U.S. has grown as DoD commitments in other regions have increased.

As the P-3 fleet has aged, numerous problems such as corrosion and cracks in the wing spar caps have increased unscheduled maintenance costs and reduced operational availability.  New maintenance practices have been incorporated to reduce those costs and safely improve availability but a more extensive modernization program is needed to provide a long-term solution.  Therefore, CBP wishes to explore the feasibility and practicality of various modernization options including implementation of a service life extension program (SLEP) for the P-3 fleet or a replacement program for that fleet.

<DESC>The Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) is seeking sources in California for the following engineering services:  Background: Link-16 (TADIL-J) is the Tactical Data Link (TADIL) of choice for U.S. forces and is becoming the predominant data link for NATO forces as well.  Link 16 is currently mandated by the Air Force to be integrated into the avionics of all USAF aircraft by 2010.  Link-16 affects the aircraft avionics including weapons systems, situational awareness, targeting, and mission assignments/objectives.  Use of Link-16 is increasing with the impetus towards greater and greater information transfer for improved situational awareness, targeting, surveillance, and reconnaissance required by today’s warfighter.  The Link 16 Range Infrastructure Support Project provides a capability to test the integration of the DoD’s primary joint tactical data link (Link-16) in a manner that reduces schedule and cost risk to multiple Air Force programs.  This saves the Air Force money by having center assets capable of this testing and avoiding the need for each platform to purchase its own equipment and duplicating assets.  It also enhances the ability to develop avionics systems that better meet the warfighters’ needs by having a complete set of test tools versus duplicated subsets of tools owned by each platform.  The Air Force Flight Test Center requires additional Link-16 test support assets to meet the projected demand for Link 16 testing. 

Sources are being sought for the following:  Portable Stand Alone Link 16 Ground Test Stations; Virtual Link 16 Connectivity Test Sets; and Link 16 Monitoring, Data Reduction, and Analysis tools.  The Portable Link 16 Ground stations would allow complete stand alone test sets that allow the Range Division test support assets to communicate via Link 16 to Systems Under Test (SUTs).  The Virtual Link 16 Test Sets will take advantage of infrastructure that already exists in both Link 16 assets and the fiber communications to facilities where assets are located.  This will allow virtual Link 16 testing to take place in a Network Centric manner.  The Link 16 Monitoring, Data Reduction, and Analysis tools will provide the ability to complete real time Link 16 data monitoring and post flight data reduction and analysis and will also provide the AFFTC the ability to ensure compliance with FAA restrictions and replaces the limited capability data reduction and analysis tools currently used for Link 16 testing.  

This synopsis is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bid or proposals.  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this synopsis.  Responses shall be limited to 15 pages and should include, as a minimum, (1) evidence of past experience; (2) related projects and/or existing systems, etc.; and (3) business size.

<DESC>Secretary of Interior National Park Service Grand Canyon National Park REQUEST FOR INFORMATION RFI Noo26050002.  Please Note:  This is a reannouncement of our original Request for Information (RFI) to garner further responses from additional sources.  The original RFI (N0026050001) was posted on Fed Bis Ops in December with a response date of 01/14/05.  Please note the "Limitations" paragraph, which has been added to this announcement, below. This Request for Information (RFI) is NOT a Solicitation for Offers (SFO), and is NOT a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  Response to the RFI will NOT serve as a proposal, bid, or offer, which could be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.   The National Park Service (NPS) is currently examining partnering alternatives for housing under the authorities granted in its Administrative Reform Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-333, U.S.C. § 17o, dated November 12, 1996).  The NPS is interested in gaining further information through market research from providers with relevant and sustained experience in the housing industry.  The objective of this RFI is to obtain technical capability profiles tailored to the requirements outlined below as well as answers to a series of questions regarding the provider capability to furnish the services as described. Grand Canyon National Park (GRCA) has a requirement for high-quality energy star compliant housing located on GRCA.  The provider will secure debt and/or contributed equity as needed to accomplish the following: (1) design, finance, and construct 60 units, and (2) operate, manage, and maintain the units, including certain streets and selected infrastructure, and ancillary facilities.   Includes performance of all maintenance and capital renewal to ensure the units remain in high-quality condition during lease period regardless of location.     The housing requirements are:   # of Units	# of Bedrooms	Square Footage (Approximately) 32	1	500 28	2	1,060 The GRCA potential housing site is both level and vacant and on-park.  The site is located approximately a quarter mile west of the intersection of Albright Road and Center Road in South Rim Village.  The hatched area on the attached map indicates the disturbed area at the former Yak Camp where the potential site is located.   There are trees and buildings throughout the potential site.   Potential bidders will be responsible for the demolition of existing buildings on the new construction site, however there are no restrictions on the removal of the vegetation in the area.   The NPS currently expects the site size to be approximately 7 acres.  The park location requires the partner to install, connect and maintain all the utilities and streets to the Albright Road intersection.  Also, the developer must install landscaping consistent with the local environment.   GRCA would rent the site to the provider, for twenty five to fifty years (depending upon financing and options), for a nominal fee.  The park location will be used for NPS housing needs, and all housing must meet NPS quality standards and blend in with the park environment.     The total rental charges for NPS personnel are prescribed by OMB Circular A-45 and adjusted annually.  While rental rates typically increase, they may also decrease.  The monthly rental rates for FY05 are: (1) 1 bedroom unit - $230 and (2) 2 bedroom unit - $456.  Utility costs are borne by the occupant and paid separately.  LIMITATIONS- The Secretary of the Interior may not guarantee-- (i) the occupancy of more than 75 percent of the units constructed or rehabilitated under such lease; and (ii) at a rental rate that exceeds the rate based on the reasonable value of the housing in accordance with requirements applicable under section 5911 of title 5, United States Code. The NPS anticipates a base lease period of 25-30 years, followed by a series of options ranging from 5 to10 years.  The total duration of the project will not exceed 50 years.  Any property built on GRCA will revert to the government at end of lease period.  Off-park property shall remain within the possession or control of the provider. Technical Capability Profiles: 1.	Company qualifications (years in business, independent financial statements, number of rental units managed, geographical location(s) of business operations) 2.	Experience in developing and managing housing, particularly under similar programs (federal/state/local). Questions:  1.	What could you do to help NPS reduce both construction and operations/management costs? 2.	What is your estimate, if any of a required NPS financial contribution (upfront and/or recurring) to the project beyond rent revenue stream?  Park?  Off-park? 3.	What approach would you employ to meet all maintenance and capital renewal needs?  Specify, how funds would be set aside to cover these expenses. 4.	What approach would you employ to ensure that on-site development conforms to the park environment and needs? 5.	How do you envision the long-term business relationship between the NPS and your company would work? 6.	What are the pros and cons for locating the development in park?  Off-park? 7.	What other steps could the NPS take to improve the long-term success of this project? Questions or inquiries from potential bidders can be addressed Bruce Blackistone, Program Manager, NPS Space Management Program at 202-354-1939 or via email at bruce_blackistone@nps.gov.  Site specific questions regarding the location of the proposed site and conditions in the park may be directed to Nicky Lindig, Chief, Administration at GRCA at 928-638-7711 or via email at nicky_lindig@nps.gov.

Installation Description

Pine Bluff Arsenal (PBA), located in Southeast Arkansas, is 35 miles southeast of Little Rock and eight miles northwest of the city of Pine Bluff.  It is bordered on the east by the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System and on the west by the Union Pacific Railroad and U.S. Highway 65, making it directly accessible by rail, road or waterway.  The city of Pine Bluff boasts one of the busiest ports on the Arkansas River and serves as a transportation hub for the regional railroads.  PBA is located in Jefferson County, 35 miles south of the Little Rock National Airport and 40 miles from Little Rock Air Force Base.  The 15,000-acre (approximate) installation is under the command jurisdiction of the Commanding General, U.S. Army Soldier and Biological Chemical Command (SBCCOM).

Construction of Pine Bluff Arsenal (PBA) began during the World War II era. Since then, it has been an active military facility. Today, as a part of the U.S. Army Materiel Command, it has housing areas, headquarters and administrative areas, numerous production facilities, testing facilities, ammunition storage and loading areas.
Pine Bluff’s mission is to provide support to the Department of Defense in the production and storage, and demilitarization of chemical munitions.  The PBA vision is to become a world-class facility for the production of smoke/pyrotechnic munitions and chemical/biological defense items; and the developmental support center for emerging technology in these areas.
The Arsenal’s population is composed of approximately 1,000 military and civilian employees. The civilian work force is an ever-changing number, dependant upon the production schedule assigned to PBA. Civilian employees comprise approximately 90 percent of the total PBA population.
The following system descriptions provide potential offerors with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the utility systems. 
Electrical Distribution System Description

The PBA electrical distribution system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the distribution system between the points of demarcation separating Government ownership of the distribution system from the electric supplier and separating the distribution system from end-users. The system may include, but is not limited to, circuit breakers, transformers, circuits, protective devices, utility poles, duct banks, switches, street lighting fixtures, and other ancillary fixed equipment. 
The electrical distribution system at PBA includes:
•	approximately 102 miles of overhead primary circuits;
•	approximately 11 miles of underground primary circuits;
•	three distribution substations providing approx. 22.5 MVA;
•	approximately 14 miles of lighting circuits; and
•	approximately 26.4 MVA of transformer capacity.
Pine Bluff Arsenal currently purchases its electric power requirements from Entergy Arkansas, Inc. (Entergy), which feeds the PBA electrical distribution system at three locations. It provides two 115 kV feeders into the Main Substation (also referred to as Substation C) and one 13.2 kV feeder each to Substations A and B.
The majority of electrical distribution circuits at PBA are constructed on single wood pole structures with 8-foot cross arms and pin type insulators. 
Feeder sectionalizing switches are installed at selected locations in the distribution system to facilitate operational flexibility and maintenance safety. Capacitor banks and small line regulators are installed at several locations for voltage stabilization and power factor improvements.
Natural Gas Distribution System Description

The PBA natural gas distribution system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the distribution system between the points of demarcation separating government ownership of the distribution system from the natural gas supplier and separating the distribution system from end-users. The system may include, but is not limited to, regulating stations, pipelines, valves, regulators, and meters. 
PBA purchases its natural gas service through the Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) from Oklahoma Gas and Electric (OG&E) Energy Resources Company. The OG&E natural gas is delivered via a Reliant Energy natural gas pipeline to the Arkansas-Louisiana Gas Company (ARKLA) city gate and is then delivered to the PBA natural gas distribution system. 
ARKLA supplies gas from a transmission system, which receives its gas from fields in east Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Oklahoma. An emergency connection to the Mississippi River Fuel Company’s transmission line is also maintained by ARKLA adjacent to the east boundary of PBA.
The PBA natural gas distribution system is made up of pipeline ranging from less than 1- to 10-inches in diameter, consisting of several material types (i.e., steel, coated and wrapped steel, cast iron, black iron, polyethylene plastic, and coated and wrapped black iron). Despite the vast material types, the majority of the 3-inch and larger pipes appear to be made up of coated and wrapped steel.  Total length of the gas distribution network is approximately 150,000 LF.
Potable Water Distribution System Description

The PBA potable water system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to pumping stations and distribution components. The system may include, but is not limited to pumps, pipelines, valves, fire hydrants, storage facilities/tanks (including obstruction lights), and backflow prevention devices (BPD)s. 
All water rights (pumping or purchased) will remain with the Government; no water will be transported off the installation.
Specifically excluded from the water distribution system privatization package:
•	Irrigation systems
•	Fire suppression systems
Until approximately 1989, there were two distinct water systems operated and maintained by PBA. A south system that provided potable water to the entire Installation was separate and distinct from a non-potable system that existed on the Installation’s north side. The non-potable system that provided fire protection to the Depot Area (Area 5) is now non-operational. The well that provided raw water to the now inoperable system is retained for future demilitarization use. A modernization project in the late 1980s improved the Area 5 distribution system to support the growing requirements on the Installation’s north side. This system is henceforth referred to as the North System.
The principle potable water source for PBA, as well as much of southeastern Arkansas, is the Sparta Sand Aquifer. Several wells supply the water used at PBA. These wells are typically 700 to 1,100 feet deep with pumps set at approximately 340 feet. The aquifer serving the wells is currently adequate; however, the aquifer level is receding and mandates that water pumped from PBA wells not be sold to customers off the installation.  
The Water Treatment Plant TP has a rated capacity of 2 million gallons per day (MGD); however, the effective capacity is reported at approximately 1.44 MGD. 
Storage capacity totals approximately 1.2 million gallons in six elevated storage tanks. 
The water distribution network system is made up of pipe ranging from less than 2 to 16 inches in diameter, consisting of several material types; most common types are cast iron and PVC.  Total length of the water distribution network is approximately 350,000 LF.
Wastewater System Description

The PBA wastewater system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the collection system as defined by the points of demarcation beginning at the connection to the treatment provider and ending at each end use facility. The system may include, but is not limited to, gravity pipelines, force mains, manholes, lift stations, valves, controls, and wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs).  
Originally constructed in 1942, the PBA wastewater collection system is divided into two separate systems. Each system possesses its own wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The two systems are known locally as the Incendiary Bomb Filling System (south) and the Chemical Area System (north). A separate collection and treatment system exists in the manufacturing area for industrial waste. The industrial waste system is not included in this privatization effort. Several septic tanks are located in remote areas of the Installation and are used to treat domestic waste. These septic systems are also not included in this privatization effort.
A force main that discharges effluent from both WWTPs to the Arkansas River outfall was installed in 1994 and is permitted by the Arkansas Department of Pollution Control and Ecology (ADPC&E). 
Total length of the collection network is approximately 200,000 LF.
Southern Area
Within the south system, the wastewater is collected through a series of 4 to 24-inch gravity main lines.  There are 10 pumping stations within the south system. Two pumping stations pump wastewater directly into the WWTP while the remaining eight stations discharge wastewater to the gravity sewer system. The original sewer lines (installed in 1942) primarily utilize vitrified clay for the gravity mains and cast iron for the force mains. The depth of the sewer lines in the south system ranges from 5 to 12 feet. The total treatment capacity of the south system is 1.7 MGD. The average daily wastewater flow is approximately 0.3 MGD.
The south collection system utilizes 10 lift stations throughout the collection and treatment systems. 
Northern Area
The north collection system is similar to the south system in that it utilizes 4 to 24-inch gravity main lines. There are seven pumping stations moving the wastewater to the north system WWTP. The gravity mains in the north collection system are primarily vitrified clay while the force mains are primarily cast iron pipe with an average line depth of 7 to 7½ feet.  The total treatment capacity of the north system is 0.9 MGD.
The north collection system utilizes seven lift stations to move the wastewater to the north WWTP.

<SUBJECT>Achieving Interoperability with Digital Signature Standards
<DESC>January 19, 2005 REQUEST FOR INFORMATION Sponsoring Organization:	Office of the Department of the Navy Chief Information Officer On behalf of:	Department of Defense Digital Signature Interoperability Team Subject:  ACHIEVING INTEROPERABILITY WITH DIGITAL SIGNATURES Introduction: This is a request for industry comments synopsis and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a request for proposal, award a contract or otherwise pay for information provided in response to this synopsis.  This synopsis is for information gathering only and does not restrict the Government as to the ultimate technical policy is may choose to implement or, if applicable the acquisition procedure it may choose to pursue. General Background: Over the last 3-4 years, the Department of Defense has aggressively deployed an identity management system that combines the use of hardware token (e.g. the Common Access Card (CAC)) and public key technologies (e.g. DoD Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)).  These components are envisioned to be used to provide non-repudiation and secure authentication to unclassified network and web-based services.  The Department has issued over 5 million CACs, installed hundreds of thousands of smart card readers/middleware, and enabled thousands of web sites to utilize public key technology for authentication.  However, the linchpin to these initiatives is the ability of the Department’s business owners to re-engineer their business processes to become more efficient and paperless by using CAC, PKI, and digital signatures. Problem Statement: To fully leverage the use of digital signatures across the Department of Defense, it is necessary that digitally signed transactions can be shared with different areas of the Department that very likely will have different desktop configurations.  It has become apparent that current implementations do not provide this flexibility.  Vendor implementations of industry leading digital signature standards (Public Key Cryptography Standard (PKCS) #7 and Extensible Markup Language Digital Signature (XML Dsig)) appear to be not interoperable within each standard. To alleviate this concern, a small team of subject matter experts within the DoD has developed implementation guidance (i.e. profiles) of these standards.  This RFI is centered around the attached Draft DoD Profiles for PKCS #7 and XML Dsig.  It is our intent to require all applicable desktop applications (e.g. mostly web-browsing and document processing applications) to implement PKCS #7 and XML Dsig in accordance with these profiles for all future and potentially current product releases.  It will be used to digitally sign documents, electronic forms, and web objects. Specific Questions: Please review the attached draft Profiles and provide any recommendations as desired.  Additionally, if each respondent can address the following specific questions, it would be greatly appreciated. 1.	In your opinion, would these profiles cultivate interoperability as outlined in the problem statement?  Do you have any suggestions on how to improve these profiles? 2.	In your opinion, are there any viable alternatives to providing implementation guidance (i.e. profiles)? 3.	What are your current and future planned implementations?  Do they address the concerns expressed in the problem statement? Would they meet the requirements outlined in the implementation profiles? Submissions: General comments and questions regarding this RFI shall be directed to Mr. Bill Huber, Contracting Officer, at William.huber@navy.mil or (717) 605-3210.  Specific technical comments and questions should be directed to Mr. Jonathan Baldwin, DoN CIO, at jonathan.Baldwin@navy.mil. Please provide all responses via e-mail to jonathan.baldwin@navy.mil. by COB 03 February 2005

<SUBJECT>J -- OUTBOARD ENGINE AGE EXPLORATION
<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE. This Request for Information is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the U.S. Coast Guard, Engineering Logistics Center (ELC). The purpose of this Request is to obtain written submissions to identify potential sources that are interested in and capable of performing the work described herein. ELC welcomes written submissions from all private sector concerns that have the capacity to perform.
SUBMISSION CONTENT AND FORMAT: (10 page limit) GENERAL: Respondents must list a principal point of contact, with phone number and email address, as well as any website associated with your organization.  SPECIFIC: Qualified respondents are required to furnish written submissions of no more than 10 pages that describe your organization's overall understanding of the notional requirements statement as well as your capabilities and qualifications necessary to support our requirement. In addition, your response should include your proposed technical and management approach as well as cost estimate to support a one year age exploration effort.  All proprietary information should be marked as such in your submission. Submissions will be reviewed by United States Coast Guard personnel and will be held and protected in a confidential manner.  SUBMISSION PROCEDURES:  Electronic copies of the proposals are preferred and may be submitted via e-mail.  Following is the street address for hard-copy submissions:  Carol Dreszer, USCG Engineering Logistics Ctr., MS 25, 2401 Hawkins Point Rd., Baltimore, MD 21226. DUE DATE:  28 FEBRUARY 2005, 2 PM EST. Questions pertaining to this effort or electronic copies of submissions may be submitted to the contracting officer via e-mail to: cdreszer@elcbalt.uscg.mil .  E-mailed questions shall have "AGE EXPLORATION" in the subject line.  NOTIONAL REQUIREMENTS STATEMENT:  The Coast Guard is seeking companies who are capable of performing "age exploration" on select U.S. Coast Guard equipment.  The term age exploration has its origins with Reliability-Centered Maintenance.  "Age Exploration" is a process used to collect specific data to replace estimated or assumed values that were used during initial maintenance development.  Age exploration tasks are used to collect specific data from actual operational and test environments to replace the assumptions that were made during the initial maintenance analysis and PM task development efforts.  AE data may reveal the need to extend, shorten or, in some cases, establish or eliminate PM tasks. Other references for application of age exploration can be found in (Nolan and Heap, NAVAIR). ISSUE: The U.S. Coast Guard utilizes 225 horsepower, six-cylinder outboard engines with a total engine population including spares exceeding two thousand four-hundred for a recently procured class of boats.  Significant resources will be expended in maintaining these engines.  For this reason, the preventive maintenance system to support these engines must be optimized.  As a means to improve and optimize the maintenance, an "age exploration" program in the context of Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) needs to be accomplished.
DISCUSSION:  Since historical maintenance data for this outboard engine is not available, OEM (original equipment manufacturer) recommended maintenance has been the only avenue to select initial tasks and intervals.  Age exploration will be used to determine the applicable and effective maintenance tasks and intervals in order to reduce the cost of unnecessary and/or ineffective maintenance.  Submissions must describe the age exploration process and how the application of RCM will be factored into the process.  A listing of current generic maintenance requirements for the outboard engines is as follows:  
PMS Task Description -Periodicity:
Replace gear case oil -	100 hours of operation; Inspect and adjust throttle linkage	- 100 hours of operation; Inspect and adjust Idling speed - 100 hours of operation; Inspect and service Water separator - 100 hours of operation; Replace low pressure fuel pump filter - 100 hours of operation; Replace outboard engine oil and filter -	100 hours of operation; Lubricate outboard engines - 100 hours of operation; Inspect timing belt -200 hours of operation; Check crankcase breather tubes - 200 hours of operation; Replace fuel strainer on the high pressure side - 400 hours of operation; Inspect and replace outboard engine spark plug - 200 hours of operation; Inspect thermostat -200 hours of operation; Inspect fuel lines - 200 hours of operation; Inspect Alternator belt - 200 hours of operation;
Inspect and adjust valve clearance - 200 hours of operation.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  NO COST OR PRICING DATA IS REQUIRED.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.

The Contractor must have access to all necessary maintenance, rework and overhaul manuals and performance/test/acceptance criteria and data to ensure that equipment is reworked/modified, calibrated, and operating in accordance with the current specifications.  Where an application of “best commercial practice” principles are in conflict with DMWR, the Contracting Officer may, upon request from the Contractor, approve deviation from DMWR requirements. DEFINITIONS.   REWORK:  To refurbish components and restore clearance and performance specifications in accordance with the U.S. Army’s Depot Maintenance Work Requirements Manual, publication number DMWR-55-2840-248-1 and –2 (up to and including change 14 dated July 31, 1997), hereafter referred to as the DMWR. UNUSUAL DAMAGE:  Items which have been severely damaged due to mishandling, mechanical failure or crash damage, or in which repairable assemblies have been cannibalized.  Items, which are missing consumable components, that require replacement during, overhaul and rework, are not considered to be unusually damaged. CANNIBALIZED:  Components listed in for which integral parts are missing when the component is provided to the contractor for repair.  MODIFICATION:  To make basic or fundamental changes on items specified in the schedule of components when required by the Contracting Officer.  The vendor shall also include the part number affixed to the modification.  The contractor must be able to perform upgrades/modifications at the same time as the OEM, if contractor is other than the OEM.  AOG:  An  “Aircraft on the Ground” condition, indicating that an otherwise operational aircraft is temporarily grounded awaiting rework and return of the part or component.  This condition requires the component be handled as a high priority, and that its return be expedited. QUALIFICATION OF PIECE PARTS:  The aircraft engine, and its components, is considered “flight safety critical aircraft parts”.  The use of piece parts or components other than OEM or DOD approved parts is prohibited without prior express written approval of the Contracting Officer.
SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS.  Equipment shall be reworked/modified as 
necessary to meet current minimum functional performance and test specifications designated in the DMWR.  In accordance with this contract the contractor shall be required to perform the following: RECEIPT OF ITEMS:  Upon receipt of repairable items, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing of the date of receipt, and shall confirm the serial number(s) of item(s) received.

NOTE:  Coast Guard aircraft operate primarily in a saltwater environment and are subject to corrosion.  Contractors are advised to expect corrosion on equipment to be reworked under this contract.  During inspection and functional testing, the presence of corrosion in an assembly or component or part thereof shall constitute reason for a more thorough disassembly and inspection.  Should corrosion be found, disassembly shall be made only to the extent necessary to remove corrosion or replace the part(s) affected.  Corroded parts shall be replaced except in those cases where removal of corrosion from part will not impair efficiency of safe operation of the part.  CHANGES TO SPECIFICATIONS/DRAWINGS AND OBSOLETE PARTS/PROCESSES:  The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing when changes are made to the DMWR specifications or drawings applicable to components listed in the schedule.  Such notification shall include the nature of the changes and details sufficient for the Coast Guard to evaluate the scope and impact of the change.

     The following provisions and clauses are incorporated by reference: FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (Jan 2004) with the following included by Addendum: 52.211-14 Notice of Priority Rating for National Defense Use (Sept 1990) DO rated;  
FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS  (JAN 1999)
(a) The Government will award a contract(s) resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors, in descending order of importance, will be used to evaluate offers:
      (i) Past Performance (based on reference checks and/or historical performance records); 
      (ii) Price and price-related factors. 
	Offered Price will be adjusted for evaluation purposes based on shipping cost and custom duties.  The following information is required for the evaluation.
Shipping Cost, provide an estimated cost of each line item. Shipping Cost is not required if the offer is FOB destination shipping.  Provide shipping point. 
Custom duty, the United States Coast Guard does not have duty free entry, as some other United States agencies. Therefore items repaired from a foreign manufacture may be charged duty in accordance with customs regulations. Provide an estimated cost of duty for each line item based on current available information. Further, provide a line item total price for all custom duties.  Custom Duty included as part of the price, should indicate it as such.  Port of entry is Norfolk, Virginia. Also, explain how the price was developed for shipping and custom duties in the proposal, e.g. actual cost, historical data, or by other means.  Offers that are significantly higher or lower than the government estimate may be considered an indication that the offeror does not understand the requirement and may be evaluated as posing a significant performance risk.
Performance risk will be integral to the evaluation of all proposals.  Past performance, is significantly more important than price.

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. However this requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quote. ***

***The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for twenty (20) each, Beryllium Oxide Neutron Filters for MACS Detector System to be used in the NIST Center for Neutron Research at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD.  ***
 
***All interested offerors shall provide a quote for the following line item:  Line Item 0001: The Contractor shall furnish twenty (20) Beryllium Oxide Neutron Filters for MACS Detector System.***

Background

The Department of Commerce and the National Institute of Standards and Technology have developed a major national facility for neutron scattering.  This project provides for over fifteen unique instrument stations for use by national and international researchers for materials research.  In addition, instruments are also provided for fundamental physics research, neutron interferometry, and neutron optics.

This procurement is for pure polycrystalline beryllium oxide blocks that will be used to reject unwanted high energy neutrons from the detection system.  Due to the crystalline structure of the material and the coherent nature of interactions between neutrons and beryllium oxide, neutrons with wave lengths greater than 0.47 nm pass through this material with a low probability for scattering and absorption.  However, shorter wavelength neutrons are strongly scattered so that an incident parallel beam of neutrons with wave lengths shorter than 0.47 nm is converted into an approximately isotropic point source emanating from the filter.

2.0 Scope

The procurement covers a total of twenty beryllium oxide blocks with identical dimensions, purity, and physical characteristics specified to achieve the desired performance as neutron filters.  The blocks are shaped as truncated right rectangular pyramids.  There is a special requirement of uniformity of the chemical composition and grain distribution so that the twenty detection channels where the filters will be used have similar sensitivities.

3.0 Contractor Requirements

The contractor shall ship twenty accurately dimensioned beryllium oxide blocks of specified chemical purity to the NCNR. A certified analysis verifying compliance with all specifications shall be included. In addition there are requirements to provide materials samples that the NCNR will test for compliance with specifications as detailed below.

3.1 Bulk Materials Specification

Chemical composition weight percent: These specifications are set to ensure sufficient content of the desired beryllium oxide majority phase.

- Beryllium oxide greater than 99.5 percent
- Composition variation between items of the order less than 0.5 percent RMS

Density: This specification ensures that the materials density is high enough to perform the required filtering function. The room temperature density shall be within 1 percent of the theoretical Be0 density of 3.009 gm/cm3.

Grain distribution: This specification is set to maximize Bragg dieaction of neutrons with wave lengths shorter than the 0.47 nrn filter cut-off.

- Average grain size between 5 mm and 20 mm
- Grain orientation distribution anisotropy over 1 mm 3 less than 5 percent
- Average grain size variation over items in order less than 0.5 percent RMS

The maximum content of any other impurity element shall be greater than 0.2 percent by weight Impurity content variation between items in order shall be greater than 20 percent RMS.

Physical Characteristics: The following specifications ensure that the beryllium oxide blocks can be mounted as mechanical bodies without shedding toxic parts.

- No cracks are permissible.
- Largest dimension of any mark on the surface less than 1.5 mm
- Number of surface marks with size between 0.015 mm and 1.5 mm less than 4 per 25 an2

3.2 Physical Dimensions

The material shall be delivered as accurately dimensioned blocks. A total of twenty blocks with identical dimensions, are covered by the order. The physical dimensions, tolerances and surface finish are specified on the attached drawings.

3.3 Markings

The large font surface of the filters shall be marked with the following: "Beryllium F Oxide", vendor name, lot identification, item identification and purchase order number. Any marking technique that does not add additional material can be used.

3.4 Certified Materials Analysis

All materials delivered under this order shall be accompanied by a certified chemical analysis indicating the Be0 weight percent, the impurity content, and compliance with the grain size distribution requirements.

3.5 Samples

All materials samples provided by the contractor under this order shall have a mass of at least 1 gm and shall form a single contiguous body with 1 mm being the smallest linear dimension and with no dimension larger than 20 mrn. The shape is otherwise unimportant.

3.5.1 Pre-performance Samples

Upon issuance of a contract, the contractor shall deliver a sample that is representative of the materials to be delivered so that the NCNR can verify compliance with the chemical purity and grain size specifications.  

3.5.2 Delivery Samples

Each beryllium oxide block shall be accompanied with a materials sample and a certification that the sample is representative of that block. The samples may be subject to any form of analysis chosen by the NCNR to verify compliance with specifications.

4.0 Government Responsibilities 

The government will perform at least two types of analysis on the pre-performance sample and report the results to the contractor. Neutron activation analysis will be used to determine the impurity content and neutron diffraction will be used to determine the grain size and orientation distribution. Similar analysis may be performed on the acceptance samples and if these samples are found not to satisfy the requirements, then the results will be reported to the contractor.

5.0 Acceptance

A certification of compliance with all material specifications from the contractor shall be a condition for acceptance. In addition, the NCNR may inspect all materials received in any way they see fit to ascertain compliance with the material and dimensional specifications. Items that fail to meet these acceptance criteria shall be repaired or replaced by the contractor at no additional expense to the government.

***Delivery shall be FOB DESTINATION and be completed in accordance with the Contractor’s commercial schedule. ***

***The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.  The contractor shall deliver all line items to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-0001. ***

<CONTACT>Holly  Carr, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-329-7250, Fax 301-203-5362, Email holly.carr@gsa.gov
<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested, and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The General Services Office of Chief Information Officer (CIO),  located at 1800 F Street NW Washington DC 20405, a requirement for
Lotus Service Manager (LSM) (or equivalent) up to twelve (12) visits; Support via Techncially Senior Analysts for up to 10 callers; Remote Diagnostic Assistance; 8 field support service days; 1 emergency onsite assistance engagement; quarterly developer teleconference calls; 5 knowledgebase subscriptions; access to draft technotes; includes travel and expenses for LSM, FSS, and EOS. 
The following questions and answers shall be incorporated into the statement of work:

1.	Is this requirement for one full time Lotus Service Manager for 12 Months? 

	The Government is looking for the LOTUS Partnership Level Support Program (PSP) equivalent. The Government requires support for 12 months.  The Lotus Service Manager ("LSM") works with the Customer's management and technical staff within a single region to provide coordination and management for the customer's technical support relationship with IBM in relation to the Software.
	
	The Customer's technical support incidents will be received by the Designated IBM Customer Support Center.  Technical Support Analysts within the Designated IBM Customer Support Center undertake the appropriate technical investigation in order to process the customer's technical support incidents.  The LSM will monitor the customer's support incidents to ensure effective engagement of Customer Support Center processes.  The LSM will help manage the Customer's priority incidents to help ensure that the incidents are progressed in an efficient and timely manner.  The LSM will enlist the appropriate IBM resources and drive the appropriate IBM escalation processes in order to manage the Customer's priority incidents.

2.	“12 visits” + 8 support service days + 1 Emergency onsite assistance engagement = 21 days.  Does this mean that resource only needs to be available for “quarterly developer teleconference calls? 

	The LSM (or equivalent) will develop an understanding of the Customer's support needs and deployment plans through discussions with the Customer's support personnel and in meeting with the Customer.  The LSM will proactively provide the Customer with technical information specific to the Customer's environment and conduct conference calls as needed to discuss deployment strategies, new products as well as to review open technical support issues.  The LSM will facilitate knowledge transfer in Lotus technologies and invite the Customer to participate in technical briefings.

3.	Support via Technically Senior Analysts for up to 10 callers?  Is that 10 callers at once or supporting 10 users?  Would the senior  analysts be the same person as the manager or different?  Are the technically senior analysts billed in the project or are they separate?

	The Customer will receive 24 hours, 7 days a week (365 days per year) priority telephone access via a managed queue for up to TEN (10) Named Callers to the Designated IBM Customer Support Center.  Customer's support incidents will be directed to technically senior support analyst during regular Hours of Operation of the Designated IBM Customer Support Center.  

4.	Remote Diagnostic Assistance?  As in "install and configure a remote diagnostic assistance software infrastructure" or "can answer tough questions over the phone?"

	Remote Diagnostic Assistance:  Where the necessary tools and technologies are available, the Designated IBM Support Center may if  appropriate, and with Customer's agreement, remotely access the Customer's system to assist Customer in isolating the problem cause.  Remote Diagnostic Assistance may not be available for all products and all platforms.  The goal of Remote Diagnostic Assistance is to gather  additional information needed to aid in troubleshooting an Incident that has been reported to the Designated IBM Support Center.  Remote Diagnostic Assistance does not extend to administering or making changes to the Customer's system.

5.	Knowledge Base subscriptions?  Please define.  

	Lotus KnowledgeBase means the Lotus Notes-based reference database made available by IBM to Cusomer as part of the Support Services that contain up-to-date technical information for identified Lotus products and may be used by Customer solely for internal support purposes.  	Customer will be entitled to FIVE (5) Lotus KnowledgeBase subscriptions, entitling the Customer to receive Lotus KnowledgeBase via a 	
	CD-ROM.
	
6.	Access to draft technotes - This would come with your server licenses or a business partner account, do you already have this or are expecting the Vendor to provide this as well?

	Customer will be entitled to access draft documentation within the Lotus KnowledgeBase. Such draft documentation is provided to Customer  soley on an AS IS basis without warranty of any kind, including any implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, and 
IBM reserves the right to modify or delete such draft documentation, in whole or in part, at any time without notice. Please see above.

7.	Travel expenses for Lotus Service Manager – To where and how often

	The LSM (or equivalent) will make up to TWELVE (12) visits to Customer's primary site each year, not to exceed twelve (12) days in total.  LSM site visits are included in the charges.  The Customer may be subject to a separate charge for travel and expenses for any additional visits mutually agreed between the Customer and the LSM.  In the event additional travel is requried, it shall be travel shall be conducted in accordance with Federal Travel Reuglation and to be approved in advance by the Contracting Officer.

8.	The Government’s estimated level of effort for this requirement is $148,000.00.

Questions and Answers:  48FW.Com Updated 28 January 2005

Q:  Do you know of similar type projects of this length of time and what the costs were? 
A:  We are the only Base in USAFE doing this but Langley and Hawaii 

Q:  Is there currently a SharePoint Portal solution in place? 
A:  Yes the severs have all been built and the site is up and running.  
 If so, what is the current Intranet / Extranet architecture  Currently we are running Sharepoint 2003 in a medium Sever farm architecture. But looking to grow to a large server farm with LCS
 Can you or the customer provide me diagrams of the current solution?   Cannot disclose network architecture.. Just that we have built off of the Microsoft whitepapers Med server farm with a Microsoft consultant.

Q:  Have hardware and software licenses been purchased? 
A:  Yes most of them except 2 SQL licenses which will be purchased by March 

Q:  What is the purpose of the portal; what are they currently using the Intranet/Extranet for; what is it they hope to be able to do with SharePoint Portal 2003 and LCS?
A:  We are currently using it to provide all normal base information on a intranet/extranet plus the capability of accessing our ESN drives (team sites) and we are using our mysites as collaboration areas.. LCS will be used on base only not through the extranet 

Q:  SharePoint can be extended extensively, how much integration do they want to do with other applications (other than LCS)?  
A:  Right now we are just looking to integrate LCS, K2 and Merido are not on our scope at all 
The hired contractor/s  will be working with our 3 person team. The portal has been developed and we are looking now more to sustainment and upgrading capabilities within SharePoint. LCS integration is still/was suppose to be advertised as a future capability and only if it is approved at MAJCOM.

Q:  What about Back up and anti-virus solutions, and I would like to know what vendor/software packages are being used as well as versions and support. 
A:  We're working on a backup solution with the NOSC at USAFE.  The contractor will need to be familiar with our solution, but will not need to manage it or be responsible for it. We use Comvault.

Q:  The ammended SOW asks for 25 hours/week.  Is that a total of 50 hours for two people or just 25 hours for one? 
A:  We need someone on site for 25 hours a week.  They can send 2 people here if they need to, but we only need those 25 hours covered. 

Q:  Can you please clarify what parts may need to be purchased as described in Para 2.1.2.
A:  2.1.2.  Equipment. The Government will provide the contractor property that is needed to satisfy the requirements of this contract except for any parts that are required to be purchased. Government will provide maximum 2 work stations and telephone for local and base calls as well as LAN access.

Q:  Is there any logistical support for this requirement
A:  No, logistical support is not authorized for this specific requirement.
