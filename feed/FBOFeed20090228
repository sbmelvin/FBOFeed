<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Office of Subsistence Management (OSM) requires court reporting/transcription services for several meetings that will occur according to a set schedule in various locations throughout the state of Alaska.  The Contractor shall provide all management, supervision, labor, travel and supplies necessary to provide court reporter services as specified for the Office of Subsistence Management (OSM).
This solicitation is a total small business set-aside under NAISC Code: 561492 with a size standard of 500 employees.
Background:In 1980, Congress passed the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA).  Title VIII of ANILCA provides for the continuation of subsistence uses of fish and wildlife resources on Federal public lands by rural residents in Alaska.  Specifically, Title VIII of the law mandates that rural residents be given a priority for subsistence uses and required the creation of the Regional Advisory Councils to enable rural residents to have a meaningful role in Federal subsistence management.  In 1972, Congress passed the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) to ensure that standard procedures govern the establishment, administration and duration of committees set up to advise the Federal government.  Federal advisory committees must be chartered and meetings must be open to the public.  FACA also requires that Congress and the public be kept informed about committee activities.  The Regional Advisory Councils are Federal advisory committees and, therefore, must comply with the Act's requirements.  Therefore, Regional Advisory Council meetings are public meetings.  Transcripts of these meetings comprise a critical component of the administrative record for the Office of Subsistence Management (OSM).  
The Contractor shall be responsible for providing accurate transcripts of all Regional Council meetings for the fisheries and wildlife regulatory cycles and one annual Federal Subsistence Board meeting (January) that fall within the periods of performance.
PersonnelThe Contractor shall utilize skilled and productive labor in order to satisfactorily furnish the required level of services.  Failure on the part of the Contractor to utilize skilled and productive labor may result in the Government terminating the contract for default.A.	Qualifications of Employees:  All personnel engaged in the work to be accomplished under this contract shall be fully trained in the operation of the sound system and transcribing equipment necessary to produce accurate and timely transcripts of the meetings.  All personnel engaged in the work to be accomplished under this contract shall be fully trained in the appropriate protocol and activities supporting the meetings.B.	Alien Labor:  It is illegal to bring into the United States, to transport or harbor aliens who do not have proper visa for entry and working in this Country (U.S.C. 1323-1325).  If the Government suspects violations during performance of work on this contract, it will be reported to the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service for investigation and appropriate action.C.	Written Notification of Personnel:  The Contractor shall provide in writing to the Contracting Office within five (5) days prior to the contract starting date the names, work classification, telephone number and addresses of contractor personnel who will be performing work under this contract.  This list of personnel will be updated by the Contractor prior to a change in personnel at the work site.  D.

<p>All waste quantities regardless of their condition, are being discarded by the U.S. Government and are considered to be waste and not available for resale or reuse with the exception of approved recycling procedures. All quantities listed in the bid schedule(s) are estimated (actual quantities are not known until orders are placed). The U.S. Government may unilaterally withdraw any item(s) on the delivery order for use, reuse, or recycling, at any time.</p>
<p>Performance capability is required for handling Spontaneously Combustible Materials; and Dangerous When Wet Materials/Water-Reactive Substances; Class 6 Toxic (Poison/Poisonous) Substances, Class 8 Corrosive Substances, and Class 9 Miscellaneous Hazardous Materials/Products; Substances.

<p>While other contracts exist, at this time, for sales and recycling of lead acid batteries, the U.S. Government may or may not choose to add those items at a later date. When added to the BPA the price for those items will be negotiated and inserted into the BPA prior to placement of any delivery orders.</p>
<p>At this time very limited in-country recycling (only used lead acid batteries recycling) and no disposal facilities are operational and approved by the U.S. Government. In the event that U.S. Government approved facilities are operational in the future and are capable of handling waste, the U.S. Government may request new pricing for the affected CLINs or may withdraw the CLINs from the BPA.</p>
<p>Offerors are directed to first consider submitting offers that implement approved recycling processes whether in country or out of country. Estimated quantities for most waste and token disposal quantities on some wastes are identified in the Schedule. In all cases recycling is the first choice of the U.S. Government (See C-26). Where approved recycling is not possible the offerors are instructed to provide the unit price for compliant disposal.</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF SERVICES:</p>
<p>a. The intent of this contract is to provide in-country (Iraq) recycling and/or disposal, if permissible, for hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Those waste streams that cannot be recycled or disposed of in-country shall be transported to a country with recycling and/or disposal facilities capable of meeting U.S., Canada and/or equivalent western European treatment or disposal standards.</p>
<p>b. Industrial, hazardous waste incinerators and/or Battery mobile processing plants/facilities are highly desirable for in-country disposal. Companies with mobile processing plants/facilities conforming to local and/or international structural safety and air emissions standards will be given competitive selection preference.</p>
<p>c. The primary non-personal services to be rendered by the contractor consist of, but are not limited to, inspecting wastes and their containers, packaging/repackaging, labeling, marking, loading/unloading, sampling and analysis, removal, transportation, interim storage (if necessary and permissible), recycling/disposal of hazardous wastes and other wastes listed in the schedule in accordance with all terms and conditions of this contract.

<p>e. All disposal and recycling facilities, local, national, and international must meet the specifications as outlined in this BPA, and must be approved by the Contracting Officer as described in other clauses in this BPA.</p>
<p>f. Waste disposed of under this BPA may possibly be contaminated with one or more substances not specifically identified in the CLIN.

<DESC>Multiple Award, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) 
Task Order Contracts in support of Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) 
Programs throughout the State of Arkansas

Up to six (6) IDIQ contracts will be awarded in support of Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) programs throughout the State of Arkansas.  Individual projects located within the Arkansas state boundaries will be competed as competitive negotiations among the awarded contractors.  The contracts will primarily be used for the Wetland Reserve Program (WRP) projects.  These projects generally include hydrology and vegetative restoration.  Examples of projects include construction of earthen dikes or levees, water control structures, rock riprap water control structures, earthwork activities to construct micro-topographical features, tree planting site preparation and tree planting, seed bed preparation and planting of native grasses.

CONTRACT INFORMATION:  This procurement is set-aside for up to three (3) awards to a HUB-Zone small business firm(s); up to one (1) award to a service disabled veteran owned small business firm; and up to two (2) awards on an unrestricted basis.  The contracts will be awarded for a one year period.  The not-to-exceed contract value for each contract is $750,000.  The guaranteed minimum amount for the program is $5,000.  If no task order awards are made to any of the awarded contractors, the guaranteed minimum will be divided equally among the awarded contractors.  Individual projects located within the Arkansas state boundaries will be competed as competitive negotiations among the awarded contractors.  In selecting a contractor for task orders, evaluation factors are significantly less important than cost or price.  Evaluation factors for selecting a contractor for task orders are listed in descending order of importance:  (1) performance on task orders awarded under this program, and (2) contractor capacity.  The awarded contractor(s) shall not be required to submit an offer or perform work on any single task order less than $5,000 or greater than $500,000.  Orders greater than $30,000, but not greater than $100,000 shall require a payment bond.  Orders greater than $100,000 shall require bid bond with the offer, and a performance and a payment bond if awarded the task order.  

CONTRACTOR SELECTION CRITERIA:  Contractor selection will be based on the following factors, listed in descending order of importance:  (1) Past Performance (projects of similar size and scope), (2) Experience (projects of similar size and scope), (3) Capacity to Complete Work (availability of equipment and qualified manpower, including subcontractors), (4) Environmental Protection Plan, (5) Quality Control Plan, and (6) Safety Plan.  All evaluation factors for contract award selection other than cost or price are approximately equal to cost or price.  Offerors will be required to provide pricing for a sample project that will be included in the solicitation package.  The sample project may or may not be awarded as a task order.  The Government reserves the right to make contract award(s) without negotiation, based on initial offers.

CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS:  Successful offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), http://www.ccr.gov, and must have completed the Online Representations and Certifications (ORCA) to receive a contract award.  Failure to register in these systems will result in the offer not being considered for award.  The solicitation will be posted to FedBizOpps on or about March 16, 2009, with offers received on April 15, 2009, or as stated in the solicitation.  A pre-proposal meeting to discuss the solicitation is scheduled for March 24, 2009, at 10:00 a.m., or as stated in the solicitation.  Minutes of the meeting will be provided to all offerors.
