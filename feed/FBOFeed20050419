<DESC>SYNOPSIS The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Global Positioning System (GPS) Program Office (ATO-W) has a requirement for Flight Management System (FMS) software enhancements and system integration for the FAA Challenger 604 aircraft and a modification package.  The Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) for this FMS is provided by the Multi-Mode Receiver (MMR) to support flight inspection of WAAS procedures in the National Airspace System (NAS).  Rockwell Collins (RCI), Cedar Rapids, IA, is the manufacturer and has proprietary rights to the FMS, MMR, and other avionics software and hardware installed on the FAA's Challenger flight inspection aircraft.  In addition, Rockwell-Collins is the only source that has the trained personnel and the essential proprietary software code to integrate the curved path LPV system with the RCI FMS installed in the CL-604 aircraft.  The FMS software was developed by RCI at its own expense and no other source has the rights to the FMS software code.  Due to the proprietary nature of the software modification being made to Rockwell Collins independently developed system hardware, the FAA does not have the rights in data to provide any other vendor a data package that would or could be used for a competitive acquisition as such, no additional effort has been made to solicit offers.   Rockwell Collins has extensive knowledge and expertise with respect to the WAAS Minimum Operational Performance Standards (MOPS) and equipment certification suitable for installation in CFR Title 14 Part 25 aircraft.  The intent of the WAAS program office is to certify WAAS Lateral Positioning with Vertical (LPV) approaches to encourage WAAS adoption by regional airlines.  The Collins Equipment that this software operates on provides the Unique flight inspection functionality must be implemented in the FAA Challenger 604 to comply with operational requirements.  The WAAS FMS LPV functionality will provide Flight Inspection Aircraft (FIA) with a WAAS flight inspection capability and a potential truth source.  It will also provide the FAA flight inspection aircraft with WAAS horizontal and vertical positioning.  WAAS LPV supports future growth toward curved path LPV. All comments must be returned to FAA, Bid and Proposal Officer, Room 316, Multi-Purpose Building, 6500 South MacArthur Boulevard, Oklahoma City, 73169, IF MAILED--use FAA, Bid and Proposal Officer, Room 316, Multi-Purpose Building, P.O.

<DESC>The 45th Contracting Squadron intends to negotiate a contract on a sole source basis with Dynamics Technology, Inc., for Multi-Phenomenology Source Term and Propagation Modeling.  The primary objective of this effort is to develop an integrated modeling suite for prediction and characterizing multi-phenomenology signals emanating from equipment and facilities.  The modeling suite will consist of imported facility models, source term models, and multi-phenomenology propagation models.  The architecture will allow for the easy integration of future source term and propagation models.  The sole source acquisition is justified under 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Evaluation of the contractor’s unique capability and existing products, concluded that the highly specialized effort required is available from only one source.  A cost-plus-fixed-fee contract is contemplated with one-year basic contract period and a 1-year option period.  This effort would require both a facilities and storage capability of at least the SECRET NO FOREIGN level, and the ability to support secure communication capabilities at the SECRET NO FOREIGN level.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and size standard are 541330/$23.0 million.  No solicitation documents exist at this time.

If the Government has not completed review of the SAR when the contract is awarded, the SAR will be retained and the source will be reviewed for possible Source Approval for future awards. Government Furnished drawings will not be provided with the solicitation. To obtain technical data, potential offerors must use TEDS at https:www.fedteds.gov/.  A formal solicitation will be issued, and if a potential source wishes to have a formal solicitation, one will be supplied.  The award is expected to be made to approved sources on record as of this posting. Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).
NOTE:  An ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The purpose of the ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the Program Manager or Contracting Officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 736-3273.  DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.

<DESC>Issue date: 27 APR 2005. Miltope TP2000 Printer. This is a microcomputer controlled, high speed, thermal printer that uses 4 1/2 inch wide paper rolls. Sole source: Cage: 54418, Miltope Corporation, 3800 Richardson Road South, Hope Hull, AL 36043-4022
Sole source provide justification: Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(C)(1), Justification: Supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the proposal.  However, the Government will consider all proposals received prior to the closing date on the solicitation.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Specifications, plans, or drawings relating to the procurement described are incomplete or not available and cannot be furnished by the Government.  The Government does not own the data or the rights to the data needed to purchase this item from additional sources.  Sole Source: Miltope Corporation, 3800 Richardson Road South, Hope Hull, AL 36043-4022.  Miltope is the Original Equipment Manufacturer.  The current printer being used requires a unique type of paper which is almost out of stock and is no longer manufactured.  This has made it necessary to pruchase these newer printers that are compatible with the Re-entry System Test Set (RSTS) for the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Weapon System.  Any change in printer design would necessitate an extensive engineering effort to fit a new model of printer into the A15 rack and to interface a new printer with the RSTS computer.  There are no identified alternatives to this Miltope printer model. Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation.

<DESC>The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) Detachment 12, Space Test Program (STP) Office, Kirtland AFB, Albuquerque, NM, is contemplating the award of an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for one or more small space vehicles to fly future space experiments. The scope of the IDIQ contract will be an initial order of one (1), and a maximum order of six (6), space vehicles over the life of the contract. Other space hardware such as separation devices, adapters, and miscellaneous launch/space support hardware, will be included in the scope of the contract. This will be a 6-year contract with an initial order for one spacecraft, integration & testing of one or more experiments onto the spacecraft, launch site preparation of the space vehicle, anomaly resolution and data trending for at least one year of  on-orbit operations. The space vehicle will be designed to fly a range of low earth orbits within a range of inclinations with a minimum one-year lifetime as described in the Technical Requirements Document. Other delivery orders are anticipated (up to a maximum of 5 additional) but are not part of the initial order. The purpose/goal of this program will be to design, fabricate, integrate, and test a spacecraft with a standard interface to the experiments so that future spacecraft would require minimum redesign. This acquisition will be procured using Full and Open procedures. STP has begun an incremental release of a Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP), SOO and all subsequent documents on the STP-SIV (ESPA Class) Website, http://www.smc.kirtland.af.mil/stp-siv.html. Interested Offerors are asked to submit a written letter of intent (or email) no later than (see Block 4) to Mr.Chris Milburn, 3548 Aberdeen Ave SE, Kirtland AFB NM 87117-5776.  Industry comments to the DRFP and SOO are encouraged and should be submitted no later than 26 April 05.  The Government reserves the right to award without discussions. If discussions are to be conducted, a competitive range may be established which will be comprised of all the most highly rated proposals unless further reduced for purposes of efficiency.  For this proposed acquisition, and using the small business size standard for North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 336414, the size standard of 1,000 employees apply. Potential Offerors are advised that work to be performed will require up to a Top Secret/SCI facility clearance and safeguarding capability.  Adequate key personnel shall be cleared to perform at the Secret level at time of award.  There shall be a capability in place not later than 18 months after contract award for TS/SCI facilities and TS/SCI cleared personnel. Space Vehicle requirements will be provided on the website and in the RFP technical requirements document (TRD). Potential offerors will be required to develop a realistic standard spacecraft to payload (experiments) interface as part of their proposal. In addition, requirements for the first experiment will be provided, upon request, to U.S. Government Prime Contractors.

<DESC>COMPUTER PROGRAMMING SERVICES, CUSTOM / WEB PAGE DESIGN SERVICES CUSTOM
The FISC Norfolk, Philadelphia Division intends to acquire through competitive, small business set-aside procurement, development and implementation of an Internet Web-based, Department of Navy Criminal Justice Information System (DONCJIS) on behalf of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), representing the interests of the U.S. Navy (USN) and U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) Law Enforcement, Corrections, Judge Advocate General (JAG) judicial components, and the Defense Incident Based Reporting System (DIBRS) Component Responsible Officials (CRO).  This is a requirement for a contractor to provide full life cycle software development services (requirements analysis, project management and planning, design, development, testing, documentation and training, implementation, and post-implementation support) for a new Criminal Incident and Case Management System.  The Department of the Navy Criminal Justice Information System (DONCJIS) is an evolutionary next step in the modernization of the Consolidated Law Enforcement Operations Center (CLEOC) and will serve as the Navy’s cradle-to-grave law enforcement information system by incorporating data on criminal investigations and their associated legal proceedings and correctional records.

The primary objective for DONCJIS is to provide a web-based interface for data entry of criminal incident and case data; incorporate business processes and workflow requirements from the law enforcement, investigative, judicial, and corrections user community; enhance the existing systems for US Navy and Marine Corps Law Enforcement, JAG, and Corrections users; provide full data processing and case tracking capabilities from incident to corrections; include in-depth reporting capabilities, data extracts, and statistical analysis of criminal data; and solve limited network bandwidth problems for users who connect to the system via dial-up connections.

The contractor will be evaluated at Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) Level 2 or higher and will have to design the system to be interoperable with the Navy-Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) environment and to conform to other existing Navy software and system architecture to be identified in the RFP.  The contractor will need a familiarity with criminal justice systems, especially those of the Navy and Marine Corps, in addition to the web and computer technical expertise.  This requirement will also include 24/7 Help Desk Support for DONCJIS.

The contractor shall perform development work in close association with cognizant NCIS personnel at either the Washington Navy Yard or local contractor facilities; after the development of the prototype, training will be held at NCIS CONUS and OCONUS sites.

Contractor personnel are required to have a minimum-security clearance of DoD “SECRET” and are subject to an NCIS background investigation to determine suitability for access to criminal investigative data pursuant to Department of Justice regulations.  

This requirement will be evaluated on a best value basis and offerors will be expected to submit both cost / price and technical proposals for the consideration of the Government.  This requirement has been set aside for small businesses.  All qualified small businesses are encouraged to submit proposals for consideration of the Government.  A cost plus fixed fee contract is anticipated to result from the solicitation with some fixed price items in the out-years.  It is anticipated that an initial proof of concept installation will be required with up to five option years in which full implementation of the DONCJIS will be accomplished if all options are exercised.  All contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration system.
THE RFP N00140-05-R-1517 WILL BE POSTED ON THE NECO WEBSITE AT WWW.NECO.NAVY.MIL NO EARLIER THAN 4 MAY 2005.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of 41 U.S.C.253(c) with Menlo Systems GmbH, Martinsried, Germany for a tunable laser.  

The NIST Ion Storage Group is conducting research toward the development of the next generation time and frequency standards. For the past five years, NIST has concentrated its research efforts toward determining the feasibility of frequency and time standards that are based on narrow optical transitions in single, laser-cooled ions. A primary goal of the research is the development, operation and evaluation of an optical clock. Since a frequency standard must run continuously in order to function as a clock, all components of the system, including the lasers for cooling, state preparation, and state detection, must also run continuously. Critical specifications are as follows: These lasers must either be solid-state devices or derived from solid-state devices. The Optical clock shall be based on a single laser-cooled mercury ion, which requires stable radiation at two colors near 194 nm that are separated by 47 GHz. NIST intends to generate these two deep-UV colors by sum-frequency-mixing radiation at 717 nm with two sources near 266 nm that are separated by the same 47 GHz. In order to maintain the 47 GHz frequency difference, one of the radiation sources at 266 nm will be frequency offset-locked to the other. The stronger radiation source does the primary cooling of the Hg+ ion. The second source is much weaker and does the repumping, state preparation and helps in the state detection. Absent any laser at 266 nm, NIST can generate light at this color by frequency-doubling the radiation from lasers at 532 nm. Both the primary and secondary sources of radiation near 532 nm must be narrowband and tunable. The power output of the second source shall exceed 100 mW. Very importantly, this second source shall have a high-bandwidth transducer whose response will permit us to phase-lock it to the primary source. The minimum bandwidth shall be greater than 10 kHz and the transducer shall be externally accessible. The only known source, MenloSystems, offers the combination of high power (greater than 100 mW), fast response (greater than 10 kHz with an amplitude swing of 100 MHz), and external accessibility to the frequency transducer. 
This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13.1, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (under $100K). This notice is for information purposes only. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government’s best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement.  Terms and conditions can be found at http://www.arnet.gov/far and agency level protest procedures can be found on web site http://oamweb.osec.doc.gov/CONOPS/reflib/alp1296.htm. Anticipated award date is May 6, 2005.

STATEMENT OF WORK
C.3 - Scope of Work


The contractor shall supply the personnel, materials, and facilities necessary to provide services ordered by the NRC under individual task order assignments.  Work to be performed shall be described in task orders which shall specify the scope of work, deliverables, period of performance, and performance requirements and standards.

The contractor shall be responsible for providing technical assistance to NRC staff for the development and documentation of rules, evaluation of petitions for rulemaking, backfit analyses, and regulatory guides, and assistance in the preparation of supporting analyses.  The following are typical types of tasks that may be assigned which may require contractor support to NRC staff under this contract:

--	Providing input to the NRC staff for technical support documents for rulemakings, development of responses to petitions for rulemaking, and regulatory guides;

--	Supporting the staff's analyses of public comments on proposed rules, advance notices of proposed rulemaking, and petitions for rulemaking;

--	Providing input to NRC staff on preliminary rulemaking planning documents whose objective is to reach early consensus on regulatory products;

--	Reviewing current technical literature on specific issues preparatory to providing recommendations to the NRC staff for support of rulemaking activities;

--	Reviewing provided information on risk to assist the NRC staff in determining the risk-informed nature of a rulemaking;

--	Assisting the NRC staff in reviewing draft contractor research and technical assistance reports for accuracy and relevance, and recommending appropriate staff utilization of research results in the rulemaking development process; 
								
--	Providing input to NRC staff on environmental assessments or environmental impact statements by developing analyses as specified in the task order;
								
--	Developing regulatory analyses for NRC staff, which could include information needed for backfit analyses, information collection burden submissions, and regulatory flexibility analyses; and

--	Developing generic databases and methodological tools for NRC staff which can be used in the analyses required for specific rulemakings.

C.3.1	Support for Rulemaking Planning

The initial step in the NRC rulemaking process is preparation of a rulemaking plan.  The contractor may be tasked to provide information which the NRC staff can use in preparing the rulemaking plan.  The contractor may be tasked to develop the following information:
	            
- An assessment of whether the rule is likely to be cost-effective;

- An evaluation of whether the rule is risk-informed;
		
- An assessment of whether the rule would meet backfit analysis criteria and safety goal criteria, where these are applicable;

- An assessment of potential implementation problems, such as with Agreement State implementation; and

- A preliminary assessment of likely impacts on licensees.

C.3.2	Summary and Analysis of Public Comments

During the rulemaking process, the NRC solicits public comments on proposed rules, and when applicable, advance notices of proposed rulemaking, and notices of receipt of petitions for rulemaking.  NRC also solicits public comments on draft Regulatory Guides, draft Regulatory Analyses, Environmental Assessments, Environmental Impact Statements, and on occasion certain other documents, such as policy statements.

If requested, public comments must be summarized and analyzed for use in the regulatory process.  A summary of public comments must be completed, usually within 30 days of the close of the public comment period.  This summary is a relatively brief document which allows the NRC staff to have a concise picture of issues raised by commenters.  The analysis of public comments must be done in accordance with guidance in the most recent version of NUREG/BR-0053, NRC Regulations Handbook.  Each issue raised by commenters must be analyzed for impact on the development of the regulation.  As required, the contractor will assist the NRC in comment resolution.  This may include assistance in:

- Identifying any substantive changes made as a result of public comments and the reasons for accepting the suggestions;

- Identifying any new material or information relevant to the rulemaking received as a result of public comment; and

- Assisting NRC staff in discussing any substantive comments that were not accepted and the reasons for rejecting them.

As appropriate, the contractor shall summarize information from databases on public comments.

C.3.3	Development of Regulatory Analysis/Value-Impact Analysis

The regulatory analysis/value-impact portion of the rulemaking or other regulatory package provides the technical support for NRC's decision concerning resolution of a regulatory issue.  As a result, these tasks require strong analytical, technical, and engineering capabilities in the quantification of costs and benefits.  The rules and other regulatory actions to be supported under this contract often concern proposed requirements in which modifications to facilities are present.  Consequently, strong expertise in engineering disciplines, and an ability to translate performance specifications into technical design specifications are of major importance.  However, many rules and other regulatory issues involve administrative and procedural changes.  Support for these latter activities may involve primarily non-engineering disciplines.  Regulatory analyses must be developed in accordance with the guidance in the most recent versions of NUREG/BR-0058, Regulatory Analysis Guidelines of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and NUREG/BR-0184, Regulatory Analysis Technical Evaluation Handbook.  Specific guidelines and relevant documentation will be provided to the contractor by the NRC upon issuance of a task order.

a.	Development of Cost Analyses
	
Rulemakings and other regulatory actions are subject to cost analyses.  Those cost analyses  shall encompass all impacts of a regulatory change, covering individual as well as classes of licensees or other regulated activities.  The contractor shall assist the staff by providing input into cost analyses and providing cost estimates on the type, extent, and duration of the impacts of: 

	i)	Capital or implementation costs to applicants and licensees; 

	ii)	Operational or reoccurring costs to applicants and licensees;

	iii)	Costs to government entities; and

	iv)	Costs to state and local agencies.

Costs shall be expressed in monetary terms, using present value with a real discount rate provided by NRC, and using constant dollars.  Estimates shall be subjected to sensitivity analysis to capture the uncertainties inherent in the quantification of attributes.  Annual costs shall be established per current or future regulated activity, and then determined for the remaining lifetimes for all affected activities.  The costs to be estimated shall be limited to those that would be incurred by the regulatory change.  The contractor shall document the sources of cost data and the methods used for deriving cost estimates.

b.	Estimation of Benefits
	
Health and safety benefits arise due to reductions either in the probability of accidents or consequences of accidents attributable to the proposed requirement.  Depending on the nature of the regulatory action, other benefits may include, for example, regulatory efficiency, improvements in knowledge, savings on paperwork and operating requirements, and improvements in facility availability.  Analyses shall cover all benefits of a regulatory change. After the type, extent, and duration of the benefits have been determined by the contractor, estimates of benefits shall be made, when applicable, of:

	i)	Public dose reduction expressed in person-rem averted and dollars;

	ii)	Averted property damage (onsite and offsite);

	iii)	Occupational exposure reduction; and

	iv)	Other benefits (e.g., regulatory efficiency, improvements in knowledge, etc.).

Benefits shall be expressed on a present worth basis with a real discount rate provided by the NRC, and using constant dollars.  Estimates of benefits may require sensitivity analysis of real discount rates.  Annual benefits shall be established per current or future regulated activity, and then determined for the remaining lifetimes for all affected activities.  The benefit to be estimated shall be limited to those that would be incurred by the regulatory change.  The contractor shall document the sources of data and the methods used for deriving benefit estimates.

The costs and benefits to be considered in a given value-impact analysis cannot be determined until a specific task has been identified. 

By the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (the Act), NRC must consider the economic effect of its regulations on small entities.  The Act requires that NRC prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis for a rulemaking, or certify that a rule will have no significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.  The regulatory flexibility analysis may be combined with the regulatory analysis of which specific guidance is in the regulatory analysis guidelines.

C.3.4.	Environmental Analyses

For many of its rulemakings, NRC must prepare environmental analyses; draft and final environmental assessments and/or environmental impact statements.  The contractor may be tasked to develop supporting information for these analyses.  Environmental analyses shall be prepared according to the guidance in NEPA as implemented in the agency's regulations at 
10 CFR Part 51.  Much of the information developed for the regulatory analysis may also be used in an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement.  Individual task orders will specify the type of assistance the contractor shall provide in conforming to the guidance in NUREG-1748.


C.3.5	Paperwork Reduction Act Information

NRC rulemakings which require changes in information collection burdens on the public must be accompanied by a submission to OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.  This submission must contain :

- a description of the information collection;

- justification for the information collection;

- a description of agency use of the information;

- how the agency will use information technology to reduce the information collection burden;

- the agency's efforts to identify duplication;

- the agency's efforts to use similar information;

- efforts to reduce the burden on small businesses;

- consequences of less frequent collection of the information;

- quantitative estimates of the cost to the public of the information collection; and

- quantitative estimates of the cost to NRC of the information collection.

Much of this information is typically developed as part of the regulatory analysis.  The contractor shall provide information sufficient for NRC to prepare all needed documentation.

C.3.6  Backfit Analyses

Backfit analyses are required for some NMSS licensees whenever a new or amended rule would mandate modification or addition to systems, structures, components; or design of a facility; or the design approval or manufacturing license for a facility; or the procedures or organization required to design, construct, or operate a facility.  The backfit analysis may be developed as part of the regulatory analysis, depending on specific task order statements of work.

The analysis shall address:

	(1)	The objectives of the backfit;

	(2)	The activities required for the backfit;

	(3)	Risk to the public from off-site releases;

	(4)	Occupational exposure;

	(5)	Costs;

	(6)	Potential safety impact of changes in facility or operational complexity;

	(7)	Resource burden on the NRC; and

	(8)	Potential impact of differences in facility type, design, or age on the relevancy and practicality of the proposed backfit.

C.4	DELINEATION OF CONTRACTOR TASKS

The contractor shall supply the personnel, materials, and facilities necessary to provide services ordered by NRC under individual task order assignment.  Work to be performed will be described in task orders which shall specify the scope of work, deliverables, period of performance, and performance requirements and standards.

Task orders may be issued for rulemaking support in a wide variety of areas.  Types of rulemakings for materials regulation that are now underway or planned are listed in the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions published December 13, 2004.

The work under this contract is estimated to be issued through approximately 5 task orders per year over a 5-year period.  Several task orders could be assigned simultaneously.  The average task order may have a period of performance of approximately 24 chronological months and may average approximately 7.5 staff months of effort, although this estimate could vary substantially from task order to task order.

C.5	USE OF EVALUATIONS FOR ASSESSING PERFORMANCE UNDER INDIVIDUAL TASK ORDERS

Each task order issued under this contract will contain performance requirements and standards.  The method of assessing performance will be the survey contained in Attachment J.7.  The survey will be completed by the NRC Project Officer within sixty days of completion of each task order.  In addition, each task order statement of work will contain a deduction schedule. 

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE

The period of performance of this effort is two-years with an additional three (1) year option periods.

LEVEL OF EFFORT

The NRC's estimate of the total level of effort for the duration of this project is approximately:

75.0 staff months for the two (2) year base period;
37.5 staff months for Option Year 1;
37.5 staff months for Option Year 2;

The U.S. Marine Corps is also planning on procuring eight production aircraft to under the VUAV program.  The Eagle Eye is currently still in the development stage, with its first flight scheduled for the Spring of 2005.  

The Joint Aircraft Survivability Program Office (JASPO) would like to  conduct a preliminary infrared (IR) assessment of the Eagle Eye prototype.  This assessment will enable DoD and DHS to characterize the IR signature and susceptibility of a tactical tilt-rotor class UAV.  Currently, there are no tilt-rotor class UAVs in the inventory, and there is no historical data or characterization of the susceptibility of this type of platform to IR threats.  Tactical UAVs are frequently required to operate in environments where there are IR threats and sensors, either from man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS), night vision equipment, or ships and aircraft equipped with Infrared Search and Track (IRST) sensors.  These UAVs will operate under war and peacetime conditions, conducting Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance for military forces, for homeland defense, and for counter-drug operations.  This baseline assessment will facilitate development of concepts of operations and provide a technical basis for survivability enhancements to the platform.  The Government intends to establish this Sole Source Firm Fixed Price award with Bell Helicopter Textron Inc.  Companies interested in responding to this request for information should mail the following:  a company pamphlet, brochure, or short statement of the company’s abilities/history with this type of service, the name and telephone number of a company representative that can be contacted, and the company’s address.  Once responses are received, interested parties may be requested to provide a presentation to further describe their capabilities.  Written responses to this announcement can be submitted to:

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. Range Instrumentation Systems Squadron (RISS), Air Combat Support Systems Group (ACSSG), Air Armament Center (AAC), Eglin AFB FL, is seeking information from qualified sources interested in the acquisition described below, which will utilize funds from the DEMONSTRATION PROJECT FOR CONTRACTORS EMPLOYING PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES defined as follows. Eligible contractors are those that are operated on a for-profit or non-profit basis that--(A) employ severely disabled individuals at a rate that averages not less than 33 percent of the company?s total workforce over a period prescribed by the Secretary; (b) pays not less than the minimum wage prescribed pursuant to section 6 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C 206) to the employees who are severely disabled individuals; and (C) provides for its employees health insurance and a retirement plan comparable to those provided for employees by business entities of similar size in its industrial sector or geographic region. A severely disabled individual is an individual with a disability as defined in section 3 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S. C 12102)) who has a severe physical or mental impairment that seriously limits one or more functional capacities. If you believe your company can meet all of the requirements of the contract, and of the Demonstration Program, please e-mail the points of contact below with a notification of interest. Please include self-certification that your company meets the disabled employees standards set forth in the above paragraph. Only those companies that meet the requirements defined will be considered for award. Please do not respond to this request for information if your company does not meet the requirements. The Air Force (USAF) anticipates contracting with a company to build to print a new USAF designed hanger band assembly for Air Combat Maneuvering Instrumentation (ACMI) pods. The new hanger band assembly was designed and developed by the USAF for Department of Defense (DOD) use. The new design will replace the current design ACMI pod hanger band assembly system, which utilizes AIM-9 missile hanger band assemblies and hanger band parts. The current design, which is based on the AIM-9 missile, is now known to be composed of a number of life cycle parts which are expensive to maintain in both time and dollars. The new USAF designed hanger band assembly eliminated the current known issue with the current ACMI pod hanger band system and is designed for automated manufacture. The principle manufacturing processes employed in the manufacture of this design include CNC water jet cutting, CNC turning, CNC milling, and welding of non-ferrous metals. The successful contractor will supply all labor and materials to manufacture the new hanger band assembly in accordance with the technical data package with the possible exception of the two 5/16-24 UNJF bolts used in each assembly per DWG 639AS6699, which are DOD unique. The Government may elect to supply these bolts to the contractor as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), due to the Government?s purchasing power of this DOD unique part. The contractor will propose on the manufacture of approximately 900 hanger band assemblies, including a first article which will be inspected and test fit on an ACMI pod under Government direction before the contractor will be approved for production. The contractor will also be required to propose for additional hanger band assemblies in lots of approximately 100, indicating any price breaks for varying quantities. This request for information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). This RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. There is no commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or be responsible for any monies expended by any interested parties for submission packages in response to this RFI. The final requirement, if any, would be defined under a formal Request for Proposal. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities website located at www.fedbizopps.gov. It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any follow-on information. Respondents to this Notice will not be notified of the results of the evaluation of information submitted. 
This RFI has been dually posted to Classification Code 99-Miscellaneous

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

You can email cevans@ccad.army.mil for a complete copy of the RFQ .  A site visit will be scheduled approximately 14 days from the date of issue of the RFQ.  3. Inspection of Hangars  Four types of trusses were identified as shown in Figures 2.1 and 2.2. Every member was labeled for each type and can be located by defining the hangar number, truss type number, truss location on plan drawing, section of the truss, and a unique label. The  most severe problems in the hangars were in the door pockets. Three typical problems were identified in the door pockets: (1) the base beam of some columns were severely corroded, (2) the flange and webs of some columns at the top of concrete walls were  also severely corroded, and (3) diagonal braces were either bent or loose. Recommendations for repair to return damaged members to their original condition, when necessary will be provided in Chapter 7 following the completion of the structural analysis i n Chapter 5.  Deficiencies Reported During Inspection of Hangar 43  The following notes are reported from observations during inspection. These notes are associated with strength reduction and in many cases repair is required. For location of members on plan view of the hangars see Figure 2.3. For member locations on the e levation views see Figures 2.4 and 2.5.  Notes 1 through 3 are for buckled members.  1. T1-J 7/V (Double angle 6 x 3½ x 5/16 x 180 in.)  " Bent vertical member, one angle of the double angle section 2. T2-N 7/V (Double angle 6 x 3½ x 5/16 x 180 in.) " Bent vertical member.  3. T2-A S21 (Double angle 3½ x 2½ x 5/16 x 360.5 in.) " Bent double angle diagonal bracing members.  Notes 4 through 8 are for corroded members with reduced strength.  Corrosion was classified as minor or major depending on the extent of corrosion observed in the member. More frequent painting is recommended to protect structural members from further corrosions. Minor corrosion is estimated to reduce the strength of the member by 5 percent whereas major corrosion is estimated to result in 10 percent reduction in strength of members. Note 9 pertains to estimated strength reduction due to attachments loads by both welds and bolts connection to the columns. The members were not damaged, but a 5 percent strength reduction was considered.  4. All steel members in the hangars open area " Minor corrosion  " 5 percent strength reduction.  5. Column N-S ½ (8-H-31, length: 426 in.)  " Major corrosion at the columns base  " 10 percent strength reduction.  6. Column P-S ½ (12-1-25, length: 426 in.)  " Major corrosion at the columns base  " 10 percent strength reduction.  7. Column A-5 (8-H-31, length: 426 in.)  	" Minor corrosion at the columns base " 5 percent strength reduction.  8. Column AA-4 ½ (12-I-25, length: 426 in.)  " Minor corrosion of the column at the height of the concrete wall, approximately 5 ft above the floor  " 5 percent strength reduction.  9. There are many attachments by both welds and bolts connection to the columns of lines 2 and 4. " Members do not look damaged  " A 5 percent strength reduction was considered.  Repair of Deficient Members Observed During Inspection  This chapter outlines immediate action needed based on observations during inspection, to return damaged members to their original condition. Proposed repair for all deficient members is presented here with illustrative drawings. General notes for proposed  repair techniques are shown in General Retrofit Notes.  Repair in Hangar 43  Notes 1 through 3 are for the buckled members presented in Chapter 2.  For Note 1, repair as shown in Figure D-2. For Notes 2 and 3, it is recommended to replace the damaged existing members with identical or slightly stronger members. The new members shall have the same connection details as the existing members with the same sizes and configurations of bolts and welds (if they exist).  1.	T1-J 7/V (Double angle 6 x 3½ x 5/16 x 180 in.) " Bent vertical member, one angle of the double angle section  " Repair as shown in Figure D-2  " Capacity-demand ratio is less than 0.5.  2. T2-N 7/V (Double angle 6 x 3½ x 5/16 x 180 in.) " Bent vertical member  " Capacity-demand ratio is less than 0.5. 3. T2-A S21 (Double angle 3½ x 2½ x 5/16 x 360.5 in.) " Bent double angle diagonal bracing members  " Capacity-demand ratio is 0.709.  Notes 4 through 8 are for corroded members with reduced strength. Corrosion was classified as minor or major depending on the extent of corrosion observed in the member. More frequent painting is recommended to protect structural members from further corrosion. Minor corrosion is estimated to reduce the strength of the m ember by 5 percent whereas major corrosion is estimated to result in a 10 percent reduction in strength of the members. Note 9 pertains to strength reduction due to load attachments by both welded and bolted connections to the columns. The members reported  in Note 9 were not damaged, but a 5 percent strength reduction was considered.  4. All steel members in the hangars open area  " Minor corrosion  " 5 percent strength reduction  " since capacity-demand ratio is less than 0.5, paint only as recommended in General Retrofit Notes.  5. Column N-S ½ (8-H-Si, length: 426 in.)  " Major corrosion at the columns base  " 10 percent strength reduction  " analysis revealed that this column has a significant margin of safety; thus, paint only as recommended in General Retrofit Notes.  6. Column P-S ½ (124-25, length: 426 in.)  " Major corrosion at the columns base  " 10 percent strength reduction  " analysis revealed that this column has a significant margin of safety; thus, paint only as recommended in General Retrofit Notes.  7. Column A-S ½ (8-H-31, length: 426 in.)  " Minor corrosion at the columns base  " 5 percent strength reduction  " Since capacity-demand ratio is less than 0.5 as a result of the analysis, paint only as recommended in General Retrofit Notes.  8. Column AA-4 ½ (12-1-25, length: 426 in.)  " Minor corrosion of the column at the height of the concrete wall, approximately 5 ft above the floor  " 5 percent strength reduction  " Analysis revealed that this column has a significant margin of safety; thus, paint only as recommended in General Retrofit Notes.  9. There are many attachments by both welds and bolted connections to the columns of lines 2 and 4. The members do not look damaged, but a 5 percent strength reduction was considered. Since capacity-demand ratio is 0.364, no action is recommended for this note.  General Retrofit Notes:  1. The contractor shall provide adequate bracing as required for the stability of the structure during all phases of retrofit/construction. 2: All dimensions, sizes, shapes, and conditions shall be verified before fabrication of new members to ensure proper fit.  3.

<DESC>The above referenced BAA is modified to include a new Focal Challenge -- SRS ARCHITECTURE STUDY.  This modification will solicit a small scale study for the existing IPTO program, Self-Regenerative Systems (SRS).  The SRS program began during the summer of 2004.  Information about SRS can be found on the web at: http://www.tolerantsystems.org/SRSProgram/srs_program.html.  The current program focuses on biologically-inspired diversity, cognitive immunity and regeneration, scalable redundancy, and reasoning about insider threats.  If successful, these technical thrust areas will provide building blocks for new self-regenerative systems.
 
Building blocks alone, however, will not by themselves constitute a system. A system architecture is also required.  A number of concerns will affect the SRS architecture such as formulating architectural structures for exploiting new building blocks, bases for confidence, and boundaries between architectural elements that can be generic and those that must be customized for a specific mission.
 
As many as two independent architecture studies for SRS will be funded.  The size and duration of each of these efforts will be 4 FTE months spread over 2 calendar months.  The studies should be completed before the end of August, 2005.  The study authors should plan on attending the July SRS PI meeting in the Washington DC area.  Study authors should feel free to contact the current SRS performers to discuss their ideas.
 
GENERAL INFORMATION: For those who intend to submit directly in response to this modification to BAA 02-21, Focal Challenge: SRS Architecture Study, the following dates are relevant: 

Abstracts are due by 12:00 NOON (ET), May 11, 2005.  
Proposals are due by 12:00 NOON (ET), June 3, 2005. 
It is strongly encouraged that abstracts be submitted in advance of full proposals.  An offeror who submits an abstract will receive an email encouraging or discouraging the submission of a full proposal.  

Abstracts should be brief (no more than five pages) and should sketch one or more architectural ideas that you wish to develop in more detail in the study.  The abstract should also include a cost estimate (a single number).  The output for a study should be a report describing the architecture in as much detail as possible and justifying the choices made.    

Cover sheets, as described in the basic BAA and Proposer's Information Pamphlet, should indicate the SRS Architecture Study Focal Challenge as the BAA technology area for which the proposal is submitted. Three hard copies and two electronic copies must be submitted to the address contained in the basic BAA. 

Text should be at least 12 point, and page margins should be at least 1 inch.  Offerors are still encouraged to submit other proposals addressing the issues in the basic BAA and to periodically check the Federal Business Opportunities and the IPTO Solicitation web page for possible new Focal Challenges and other modifications.

<DESC>The 45th Contracting Squadron intends to negotiate a contract on a sole source basis with Dynamics Technology, Inc., for Multi-Phenomenology Source Term and Propagation Modeling.  The primary objective of this effort is to develop an integrated modeling suite for prediction and characterizing multi-phenomenology signals emanating from equipment and facilities.  The modeling suite will consist of imported facility models, source term models, and multi-phenomenology propagation models.  The architecture will allow for the easy integration of future source term and propagation models.  The sole source acquisition is justified under 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Evaluation of the contractor’s unique capability and existing products, concluded that the highly specialized effort required is available from only one source.  A cost-plus-fixed-fee contract is contemplated with one-year basic contract period and a 1-year option period.  This effort would require both a facilities and storage capability of at least the SECRET NO FOREIGN level, and the ability to support secure communication capabilities at the SECRET NO FOREIGN level.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and size standard are 541330/$23.0 million.  Reference Note 22 Applies to this synopsis.  No solicitation documents exist at this time.

HSAR 3009.104-75 PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES
[DEC 2003] 

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause.  The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 

(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 

(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

<DESC>The INL has developed a transmission line security monitor and repeater system.  This technology provides real time status of the integrity of the physical structure of power poles, transmission towers and may be applied to other structures, such as pipelines and cell towers.  

The monitoring system is comprised of a multi-sensor platform that is capable of detecting and distinguishing human tampering from natural activities that may pose as threats to tower structures.  This system can provide real time characterization, localization and alarm of potential threats to tower structures.  This system can be integrated with existing infrastructure components.  

The INL is soliciting a written indication of interest from industry partners interested in funding a collaborative technology development project and/or entering into a license agreement for the purpose of developing and commercializing this technology.  

Interested parties should respond thirty (30) days after publication.  Interested parties should send a description of their company and their ability to commercialize this technology to the contact listed below.  Any questions or inquiries should be directed to the contact listed below.

POSITION DESCRIPTION
Background

USAID’s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) has provided more than $157 million in FY 2003 - 2005 to support humanitarian needs in Iraq, including delivering essential medicines to healthcare facilities, providing emergency health services, and rehabilitating water treatment and sewage plants, clinics, hospitals, and schools.  

OFDA has obligated nearly $70 million in Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Funds (IRRF) through FY 2006 to respond to the needs of up to one million internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Iraq, as well as vulnerable populations in communities hosting IDPs.  Interventions aimed at reducing mortality, morbidity, and economic impact associated with displacement will help meet immediate needs, support the longer-term goal of enhancing stability within Iraq and facilitate the return of IDPs to non-contentious areas.  OFDA currently has four international Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) and International Organization (IO) partners.

Introduction

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA). OFDA is organized into three divisions, under the management of the Office of the Director. The Disaster Response and Mitigation (DRM) Division is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations. DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response. The Program Support (PS) Division provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA’s Washington and field offices. The Operations (OPS) Division develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

The Field Officer will be a part of OFDA’s Europe, Middle East and Central Asia (EMCA) regional team within the DRM Division, as well as part of the USAID/DCHA team in Baghdad.

OBJECTIVE

The Field Officer will provide a critical on-the-ground link to OFDA’s implementing partners and to other USG programs.

STATEMENT OF WORK

The Field Officer will be based in Erbil, and work under the supervision of and report directly to the DCHA/OFDA Program Officer, and through that position reports to the Europe, Middle East, and Central Asia (EMCA) team Regional Coordinator, and to the USAID Mission.

The Field Officer will monitor ongoing projects, conduct assessments, coordinate with IDP committees and other USAID programs in Northern Iraq. The Field Officer will also serve as a critical link from Erbil to DCHA/OFDA/Baghdad, reporting on a daily basis on developments and issues related to humanitarian concerns.

The Field Officer is responsible for the following:

1) Field Program Management, Monitoring, and Liaison

Working directly under the Iraq Program Officer, the Field Officer will assist with activities including:

- Coordinate and maintain close liaison with Coalition military forces focused on civil affairs humanitarian activities;
- Serve in an advisory capacity for ongoing planning exercises for humanitarian response in Northern Iraq.  In this capacity, advocate DCHA/OFDA positions on best humanitarian practices and provide technical expertise;
- Coordinate and maintain close liaison with representatives of the Embassy, relevant ministries, donor governments, international organizations, and non-governmental organizations to ensure efficient and coordinated programs;
- Coordinate closely with DCHA personnel and USAID Mission in order to ensure a program that is well integrated with DCHA’s and USAID’s overall objectives;
- Coordinate closely with the Disaster Operations Specialist for Iraq in Washington;
- Assist the DCHA/OFDA Program Officer in Baghdad in managing and monitoring DCHA/OFDA funded activities in Northern Iraq; recommend appropriate relief assistance and emergency interventions;
 -As necessary, assist OFDA/Logistics in coordinating the requests, receipt, distribution, tracking, and accounting of relief supplies provided by OFDA for Northern Iraq;
- Facilitate and coordinate the site visits of additional OFDA/Washington personnel, as necessary;
- Perform other program management, monitoring, and liaison functions as required.

2) Reporting
- Reporting is a critical function of the Field Officer position.  Provide daily written reporting to DCHA/OFDA Baghdad on all aspects of the humanitarian situation, including changing conditions, needs, and humanitarian response activities by Civil Affairs, the Iraqi government, and the humanitarian aid community for Northern Iraq.  Frequent contact with DCHA/OFDA Baghdad by telephone is also necessary but does not substitute for the written reporting requirement.
- Provide talking points and other briefing materials as requested for various field-based entities.
- Continually collect, verify, analyze, and update information on the general situation status, progress of relief activities, areas of concern, and maps from DCHA members and other sources.

3) Security
- OFDA Field Personnel must adhere strictly to Embassy and Mission security guidelines and will coordinate any travel with the DCHA Team Leader, USAID EXO, and other relevant parties.  All travel must be cleared with OFDA’s Washington office as well.  The Field Officer will live and work within the USAID compound in Erbil.


SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:  The Field Officer works under the supervision of the DCHA/OFDA Program Officer in Baghdad.  The Field Officer will report to the Program Officer for day-to-day activities.

POSITION DESCRIPTION
Background

USAID’s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) has provided more than $157 million in FY 2003 and 2004 to support humanitarian needs in Iraq, including delivering essential medicines to healthcare facilities, providing emergency health services, and rehabilitating water treatment and sewage plants, clinics, hospitals, and schools.  

OFDA has obligated nearly $70 million in Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Funds (IRRF) through FY 2006 to respond to the needs of up to one million internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Iraq, as well as vulnerable populations in communities hosting IDPs.  Interventions aimed at reducing mortality, morbidity, and economic impact associated with displacement will help meet immediate needs, support the longer-term goal of enhancing stability within Iraq and facilitate the return of IDPs to non-contentious areas.  OFDA currently has four international Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) and International Organization (IO) partners.

Introduction

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA). OFDA is organized into three divisions, under the management of the Office of the Director. The Disaster Response and Mitigation (DRM) Division is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations. DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response. The Program Support (PS) Division provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA’s Washington and field offices. The Operations (OPS) Division develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).
The Assistant Program Officer (APO) will be a part of OFDA’s Europe, Middle East and Central Asia (EMCA) regional team within the DRM Division, as well as the part of the USAID/DCHA team in Baghdad.

OBJECTIVE

The Assistant Program Officer (APO) provides critical support to the OFDA Program Officer and ensures accurate documentation and reporting on OFDA programs.

STATEMENT OF WORK

The APO is based in Baghdad and is responsible for supporting the Program Officer position, monitoring existing programs, coordinating disaster response activities and identifying and formulating new programs in conjunction with current and possible future OFDA partners in order to fulfill OFDA’s objectives in Iraq.

Raising the profile of OFDA programs within the USAID Mission, the Embassy and the U.S. Government at large is a critical function of this position.  In this role, the APO is responsible for the following:

- Collecting, analyzing, documenting and distributing information on OFDA activities and activities of OFDA partners;
- Coordinating with cooperating agencies;
- Preparing “bullets” for inclusion in USAID daily reports; and
- Assisting with the preparation of briefing papers, operational plans, maps and talking points.

Support for Program Management and Liaison

Working directly under the Iraq Program Officer, the APO will assist with Program Officer activities including providing support to: 

- Coordinate and maintain close liaison with representatives of the Embassy, relevant ministries, donor governments, international organizations, and non-governmental organizations to ensure efficient and coordinated programs;
- Coordinate and maintain close liaison with Coalition forces Civil Affairs units on humanitarian issues;

Reporting

- Provide talking points and other briefing materials as requested for various entities.
- Prepare and clear reporting requirements as appropriate according to identified procedures.  Currently the primary channel for reporting is through development “bullets” for USAID daily reports.  The primary focus of reporting should be on OFDA programs.
- In coordination with the OFDA Program Officer, and through appropriate channels, ensure the Press Officer has access to the most accurate and updated information regarding OFDA programs.

Security
- OFDA Field Personnel must adhere strictly to Embassy and Mission security guidelines and will coordinate any travel outside the “Green Zone” with the DCHA Team Leader, the USAID EXO, and other relevant parties.  All travel outside Baghdad must be cleared with OFDA’s Washington office as well.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)  intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Avcon Industries, Inc., 516 N. Oliver P. O. Box 748 Newton, Kansas 67114 for an aerial photography window without anti-reflective coating.  This is a replacement of the original optical window on the NOAA Citation.  The NOAA Citation is equipped with a window in the fuselage of the aircraft, which isolates the sensors from the exterior environment of the aircraft and provides a means to pressurize the aircraft to the nominal atmospheric pressure from ground level up to an altitude of 41,000 feet while in flight.  The optical window also provides structural support.  The optical window in the Citation is a 4 cm thick glass plate of crown glass, known as BK7.  The glass is of uniform density and is specially manufactured so that the major surfaces are ground flat and parallel to one another.  The optical window is mounted on a rubber gasket in a frame, which prevents side-to-side movement but does not constrain vertical movement.  The mounting arrangement and glass thickness prevent the glass from breaking under pressure.  Notwithstanding the Government’s intent to negotiate this requirement on a sole source basis with Avcon Industries, Inc. under the authority of 41 USC 253 (c) (1), responsible sources may submit a response, which, if timely received will be considered by NOAA.  Responses must be received within 15 days of the posting of this notice.  Responses may be emailed to Pauline.Jaffe@noaa.gov, fax to (301) 713-0806 or mailed to DOC/NOAA/OFA NOS/NMFS/OAR AMD, 1305 East West Highway, Sta. 7168, Silver Spring, MD 20910.

<DESC>The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) seeks sources interested in the design and development of scientifically and technologically robust multiplexed screening assays that can be automated and utilized in a high throughput environment for newborn screening.   NICHD will consider organizations that are capable of performing high-risk, high-gain research for a full range of technologies that include, but are not limited to, chip technologies, microbead technologies, nanotechnologies, microfluidics, DNA arrays, biophysical assays, and/or RNA-based or proteomic-based technologies.  The response should provide insight on the organization’s capabilities to develop technologies that test for genetic conditions, such as inborn metabolic disorders, hematological disorders, congenital endocrinopathies, lysosomal storage disorders, chromosomal disorders (e.g. Fragile-X syndrome), or those characterized through control mechanisms of gene expression (e.g. epigenetics).  In preparing for this response, please review the “Newborn Screening: Toward a Uniform Screening Panel and System” report (http://mchb.hrsa.gov/screening/) recommended by the Secretary’s Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders and Genetic Diseases in Newborns and Children.  The respondent should consider its capability to determine the following issues surrounding the development of the technology: 1) its utility for newborn screening for conditions currently screened within the United States (including its predictive value, sensitivity and specificity); 2) its efficacy of newborn screening for conditions currently screened, comparing the new technology with traditional or alternative techniques; 3) its flexibility (i.e., ability of the technology to be sufficiently and inherently flexible to facilitate expansion of its multiplexing capabilities to include new conditions in the future); 4) its potential for streamlining and full automation to be suitable for population screening; 5) its appropriateness, based on the framework of established screening procedures; and 6) its potential risks and benefits (e.g.. ability to detect genetic variance, clinical heterogeneity, carrier status.)  Responders should also consider using a multidisciplinary approach when responding to this announcement.  Any prospective Offerors who feel they can achieve the objectives of this program should submit a brief response (no more than 10 pages) that demonstrates their capabilities to address the areas above. In addition please provide the business size status of the organization (i.e. educational institution, non-profit, large business, small business, 8 (a), or other corporate or non-corporate entity).  Capability statements (no more than 10 pages excluding resumes) are due within 45 calendar days of the publication of this notice and should be addressed to : Mr. Harvey Shifrin, Contracting Officer, NIH, NICHD, CMB, 6100 Executive Bldg., Room 7A07, 9000 Rockville Pike, MSC 7510, Bethesda, Maryland (if sending by overnight carrier, 6100 Executive Blvd., Rockville, Maryland 20852).   THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  This requirement is classified under NAICS 54171.  Your statement should include an indication whether or not your firm is Small Business, 8(a) or Women Owned and under what NAICS you are qualified.  All responses, an original and 5 copies (if possible an electronic copy, hs35h@nih.gov) should be sent to the address above.   Questions may be e-mailed to Mr. Shifrin at nichdcmb@mail.nih.gov or phoned to 301-435-6963.

FHWA Unknown Foundations Summit
Sources Sought

The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) will sponsor an Unknown Foundations Summit in Denver, Colorado, on November 14-16, 2005, and is seeking technical experts on the nondestructive evaluation of unknown bridge foundations and strategies for managing associated risks. Respondents may be selected for any one or more of the following: to make a presentation at the Summit, to participate in a panel discussion, or to participate as an exhibitor. Interested parties should send contact information and a description of their experience with particular technologies (maximum of 5 double-sided pages or 10 single-sided pages) by May 20, 2005 to:

Attention: Daniel Confer

Background
There are approximately 600,000 roadway bridges over waterways in the United States.    For many of these structures, “as built” information is not unavailable. Consequently, over 80,000 bridges have been identified as having unknown foundations according to the National Bridge Inventory (NBI). Not having foundation information exposes bridge owners and the public to unnecessary risk, congestion, and cost as relatively uninformed decisions are made to prioritize and plan bridge repairs, upgrades, or replacements.  

Characterizing the type, size, depth, configuration, materials, and structure conditions of unknown foundations is essential for (1) scour concerns, (2) structural upgrade/replacements, and (3) seismic retrofitting.  Identifying the type and condition of existing foundations is essential for determining structure repair or upgrade strategies that will effectively reduce safety risks, construction time, and costs.  Furthermore because the number of bridges with unknown foundations is so large, developing effective strategies for managing and characterizing unknown foundations in a practical, economical, and nondestructive manner is critical for realizing these benefits.

In the last decade, several nondestructive techniques have been developed, modified and tested at various sites to evaluate the type, size, depth, configuration, and condition of unknown foundations. Destructive methods such as probing, drilling or digging alongside foundation elements and non-destructive test technologies (NDT) such as seismic, electrical, magnetic, and radar have been evaluated. The actual type of NDT method chosen has been project specific depending on access, foundation configuration, nature of subsurface soils, and the skills and equipment of the practitioner, etc.  NDT methods are cautiously evolving and interpretation is still somewhat subjective based on the interpreter’s judgment and experience.  Few DOT’s and other bridge owner agencies (Forest Service, Park Service, etc.) have conducted evaluation of their unknown foundations in accordance with FHWA guidance. 

FHWA Leadership Role
FHWA recognizes that there is a need for information exchange and guidance to DOTs on unknown foundation evaluation methodologies and their applications, including examples of successes and failures. FHWA is taking a leadership role in establishing this communication and technology transfer. FHWA is advancing the state-of-the-practice through:

1.	Federal, state, and local government and industry forums aimed at identifying, describing, and disseminating technologies and methodologies pertaining to unknown foundation location and characterization.
2.	Establishment of a state-of-the-practice summit on technologies for evaluating unknown foundations.
3.	Support of new technology development.
4.	Continued development of investigation guidelines and training platforms for State DOTs.

Summit Objectives
This summit is aimed at bringing together those parties who have in-depth knowledge, experience, and an interest in identifying appropriate applications and limitations of state-of-the-practice and state-of-the-art technologies for characterizing unknown foundations, as well as strategies for managing unknown foundations and all associated risks. 

The objectives of the summit are to:
 
1.	Provide a forum for open discussion/communication on the state-of-the-art techniques available to manage bridges with unknown foundation and of the current standard-of-practice.
2.	Determine capability, reliability and probable cost of state-of-the-art and state-of-the-practice nondestructive methods for determining types, size, structural condition, configuration, and depths of bridge foundation components.
3.	Develop guidance and management strategies based on the outcome of this meeting for state DOTs and other bridge owners. (A council from all parties will be selected to help develop guidelines at a latter date). 

Who Should Attend
Bridge owners, technology practitioners, university researchers, vendors and consultants of nondestructive evaluation methods; State DOT personnel who have applied various methods for unknown foundations; State DOT personnel who are involved in the management of unknown foundations within the State; and FHWA personnel responsible for facilitating the technology transfer and development of guidelines.

The contractor will have full responsibility for the particular Task which may include machining, assembly and special processes (coatings/painting).  If in-house capability is not available for particular operations the contractor will identify (sub- contractors) out-source operations to complete the requirement.  The out- source operations will be at a minimum compared to in-house capabilities.  The contractor will be the Government's signle point of contact for each Task Order. Typical manufacturing lot sizes may be from (but not limited to) 1 to 200 units. Bench test hardware and unique items may require single unit fabrication.  The contractor shall possess an in-house engineering and design capability for review/revision of drawings to enhance item producibility.  The contractor shall have an in-house quality control/inspection capability to insure the item meets the dimensional and characteristic requirements.  This requirement encompasses a broad range of munition and weapon commodities used by the United States Armed Forces.

GSA SELECTS ARCHITECT FOR DESIGN OF THE RENOVATION OF AN EXISTING BORDER STATION LOCATED IN DERBY LINE, VERMONT

Kieran Timberlake Associates LLP of Philadelphia, PA was chosen from among five  Architect/Engineer Firms in a Two-Stage Design Excellence selection process.
 
The United States Port Facilities at Derby Line are located on U.S. Interstate 91 at the International Border separating Vermont and the Canadian Province of Quebec.  The proposed site surrounds the existing border station with associated secondary buildings, parking areas and State Highway rights- of-way.  This proposed project will be a state-of-the-art facility and should make a distinct architectural statement responsive to the environment and representative of the character and stature of a federal building.  

The Border Station renovation project will provide new port facilities, including the Main Port, commercial, non-commercial and Agency vehicle garages, the demolition of existing Port buildings and completion of site improvements in the area of the existing building. 
 
In making its selection, GSA used a two-stage Design Excellence procurement process. In the first stage, thirty-eight design firms submitted examples of their work and identified a lead designer with his/her portfolio and recently completed work by the firm. From those submissions, an A/E selection panel identified five firms to move onto the stage-two interview phase. The firms and their lead designers were invited to assemble complete A/E teams. The GSA A/E selection panel selected Kieran Timberlake Associates LLP, 420 North 20th Street, Philadelphia, PA  19130.

<SUBJECT>A -- Proposers' Day Briefing
<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Special Projects Office (SPO) anticipates releasing two Broad Agency Announcements (BAAs) during late April 2005 for the Robust Surface Navigation via Signals of Opportunity (RSN) and Sub-Surface Navigation via Signals of Opportunity (SSN) programs.  These two programs, combined, represent the concepts of interest stemming from the Request for Information (RFI) released 11 Feb 2004 entitled Geo-location and Navigation via Signals of Opportunity (NAVSOPP).  The overall goal of these programs is to extend our geo-location and navigation capability to areas where GPS does not provide adequate capability, and to provide these services under conditions of GPS denial.  Phase 1 of each program will consist of identification and assessment of potential exploitable signals, followed by analysis and performance modeling, measurement-based concept validation, and preliminary design.  In Phase 2 the program performers whose designs are selected from Phase 1 will conduct final design, build, and test of prototype receivers and other supporting infrastructure for navigation using the signals of opportunity and special beacons, where required.  This will include demonstration of a non-form/fit functional prototype system in multiple environments.  The specific goal of the RSN program is to develop technologies that will enable our warfighters to have GPS-like navigation under conditions of GPS denial and in difficult environments where GPS does not provide adequate performance.  These environments include inside buildings, urban canyons, and under dense foliage.  Since GPS signals do not penetrate or are obscured by multipath propagation in these environments, RSN expects to use existing terrestrial and space based signals (such as broadcast TV, AM/FM radio, and cellular phone networks) as a basis for navigation.  A key desired feature is the ability of the system concept and architecture to exploit these signals as globally and as non-intrusively as possible.  DARPA envisions the capability to span the range of user platforms from airborne fast-movers to sensors and ground forces in urban interiors.  It should use a layered approach that uses, for example, signal-of-opportunity “calibration reference” ground stations at maximum practicable standoff for wide area coverage, but that can easily and smoothly transition to more intrusive active beacons as necessary to augment the signals of opportunity when they are inadequate for the task. The specific goal of the SSN program is to develop technologies that will enable our warfighters to have GPS-like navigation and stationary asset geo-location in sub-surface environments such as underground facilities, tunnels, mines, and unimproved caves.  Ideally, SSN would use existing “signals of opportunity,” as RSN does.  However, DARPA realizes that very few signals penetrate the ground enough to be usable.  Thus the SSN program recognizes that purpose-deployed signal beacons and inertial navigation sensors or other augmentation will take on a greater role, and that the characteristics of these solutions are likely inconsistent with a more general receiver and architecture that make it a broadly applicable and efficient global solution for all above-ground navigation, as in RSN. SECURITY:  Work under RSN and SSN will be classified at the collateral SECRET level.  Proposers must have the required United States personnel clearances, cleared facilities, storage, and processing capabilities to submit a proposal for this solicitation. 
DARPA intends to hold a Proposers’ Day Briefing for the RSN and SSN BAAs on 11 May 2005 at the Booz Allen Hamilton conference facility in Arlington, VA.  Attendance is limited.  Potential proposers should indicate their interest via e-mail to SN05-21@darpa.mil.  This meeting will be classified SECRET.  All attendees at the Proposers’ Day Briefing must be pre-approved and pre-registered, including having valid United States security clearances in place before the meeting starts.  The deadline for receipt of classified visit certifications is 4 May 2005.  All questions regarding attendance should be emailed to SN05-21@darpa.mil.

Statement of Work

Train Network Management System Development-- Technical Support for Demonstrations of Locomotive Emergency Egress, Locomotive Security System and Advanced Concept Train


Overview of Train Demonstrations— Locomotive Emergency Egress, Advanced Concept Train and Locomotive Security System

The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) Office of Research and Development proposes to build a five-car train to demonstrate new freight car technology systems that FRA has been developing during the past several years. The demonstration covers three areas from three separate program areas—Rolling Stock and Equipment, Train Occupant Protection and Train Security.  FRA has developed Emergency Egress concepts for locomotives. The roof hatch, removable windshield, detachable door hinge and the Automatic Collision Notification System were developed under the Train Occupant Protection Program to improve locomotive crew safety.  FRA proposes to demonstrate these concepts as part of the demonstrations.  The objective of the Advanced Concept Train (ACT) Project is to develop and demonstrate advanced systems for continuously monitoring and remotely controlling freight car mechanical components to improve freight rail transportation safety and efficiency. This includes the use of Electrically Controlled Pneumatic (ECP) Braking.  The program is part of the Rolling Stock Program Element in FRA's Five-Year Strategic Plan for Railroad Research, Development and Demonstrations.  The Locomotive Security System (LSS) is part of the Train Security Program.  The objective of the LSS is to develop and demonstrate advanced concepts to prevent unauthorized operation of locomotives.

During FY 2003 FRA purchased an EMD GP40-3 EM2000 computer controlled locomotive for these projects.   FRA proposes to acquire five freight cars on loan from co-operating railroads for the Advanced Concept Train Demonstration projects. The five freight cars will be equipped with sensors to monitor the following components:

·	Bearings (vibration signature and temperature)
·	Trucks (ride quality and hunting)
·	Wheels (flat and out-of-round)
·	Brakes (piston travel)
·	Car Ride Quality (all three directions)

The freight cars will also be equipped with actuators to remotely control the following components:

·	Coupler
·	Cut-levers
·	Angle-cocks
·	Advanced cushioning device
·	Advanced handbrake

The FRA also plans to equip the ACT locomotive and freight cars with stand alone hard-wired AAR S-4200 compliant Electronically Controlled Pneumatic (ECP) brakes.  FRA purchased New York Air Brake’s EP-60 ECP brakes along with locomotive CCB-II brakes to control braking. FRA also plans to upgrade the locomotive to provide locomotive systems for on-board monitoring for safe and efficient maintenance and operation. The ACT locomotive (GP-40-3) will be modified to incorporate a Locomotive Security System (LSS).

An IEEE 802-11b based two-way wireless intra-train communication system will link the freight cars to the locomotive. The communication system enables the freight cars to transmit safety alarms and status information to the locomotive and to receive commands and information requests from the locomotive. When a defect affecting train safety is detected, a safety alarm will be sent to the locomotive to alert the engineer.  Non-critical defects detected during normal operations are flagged and reported for maintenance. The freight car sensor data will also be linked to a remote database server through a wireless telecommunications system.  The database server will be accessible via the Internet.  FRA currently has five cars equipped with the on-board monitoring system operating in a revenue service demonstration in co-operation with Southern Company and Norfolk Southern Corporation.  The experience gained with that demonstration will be extended to the ACT.

Integrating Locomotive Display/Computer Systems with ECP Braking and the ACT Monitoring and Control System

FRA has reviewed available locomotive computer systems for use in the ACT Demonstration Project. The FRA GP-40-3 locomotive is an Electro-Motive Diesel (EMD) built locomotive with the EM-2000 computer. The EMD Functionally Integrated Railway Electronics (FIRE) locomotive display and cab computer with integrated Communications Management Unit (CMU) and IntelliTrain remote monitoring system is uniquely qualified to support the FRA ACT project.  The FIRE locomotive display and cab computer is built on a Microsoft Windows embedded XP platform and is designed to operate in the locomotive cab environment.  The FIRE computer uses an EMD proprietary inter-process communication protocol known as NetCore, which is based on a TCP/IP network socket bus architecture.  The FIRE computer CMU supports numerous wireless communications technologies, including 1xRTT and GPRS packet switched cellular, CDMA circuit switched cellular, and 802.11b wireless LAN.  The FIRE computer integrated CMU and NetCore messaging protocol is employed to seamlessly exchange data between the locomotive and remote databases.  EMD has created a FIRE Developer’s Kit (FDK) that provides a set of tools to support development of third party applications for the FIRE locomotive display and cab computer. The FDK will facilitate development of software for the ACT demonstration.

In view of the above FRA is seeking a contractor to support the ACT development team in developing the necessary software and to provide related technical support to install the software on the locomotive FIRE computers installed on the FRA GP-40-3 locomotive. The required software and its function for each of the specific tasks are described in detail below:

TASKS

Task 1: Train Network Management System Development for Actuator Remote Control and On-Board Sensor Monitoring

a) Messaging Protocol Development for communication between the freight cars and the locomotive FIRE computer and locomotive applications 

The contractor shall support the ACT development team in developing a messaging system for two-way communication between the locomotive and the freight cars and between the locomotive and remote database servers.  The messaging system will be based on an open protocol such as Object Management Group (OMG) Data Distribution Service (DDS).  The messaging system software shall run on the FIRE computer to support operation of various graphical user interfaces for controlling advanced components and displaying monitoring system data and two-way messaging between the locomotive and the ACT freight cars.
b) Graphical User Interfaces on Locomotive FIRE computers
The contractor shall support the ACT development team in developing graphical user interfaces (GUI) on the FIRE computer to control the advanced components (hand brakes, cut levers, angle cocks, etc.) and display information from the passive monitoring system.
c) Transmitting OBMCS (sensor) data to web accessible database server
The contractor shall develop software for the locomotive FIRE computers to transmit car sensor data and pertinent locomotive data (locomotive health status, fuel data, asset tracking) to a web accessible database server when required. The On-Board Monitoring and Control System also provides a direct path to the web accessible database server.  The software shall use the messaging system developed in a).
d) ACT Hazard Analysis
The contractor shall provide engineering technical support to assist with conducting a hazard analysis of the ACT system, particularly the intra-train wireless communication system between the locomotive and the ACT freight cars.  A report describing the Hazard Analysis shall be written and submitted to the FRA.

Task 2:  Locomotive Security System

In recent times there has been a heightened concern about railroad security in the US.  One area of particular concern is the vulnerability of locomotives and trains to operation by unauthorized individuals and the potential use of a train as a terrorist weapon.  It would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to stop a loaded train carrying hazardous material, going 70 MPH, in a populated urban area by any means other than by derailing it.  At the very least, this would result in significant property damage and be extremely disruptive to America’s railroad transportation system. FRA, has identified the risk of using a locomotive/train as a terrorist weapon and the unique challenge faced by the railroads to secure their locomotives and infrastructure.

Because many different personnel operate locomotives and they are often interchanged between railroads, locomotives are not equipped with an ignition key like an automobile.  Instead, locomotives are equipped with a universal removable "Reverser" handle that is mechanically interlocked with the locomotive "Throttle" handle.  The "Reverser" handle is inserted into a slot in the locomotive controller mechanism in order to operate the locomotive. Because the "Reverser" handle is designed to be interchangeable between locomotives, a lost, misplaced, stolen or duplicated "Reverser" handle could be used by an unauthorized individual to operate any standard freight or passenger locomotive in North America.  Locomotive cabs are also equipped with door locks, however they are seldom used, especially when the locomotives are being operated.  In any case, they would provide little protection against an armed terrorist determined to hijack a locomotive.

To address these security risks and prevent unauthorized operation of locomotives, FRA would like to develop and demonstrate a Locomotive Security System.  The system, as envisioned, would utilize electronic ID technology, such as SmartCards, to authenticate the identity of a certified locomotive engineer/operator.  If the operator fails to authenticate properly, a full service penalty brake would be initiated by the LSS to stop the train and prevent operation of the locomotive The contractor shall develop a prototype system for application to the FRA Advanced Concept Train Locomotive. The contractor shall provide technical support to install, test and verify operation of the LSS. 

Locomotive Security System Concept

The LSS, as envisioned, would use an electronic ID (e.g. smartcard) to prevent unauthorized operation of a locomotive.  In the basic embodiment of the system, authorized locomotive operators would be issued an electronic ID and their own unique PIN.  The PIN is encrypted so that the ID card can not be duplicated if lost or stolen.  The locomotive would be equipped with an electronic ID card reader and keypad.  The electronic ID card readerwould interface to the LSS computer.  The LSS computer would  prevent operation of the locomotive unless a valid PIN is entered by the locomotive operator. A functional discussion follows.

Each time the locomotive comes to a stop, the locomotive operator must enter his PIN before the LSS computer will allow the locomotive to be operated.  While the locomotive is moving, the locomotive operator must periodically enter his PIN.  If the locomotive operator fails to enter the correct PIN, the LSS computer will send a signal to the locomotive airbrake system to initiate a penalty brake application.  A penalty brake application will result in removal of locomotive traction power and the reduction of brake pipe pressure to zero psi at a service rate.  

An optional distress message can automatically be transmitted to alert authorities of unauthorized locomotive operation when an incorrect PIN is entered or when a special PIN is entered (e.g. backward PIN).

In another embodiment of this invention, operator biometric information (e.g. fingerprint) is stored on the electronic ID.  The locomotive is equipped with an electronic ID card reader and corresponding biometric scanner (e.g. fingerprint reader).  The operation is identical to that described above using a PIN to authenticate locomotive operation except that a biometric scan is conducted instead of a PIN being entered by the operator. Periodic reaffirmation can be incorporated with the ALERTER system. The handle may be equipped with a fingerprint scanner which will allow the locomotive engineer/operator continuing authentication. 

As part of this work, the FRA GP40-3 locomotive shall be equipped with an Electro-Motive FIRE™ Locomotive Cab Computer and Display (LCC&D).  FRA proposes to further utilize this locomotive to implement a prototype LSS with capabilities to use either a PIN or a fingerprint for operator authentication.

The proposed locomotive security system shall use an electronic ID card that contains the operator’s encrypted personal identification number (PIN) and fingerprint information.  The locomotive security system shall be integrated with the brake system.  The locomotive will be equipped with both an electronic ID card reader and a finger print scanner.  The FIRE™ computer shall be used to implement the LSS algorithms and for operator PIN input.  

The operator must insert his/her ID card into the electronic ID card reader and input his/her PIN, or place his/her index finger on the fingerprint scanner, before operating the locomotive.  If the operator does not enter the correct PIN, or the fingerprint authentication fails, the locomotive security system will initiate a full service penalty brake application.  During operation of the locomotive, the operator will be asked to periodically enter his/her PIN into the system or place their finger on the fingerprint scanner in order to prevent a penalty brake application from being activated by the LSS.

A task report describing the Locomotive Security System shall be prepared and delivered to FRA for review and comment. This report shall be revised and submitted for final distribution. The prototype hardware shall be delivered for installation and support provided for installation of the same.

Deliverables

Task Deliverables 

The contractor shall document and make available to FRA all applicable software developed as part of this work. The rights to use any proprietary software incorporated into the Train Network System shall be granted to the Government.  The deliverables for each task are listed with each task.

Enclosure for RFQ-CAZ-05-035:

Background: The RMRS Rocky Mountain Center http://fireweather.info currently provides 24/7 operational weather predictions to the forest fire management community in the western US.  The existing Linux cluster system is set up to run the MM5 and WRF mesoscale weather models plus several pre and post processing programs like BlueSky and LAPS (see web page).  It consists of:

1. A Dual Athlon 2400MP 2.0 GHz PowerWulf Beowulf Linux cluster  (1 head node; 15 slave nodes) purchased from PSSC Labs March 2003 with custom installation of Beowulf cluster software (CBeST) including setup of OS, message passing software (MPI CH), LAPACK Libraries, BLAS Libraries, FFW, VLISP, GNU Compilers, Custom OS Kernel, and Ganglia cluster monitoring utility and Graphical User Interface tools. Security patches including preconfigured Port Mapper, IP Chains and Security Errata Updates (Redhat 7.3) used for protection. 

2. A Dual Xeon 3.06 PowerWulf Beowulf Linux - Intel Xeon 7501 Chipset Motherboard / 533 Mhz FSB (1 head node; 31 slave nodes) purchased from PSSC Labs, Inc July 2004 with custom installation of CBeST v. 3.0 Beowulf cluster software including setup of OS with custom kernel for performance optimization; message passing software (MPI CH), LAPACK Libraries, BLAS libraries; custom script for node reboot, Poweroff & File Copy across cluster; GNU Scientific Compilers; Ganglia cluster monitoring utility and Graphical User Interface tools Security patches including preconfigured port mapper, IP Chains and Security Errata Updates (Redhat 7.3) are included for protection. System Imager for remote installation/update of software across the network. Custom script for node reboot. Open PBS batch scheduling system.  LM Sensors monitoring for cpu temp and fan speed (when supported).  Linux version configured for Beowulf cluster including installation of MPI CH of MPI and/or PVM. 

The Dual Athlon 2400MP head node serves as the overall system master node using the 15 Athlon slaves and the 31 Xeon slaves through two linked (one 48 and one 24 port) gigabit switches.  The Xeon 3.06 head node is the hot backup master and is also used for several post processing programming tasks.  Each master has a Dell PowerVault 220S High-Performance Storage system and the master has a Certance 2U Rackmount Viper 2 LTO 400 200/400GB LTO, SCSI LVD w/ Bru backup system.  RMC will switch to using the Xeon as the system master and the Athlon as the hot backup prior to this purchase. 

RMC makes two 10-hour runs per day, 11am and 11 pm.  RMC SOP allows for hardware and software maintainance, adding components, etc. between 9 and 11 in the morning and/or night.  RMC anticipates taking the system down over a weekend period skipping one run, from 11 am to 11 pm for the installation of the components from this procurement.  

The existing systems warranties are for one year full parts and labor plus a three year extended component manufacturers warranty.  The existing supplier’s cluster technicians provide free phone support and consultation for lifetime of these machines.

Requirements:  

A. General:
1.	nodes must have Intel chips for compatibility with existing nodes and the new nodes must work with the old nodes.
2.	nodes must be installed with a 32-bit OS and OS on new nodes must be compatible with OS on existing nodes
3.	new nodes must be seamlessly networked together with existing nodes so that MPI runs will function across the entire cluster 
4.	All of the new components must be able to communicate and support with existing raid system and back up system.
5.	All nodes must be preconfigured with OS CBeST combatable software before shipping to ensure seamless integration, ability to install over the network and have upgradability to handle additional nodes. This also requires two Ethernet ports and the ability for the BIOS to handle a net install.

B. Specific:

1.	The twelve (12) additional nodes (item 1) must be configured with 64 bit Xeon processors and integrated into the existing Beowulf Linux Cluster that is currently using both 32 bit AMD Athlon processors and 32 bit Xeon processors and running 32 bit OS and 32 bit CBeST toolkit.  Therefore the OS and CBeST or CBeST combatable must initially be installed as a 32 bit platform. New nodes must be configured with same 32 bit image as the existing nodes.   Eventually these nodes may be upgraded to a 64 bit system.
2.	The 12 upgraded nodes (item 2) must use existing 2U slave and 3U master rackmounted chassis preferably employing the existing cooling technology that allows airflow cooling to ensure proper processor, memory and hard disk temperatures.  The 12 node upgrade, one master node and 11 slave nodes, must be delivered with software combatable with the current (CBeST software) to ensure seamless integration and compatibility with existing system.  The master node for this system will immediately serve as a back up to the existing Xeon 3.06 Master 3.  Hence it will initially be configured with a 32 bit Linux OS.  This master will eventually be upgraded to a 64 bit OS with combatable software to act as the master node for eleven (11) 64 bit slave nodes, 47 @ 32 bit slave nodes and 32 bit head node plus any additional 64 bit slave nodes added in the future.
3.	RMC does not have the manpower nor software support necessary to integrate the new components without nodes that are preinstalled with OS and CBeST or CBeST combatable software.  The original provider, PSSC Labs, http://www.pssclabs.com/ can be contacted to consult with vendors to ensure the successful integration of a functioning system.
4.	These new products can not be refurbished and must include full manufacturer’s warranty.
5.	If Vendor can not meet specifications as will be determined after the 12 hour installation and subsequent weather model run, they will be required to send a technician onsite and integrate all products to our satisfaction before payment is made.  This must be done between 11 am and 11 pm on any weekend not to exceed three consecutive weekends. There will be no additional payment for this support.
6.	Payment will be made after items 1 and 2 are demonstrated to be fully integrated and functional.

Qualifications:  

Vendor must have been in business for a minimum of 5 years.

Vendor must have previously delivered Beowulf Linux Clusters to ensure they are proficient and capable of supporting RMC current and future HPC needs.

Vendors must include a minimum of 4 references that can and will be contacted to discuss their experience with similar systems by that vendor.

The vendor must have capability necessary to keep the support and maintenance of the cluster standard with existing system and provide free phone/email support for the lifetime on the system for operating system, CBeST combatable toolkit, MM5 and WRF support.

Vendor must have installed MM5 and WRF on their own system and show that they are proficient in supporting scientists using these models.

<DESC>This amendment is issued to provide Final Questions/Answers to Solicitation 05MSD7039
The deadline to submit quotes is 2:00 p.m. EST, April 20, 2005.
1. Question:  What do you mean by a Steadi-lens? 
    Answer:  A lens with internal image stabilization.
2a. Question: Is that a Gyrolens used for shooting in helicopters? 
    Answer:  Yes 
  b. Question: If so, will there be a tyler mount for the camera? 
    Answer: There will not be a Tyler mount.
3. Question: Your description in the production, it states that the government will provide a DigiBeta field deck. I will be providing through my bid, 2 Beta/sp packages complete with audio and camera support. My question is, are you going to be recording to those DigiBeta decks that you are providing?  If so, with the current configuration that the cameras will in, you will be receiving a NTSC signal from the output of the Beta/sp deck (BNC out). If the DigiBeta decks that you are providing are to be the prime recorders, then I might recommend that you configure the cameras with a back that allows a multi-pin adapter that ends in RGB connectors to connect into your Digibeta decks (higher quality signal). If that is the case, then I have to include that into my bid. Then you could use the Beta/sp backs for any kind of B-roll that requires a lot of moving around.
    Answer: The DigiBeta Field desk is for another Government provided camera and not part of this Statement of Work.
4. Question: I am assuming that when you say you provide tape that you will provide both Beta/sp for the Beta/sp backs and Digibeta tape for your Digibeta recorders? 
    Answer:  Yes
5. Question: Will this be a live switch shoot (will the cameras run through a switcher)?
    Answer:  No
6. Question: We have a portable studio where you can switch back and forth to each camera will this production require something like that? 
    Answer: No
7. Question: Will all the footage be shot outside? 
    Answer: Yes
8. Question: Will this production require Hand held Microphones and Lapelled Microphones? 
    Answer: No, camera mounted mics only
9. Question: How far is Artesia, NM from Taos, NM?
     Answer: Don’t know.  Can look it up on ‘Map Tech’
10. Question: Will this Production Require Lighting?
     Answer: No. This is all shot outside so natural light will be used. 
11. Question: If weather does not allow us to shoot production will a extra day be added on? 
     Answer: Possibly, (TBD)
12. Question: According to the RFP, it appears that you are depending totally on "on board" camera microphones.  Is there a particular reason for this, or would you like for us to provide wireless lavaliere mics for individuals and boom mics for group shots, etc.? You will receive much better sound with using the lavs and booms and there would be no additional charge for this.
    Answer: No
13. Question: Approximately, how many will be acting as talent (in front of the camera) at one time? This will be helpful in determining the number of mics needed should you decided to go with the lav/boom option. 
    Answer: None needed.
14. Question: Will you need a teleprompter for talent? 
     Answer: No
15. Question: Is everything to be shot outside in natural light or is there need for a lighting set up, i.e. inside a training center, etc.?
     Answer: Everything will be shot outside.  This is a driver training course.  There is no need for a lighting set up. 
16. Question: We noticed that the "government will provide a steadi-lens, field deck and tape." Since they are not providing the camera, would it be possible for us to simply provide the entire camera package ourselves to ensure that the lens indeed fits the camera, etc.? There would be no difference in cost to you. It would simply avoid any unforeseen compatibility problems. 
    Answer: The stedi-lens will be mounted on the contractor’s camera for aerial shoot.  There will be no Tyler mount.
17. Question: We are capable of shooting in any format. Are you opposed to DVCAM or are you absolutely set on Digibeta or Beta SP? (Regardless of what format it is shot on, we can still provide the final product on any format - Digibeta, Beta SP, DVD, etc.) 
    Answer:  Yes, Government is opposed to DVCAM.
18. Question: As we understand the RFP, there is to be no editing. Is this correct? If you decided ultimately that you would like to edit this project and add an opening and closing, for example, we have a full state-of-the-art editing facility at your fingertips. 
    Answer:  No editing.  The Government has its own editor.
19. Question: Would the client be willing to allow a different tape/camera format – specifically DV.
    Answer: No
20.  Question: What is the closest airport to Artesia, NM?  Is it Calsbad, NM?  
    Answer: Roswell, NM.
21. Question: Only one steadi-lens and one Digibeta Field Deck is listed but two cameramen are required, what will the other Camera be using? 
    Answer: Steadi-lens and one Digibeta Field Deck is provided by the Govt. The request is for two complete camera packages of DigiBeta or BetaSP.
22. Question: Will it be the camera back?  
    Answer: No
23a. Question: In the equipment list it requests either Digibeta or Beta-Sp.  I don't think you want to mix these formats.  That being said will the Government be supplying more than one field deck? 

    Answer:  We don't plan to mix formats. The contractor must provide either 2 complete Digibeta camera packages or 2 complete BetaSP camera packages.

    b. Question: If so what will be the format? 

       Answer: Dependant upon contractor's bid.

24. Question: Is the steadi-lens a 2/3" Sony Bayonet type? 

    Answer: Yes

25. Questions: Your synopsis/solicitation for the New Mexico video production shoot is pretty self-explanatory. However, before I send in a proposal I want to make sure that you do not need boom or wireless microphones for interviews. The synopsis indicates camera mics, which normally are used for recording natural sound only, i.e the squeal of tires going around a track, dog barking, etc. They aren't used for ON-CAMERA interviews. You're not requesting this or sound technicians either. But I just wanted to make certain before I responded. 

    Answer: This is an outside shoot of cars on the Driver Training Courses.  We will be using natural sound only. No additional mics are needed and no sound technicians are needed.

26. Question: Does contractor need to provide camera mounts for helicopter shots?  

    Answer: No

27. Question: Can these training videos be shot on a  SONY DVCAM Format rather than DigiBeta? 

    Answer: No. Only Digibeta or BetaSP.

28. Question: Does contractor need to provide camera mounts for helicopter shots?

     Answer: No

29. Question: That TWO complete crews (two camera operators with gear and two grips) are needed for each week of production and not two crews split between the two weeks.  

    Answer: Two complete crews for each week.
 
30. Question: We would like to confirm that no special equipment such as color monitors, HMI lights, wireless microphones or wide angle lens will be needed for this shoot.  

    Answer: No
 
31. Question: What level of expertise do you expect for the grips? 

    Answer: We expect them to be a high level professional. 

32. Question: Am I correct in assuming from the Solicitation that the grips will be doing basic production work, such as holding reflectors, running cables, moving the camera, etc.? Or, do you anticipate more complex tasks for the grips, such as exterior car mounts for the cameras, etc.?

    Answer: They will be mounting exterior car mounts.

33. Question: Will you be evaluating the responses on price, experience of the crew, experience of the production company, or some combination of these? 

    Answer:  A combination of these.

34. Question: Is lunch included in the ten hour workday, i.e., nine hours shooting and one hour lunch? 

    Answer: Lunch is available on-site but will not be paid for by the Government.

35. Question: When you say equipment requirements include “all other accessories to complete a 5 day exterior shoot,” do you mean only camera accessories, or do you want items such as reflectors, stands, sandbags, silks, etc.? 

    Answer: This bid is for two 5 day shoots with a non-work weekend between. 

36. Question: Are you willing to shoot with other than Beta SP or DigiBeta cameras, with all footage transferred to BetaSP or DigiBeta for delivery to you? For instance, shoot with DVC Pro cameras with transfer to Beta SP, or shoot with DVC Pro HD with transfer to DigiBeta? 

    Answer: No

37. Question: How do you plan to utilize the DigiBeta field deck during the shoot? 

    Answer: The contractor in conjunction with the onsite Govt. representative will mount a Govt. provided lipstick camera using Govt. provided grip equipment to the undercarriage of a 4 x 4 Govt. provided vehicle.  The video signal will be run into the DigiBeta deck which will be in the interior of the vehicle.

38a. Question: Is lowest price the deciding factor?

    Answer:  No, best value for the Government is the deciding factor.

  b. Question: If not what other factors are you taking into consideration.

    Answer:  See answer #1.

39.  Question: Besides price, do you want references included in the bid ? 

    Answer: No

40. Question: If we direct you to the company website, will that be factored in your judging the proposal?

    Answer:  No

41. Question: You talk about shooting out of helicopters are you aware that special mounts are sometimes used to maximize the quality of such video?

    Answer:  We are aware however we can not use mounts in the helicopter available.

42.  Question: If the shoot is shorter than 5 days will the government pay the difference to change the airline tickets?

    Answer:  No

43.  Question: How much of a chance is there that the shoot would be extended beyond  5 days?

    Answer:  Very little, however, in case of extreme delays caused by weather or other factors, additional days may be added and the contract modified.

44. Question: What about hotels? 

    Answer: Resources are available on the internet.  Government does not make reservations or provide housing for contractors.

45. Question: Everyone’s definition of a grip is different, can you qualify that especially since lighting is not called for?

    Answer: We expect them to demonstrate a high level of professional skill such as being able to mount exterior car mounts.

6 		PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

The management of solid waste in India has been neglected by both industry regulators and urban local bodies, resulting in the disposal of municipal solid waste (MSW) on the streets and the unauthorized disposal of hazardous, bio-medical and toxic waste.  In India, MSW is collected irregularly by sanitation workers and deposited at open waste storage depots resulting in unsanitary conditions.  Further transportation, dumping and disposal takes place in an unhygienic and unscientific manner, which causes land, water and air pollution.  India produces 36.5 million tons of MSW a year, 94% of which is dumped on land, the other 5% being composted.  Out of 4,378 urban areas in the country, more than 100,000 tons of waste is produced each day, of which 20% to 50% is not collected at all by the cities. The Ministry of Environment and Forests has approved the Municipal Waste Management and Handling Rules 2000 yet strategic interventions and technical support are necessary to improve compliance and enforcement.  Many State Industrial Development Corporations are seeking assistance from international companies and consultants for the establishment of waste management facilities.
  
	The management situation of other waste remains critical.  Indiscriminate dumping of hazardous waste and the proper storage, transport, disposal and treatment of biomedical waste remains a problem for many urban areas.  It is predicted that the management of hazardous waste will become more critical in the future as waste generation from rapid industrialization and urbanization increases.  There have been a number of regulatory efforts made on behalf of the Government through the Environment Protection Act and Biomedical Waste Rules.  Unfortunately, the implementation of effective hazardous waste management systems is poor.  Major hazardous waste producing industries in India include chemicals, petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, agricultural chemicals, paper plants, paints, dyes, petroleum, tanneries, textile processing plants, distilleries, and heavy metal industries. The waste that is produced by these industries must be disposed of in secured landfills, the toxic organic part of which must be incinerated.  Aside from these traditional incineration methods other modern hazardous waste management techniques are relatively unknown in India.  Therefore, there is a vast opportunity for U.S. exporters in the area of cyanide waste, distillation waste, incineration of solid, liquid and gaseous waste, pyrolysis technology waste minimization, and bio-filtration and oxidation technologies.  

It is expected that the DM Contractor for this activity will travel to at least two cities within India, most likely including New Delhi and Mumbai.  The Contractor will meet with the key government and private sector entities, including the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), State Pollution Control Boards (SPCB), Industrial Development Corporations, Pollution Control Committees (PCC) and the State Departments of Environment.  Other key entities include the Chief Engineers at Solid Waste Management Department, Health Officers at local Municipal Corporations, the Secretary of Health, the Haldia Development Authority, and the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOEF).  

The DM Contractor would coordinate meeting plans with the Foreign Commercial Service in designated cities.  The Contractor will identify potential USTDA funded projects involving municipal solid waste management and hazardous, bio-medical, and toxic waste management.  The Contractor will give high priority to identifying private sector project sponsors as potential USTDA Grantees.  The deliverable will be a DM Final Report that provides a full assessment of at least two projects.  


 
Annex I

IMPACT ON U.S. LABOR STATEMENT

The Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs Appropriations legislation restricts U.S. foreign assistance from being used to provide: (a) any financial incentive to a business enterprise currently located in the United States for the purpose of inducing such an enterprise to relocate outside the United States if such incentive or inducement is likely to reduce the number of employees of such business enterprise in the United States because United States production is being replaced by such enterprise outside the United States; (b) assistance for any project or activity that contributes to the violation of internationally recognized workers rights; and (c) direct assistance for establishing or expanding production of any commodity for export by any country other than the United States, if the commodity is likely to be in surplus on world markets at the time the resulting productive capacity is expected to become operative and if the assistance will cause substantial injury to United States producers of the same, similar, or competing commodity.

The Contractor shall analyze the potential procurement of U.S. goods and services for project implementation by categories and dollar values.  The analysis shall include an assessment of the project risks and its financial viability, the priority of the project and political/social/organizational support it has, potential sources of financing, and the capability and experience of the project sponsor.  The analysis shall also include an assessment of the social and economic development impacts of the proposed project.

2.6		USTDA REPORT OBJECTIVES

If the Contractor recommends that USTDA fund the study(ies) in a phased approach, and/or if any outstanding issues should be resolved or conditions met before funding is approved, those phases, issues and/or conditions should be clearly explained in the recommendation.

2.6.1		The Contractor shall provide a final report to the USTDA, which will: 

2.6.1.1		assess and justify whether or not USTDA should provide funding for a study of the proposed project(s); 

2.6.1.2		 assess any alternative or other activities which the Contractor sees as viable options for USTDA consideration; and 

2.6.1.3	          provide recommendations on the above information in a final report that analyzes all relevant issues

2.6.2		Contractor recommendations shall be based upon USTDA funding criteria, which are that the project must: 

2.6.2.1 	be likely to receive implementation financing, and in addition, have a procurement process that provides “equal access” to U.S. firms;

2.6.2.2		represent an opportunity for sales of U.S. goods and services that is many times greater than the initial investment of USTDA assistance;

2.6.2.3		be a development priority of the project sponsor and country where the project is located and have the endorsement of the U.S. Embassy in that nation; and

2.6.2.4		involve U.S. companies that are facing market entry problems and/or strong competition from foreign companies, which often receive subsidies, and other support from their governments.

As part of this review, the Contractor is required to contact officials from the potential financing institutions, including, where appropriate, multilateral lending institutions, Ex-Im Bank, OPIC, and private/commercial sources, to assure that the project sponsors have adequately explored their financing options.  The Contractor shall provide names and phone numbers of contacts at the potential lending institutions and summarize their comments.  The Contractor must determine the most likely source(s) of implementation financing and ensure that the terms of reference for any proposed study fulfill the requirements of the most likely source(s), or suggest appropriate revisions to ensure that they do.  

3.5		U.S. EXPORT POTENTIAL (1-2 PAGES)

The contractor shall discuss the extent to which market entry issues impede trade and how the project will help overcome these obstacles.

3.7	 	DEVELOPMENTAL IMPACT (2-3 PAGES)
