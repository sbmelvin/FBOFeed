<DESC>NASA/SSC has a requirement for services for the "Application of Contractor-Developed CRUNCH CFD Code to Model and Analyze Unsteady Behavior in a Gaseous Hydrogen Control Valve." NASA/SSC intends to purchase the items from Combustion Research and Flow Technology, Pipersville, PA as the only source which can satisfy the Agency's requirement.	This action represents continued development of new capabilities in the CRUNCH CDF Code under their current SBIR Phase II contract.  A Recommendation and Determination to Solicit From One Source is included in the file.  The Statement of Work is a follows: "Application of Contractor-Developed CRUNCH CFD Code to Model and Analyze Unsteady Behavior in a Gaseous Hydrogen Control Valve" Use the CRUNCH unstructured CFD code to model and analyze unsteady behavior in a GH2 control valve.	Use the results of the analysis to determine the frequency content of the flow downstream of the valve.  Determine the best ways to capture the unsteadiness. Background John C. Stennis Space Center is NASA's Lead Center of Excellence for Rocket Propulsion Testing and Earth Science Applications.  It is very important to the SSC mission to have the in-house capability to model all aspects of propellant delivery systems for propulsion testing.  Among the components that comprise a propellant delivery system are valves.  It is becoming increasingly important that we have the ability to understand the unsteady behavior of all propellant delivery system components. Combustion Research and Flow Technologies, Inc. (CRAFT-Tech) has developed the CRUNCH unstructured CFD code to model compressible, incompressible, and real-fluids flows in both internal flow and external flow environments.  Recently CRAFT-Tech has successfully completed an SBIR Phase I and has an active SBIR Phase II to upgrade CRUNCH to include capabilities of interest to SSC, in particular, enhancing time accurate capabilities for valve modeling.  Preliminary investigations into frequency content in cavitating venturis is being pursued as part of this Phase II.   Further issues involved in accurately capturing latent unsteadiness could be profitably pursued at this time to further add capabilities to CRUNCH to the benefit of SSC. Scope of Work The purpose of this Statement of Work is to apply the CRUNCH CFD code to unsteady operation of a gas valve.  The main product of this work will be a determination of the frequency content of a valve during unsteady operation.  These results will be compared with experimental data where available.  As part of this work, the most accurate way to model the unsteadiness will be determined and reported to SSC to assist SSC in future modeling efforts.  To these ends, the following tasks must be successfully accomplished: 1.	Generate an appropriate grid for a 6-inch y-pattern globe control valve used at SSC. This grid will be 3-D and may or may not incorporate half-plane symmetry, depending on the determined needs. 2.	Model this valve for gaseous hydrogen flow in both steady and unsteady modes and compare the results. 3.	Determine the frequency content of the flow downstream of the unsteady valve and compare results to experimental results if available. 4.	Determine the modeling approach and code input settings that best arrive at unsteady solutions and yield the most accurate solutions.  5.	Report all findings resulting from this work. 6.	If modifications were required to CRUNCH for successful completion of this work, deliver a CRUNCH executable to SSC that contains all modifications necessary for successful modeling of unsteady valve operation. Period of Performance The period of performance shall be the date of this order and continue through ninety (90) days. Deliverable One (1) each, final written CDF report and technical plot file on CD ROM. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on October 19, 2004.   Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<CONTACT>Contracting Officer - Sarah Sobor-Bristow, Senior Contracting Officer, Ph:(708) 786-5139, Fx:null
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO PROCURE A BUNDLED CONTRACT: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) will issue a request for proposal (RFP) for the following item:  Prazosin HCl 1MG Cap, package size 100’s and 1000’s; 2MG Cap, package size 100’s and 1000’s and 5MG Cap, package size 100’s and 250 OR 500’s.  NOTE: Where there is a choice of package size as indicated by the word “OR”, the offeror must submit a price on at least one of the two sizes indicated.  Award will be made on the package size most advantageous to the Government.  The estimated annual usage is 47,044 bottles.  The estimated annual usage does not include DoD, IHS and BoP’s requirements at this time.  Award will result in a National Contract, for mandatory use of Prazosin.  This will be a negotiated solicitation resulting in a contract for 1 year plus (4) one year options. If the offeror is not the manufacturer, a copy of the signed agreement between the vendor and the manufacturer must be submitted with the proposals. The agreement must be for the maximum term of the contract. If this agreement is not provided, the vendor will be considered non-compliant and removed from consideration. Price is the most important factor.   Items will be awarded as an aggregate. Vendor must state the exact name (name that appears on label) by which the drug will be supplied and have a unique NDC number. All products must have at a minimum the NDC number bar coded on each individual unit. Bar Code Validation is the process of insuring the data on a bar code label received from suppliers and vendors meet minimum requirements for font, readability, data integrity, and completeness. All bar codes received from the company must verify at a grade of C or higher Suppliers must provide bar coded product that meets these minimum requirements. Methods should be in place to report bar codes that fail validation requirements. Vendors are required to replace products that do not meet minimum validation requirements. The bar code must be in a linear format and conform to all UCC/EAN standards. This means the bar code can be any linear bar code symbiology, such as UCC/EAN-128, RSS, or UPC (if the UPC contains the NDC).  Since the bar code would be a part of the drugs label issues concerning its quality and verification would be subject to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP's) Additionally, vendors should be encouraged to provide the expiration date and lot number in the bar code. The contractor must ensure delivery of the product to the Prime Vendors no later than 45 days after award. The requirements listed above are for VA, DoD, IHS and BoP.  The contracted product will be automatically substituted at the PPV; all other products will be locked out for VA only. Glass bottles are not acceptable. Tablets/capsules must be compatible with automated dispensing units (Baxter ATC Canisters, OptiFill etc.)  The Government reserves the right to add other package sizes to the contract at a later date when they become available or if offered in a vendor’s proposal. This will not affect the number of tablets/capsules listed in the usage requirements. All bottles of 100 tablets or less must have a child resistant closure.   OFFERS ARE NOT BEING SOLICITED AT THIS TIME.  A formal solicitation or request for quotations will be issued at a later date.  NOTE:  PRODUCT MUST BE MANUFACTURED IN A DESIGNATED COUNTRY, CARRIBBEAN BASIN COUNTRY, OR NAFTA COUNTRY, (UNITED STATES, CANADA AND MEXICO).  A LISTING OF DESIGNATED COUNTRIES AND CARIBBEAN BASIN COUNTRIES MAY BE FOUND IN THE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATIONS (FAR) PART 25.003.  COMMENTS MUST BE RECEIVED NO LATER THAN AUGUST 5, 2004.  For additional information regarding contracting issues please contact Sarah Sobor-Bristow, Senior Contracting Officer at Sarah.Bristow@med.va.gov or (708) 786-4934.

<DESC>NOAA’s Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) requires ATLAS 3rd Generation Sensors, to replace existing instrumentation on PMEL’S NX ATLAS moorings. PMEL desires five configurations, four of which, TM, TPM, TCM and TVM, will require First Article Testing. The new subsurface instrumentation shall be small, self-contained data loggers that sample and store data at pre-determined intervals independent of other sensors or the buoy electronics. The instruments are high-accuracy temperature modules (TM) with non-volatile memory and built-in inductive modem. These modules would also have optional configurations to measure water pressure (TPM) or high-accuracy conductivity (TCM, for the computation of salinity), and a stand-alone inductive modem (SM) with external serial RS-232 interface for in-situ direct cable interconnection with other instrumentation. Additionally a high-accuracy temperature current meter (TVM) with non-volatile memory and built-in inductive modem is desired.  Overall lifecycle cost is a strong consideration, since these instruments will be used in arrays of moorings in remote locations.  The instruments shall be: (1) TM – temperature, inductive modem; (2)TPM – temperature, pressure, inductive modem; (3) TCM – temperature, conductivity, inductive modem; (4)TVM – temperature, current meter, inductive modem (5) SM – External RS-232 serial interface, inductive modem. Communication and interfacing: The instrument should provide reliable, low-cost, low-power, real-time full-duplex ASCII data transmission via an inductive modem compatible with the Seabird Electronics, Inc., DPSK (differential-phase-shift-keyed) protocol, using a single, plastic-coated, mooring cable or insulated wire. The modem and inductive coil are to be integral to the instrument. User-selectable (on pre-deployment) operating modes include:  Polled: On command, the modules takes one or more samples and transmits the data along with a time stamp; Autonomous: The modules sample data at pre-programmed intervals, storing the data in FLASH memory; Combo: Data at pre-programmed intervals is stored in FLASH memory and the SIM can request the last stored data with time stamp; Averaging (Continuous or Burst): Data at pre-programmed intervals is stored in FLASH memory. The SIM can periodically request the average (with time stamp) of the individual data stored since its last request. The period of performance will begin on date of contract award for an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract type and will continue for five years. A Request for Proposal (RFP) solicitation may be available on or about November 16, 2004, through this website.  The approx. closing date may be 30 days after issuance of the RFP.

Additionally, this contract action will include efforts to modify  the C-130 installation design to fit C-130H1 aircraft, as well as contain  options to perform Group A installation on up to 12 C-130 aircraft. The AN/AAQ-24 system is already developed, tested, and proven to meet C-130  protection requirements as spelled out in the Multi-Command Large Aircraft  Infrared Countermeasures Operational Requirements Document 314-92.  Northrop  Grumman has received Configuration Control Board approval to modify C-130  aircraft for LAIRCM installation on C-130H3 and C-130H2 aircraft.  The first C- 130H3 was modified and delivered to AMC in Apr 04 and the first C-130H2 was  delivered to the Reno Air National Guard in Aug 04.  Northrop Grumman is  scheduled to deliver a LAIRCM modified HC-130(H)N to the Alaska Air National  Guard in Aug 05.

The Anti-Icing Valve is pressure-activated solenoid, regulator/shutoff valve that regulates the bleeding of compressed engine air. The Anti-Icing Valve is an electro-pneumatic device.  The valve has two modes; closed and regulating.  When an electrical signal is received from the aircraft, ice sensors or a manual switch in the cockpit, the Anti-Icing Valve switches to the regulating mode, open and regulates the flow of warm air to the engine inlet.  In the regulating mode, the valve modulates as necessary to maintain a given outlet pressure to the front frame of the engine based on the inlet pressure from the bleed air system.  Additionally, when the valve is in the regulating mode, the pressure switch provides an electrical signal to the cockpit to indicate the valve is operating.

<DESC>The Division of Cancer Prevention (DCP) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) is seeking a contractor to provide technical information support resources for cancer preventive agent identification, development, and qualification for clinical trials.  The projects required to satisfy the RFP workscope shall provide the diverse and specialized technical support services and products needed for the preclinical and clinical development of the most promising cancer chemopreventive agents.  The contractor will be responsible for providing services that support the discovery and early development of new agents in chemoprevention through literature searching, class studies, and agent scoring. The preclinical and clinical drug testing is supported through a comprehensive system of documenting all test results and clinical activities related to the agent and agent combination through a computerized database.  The workscope of the RFP is divided into different task areas.  These task areas are fully integrated and cohesive. Offerors are required to respond to all task areas of the RFP as one package.  Comprehensive details of the information management system are expected to be provided by the offeror based on their knowledge of the disciplines required in the Statement of Work, as well as experience working in the multidisciplinary fields of chemoprevention.  However, the information management system must be compatible with and migrate to the existing DCP Enterprise System Knowledge base (DESK) requirements specified in the RFP.  The task areas of the statement of work include:1) Cancer Preventive Agent Identification and Documentation; 2) Cancer Preventive Agent Data and Report Analysis, Status  and Documentation; 3) Information Management System and 4) General Tasks.  The proposed acquisition is a re-competition of contract N02-CN-05008 awarded to CCS Associates, Inc.  Any award resulting from this solicitation will be made on the basis of cascading evaluation preference approach.  It is anticipated that one (1) level of effort, TERM type contract will be awarded and that the period of performance will consist of a base period of five (5) years plus two (2) option years for possible total of seven (7) contract years.  It is also anticipated that there will be options for additional hours for each contract year including option years six and seven.    The award will be made to an eligible business concern included in one of the following three (3) cascading preference tiers, provided that adequate competition is received and award can be made at fair market price (see definition at FAR Part 19).  Adequate competition is defined as the receipt of at least two (2) competitive proposals in a tier from companies that are determined to be qualified, technically acceptable, cost reasonable and responsible business concerns.  The cascading evaluation is to be applied in the following manner: First Tier Competition: This Tier is defined by competition among eligible  HUBZone small business concerns providing 51% or more of the direct labor dollars proposed for the required contract effort.  In the event that adequate competition and fair market price requirements cannot be met under the First Tier Competition, and there is only one technically qualified firm offering a fair market price, then competition at this Tier will stop. The one qualified firm from the First Tier will compete in the Second Tier Competition. Second Tier Competition is defined as competition among eligible small business concerns providing 51% or more of the direct labor dollars proposed for the required contract effort. If adequate competition and fair market price requirements are met under the Second Tier, competition at the Third Tier will not occur and award will be made at the Second Tier. In the event that adequate competition and fair market price requirements cannot be met under the Second Tier Competition, and there is only one technically qualified firm offering a fair market price, then competition at this Tier will stop. The one qualified firm from the Second Tier will compete in the Third Tier Competition. Third Tier Competition is defined as an unrestricted, full and open competition with selection of an awardee based upon a best value determination pursuant to FAR 15.3.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541519.  Request for Proposal (RFP) No. N02-CN-45005-46 will be available electronically on or about March 24, 2004 with a due date for receipt of proposals on or about May 14, 2004.

<DESC>Description: 

1. The Projects: NOAA has a requirement for hydrographic surveying services to support its nautical charting mission. It is contemplated that two or more contracts will be awarded.  Although each contract will have a nationwide scope, vendors are particularly sought with specific capability to satisfy NOAA’s hydrographic survey needs in three distinct geographic areas: (1) the navigable waters of Alaska, including remote areas, bays, and harbors, (2) the Gulf of Mexico, and (3) all other navigable waters of the U.S., including the east coast, Pacific, the Great Lakes and U.S. territories.  Each indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract will have a five year term.  Task orders will be issued against the resulting contracts based on available funding.  The cumulative value of the task orders issued against the resulting contract(s) will not exceed $50 million. 

Task orders under the resulting contracts may consist of but are not limited to: 1) acquiring shallow water multibeam sounding data; 2) acquiring side scan sonar data; 3) acquiring vertical beam echosounder data; 4) determining positions and least depths on hazards to navigation; 5) installing, operating, and removing water level (tide) stations; 6) acquiring related supporting data (e.g. water level correctors, velocity of sound in the water column, vessel motion correctors, bottom sediment samples, etc.); 7) processing the data, including tidal tabulation, computation of tidal datums, tidal zoning determination, applying water level, vessel motion, and velocity of sound correctors to determine the true depths, correlating sonar targets, and compiling reports, final smooth sheets, and digital data; and 8) performing quality control during data acquisition and processing; and 9) the delivery of the data, reports, and sheets to NOAA for archival and application to the nautical charts and associated nautical products.  

All work shall be performed to NOAA specifications and the data provided in NOAA specified formats.  See http://chartmaker.ncd.noaa.gov/hsd/specs/specs.htm for typical technical specifications and a description of the deliverables. The project instructions will tailor these specifications for each task order issued.  A quality control plan will be a contract requirement.  Firms responding are encouraged to review the technical specifications and the description of deliverables before responding to this announcement. 

The resulting contracts will permit a Government COTR or observer to be present during shipboard operations.  If the contractor conducts vessel operations overnight, the contractor will be required to provide meals and accommodations to the Government COTR or observer.  

2. Selection Criteria:  Firms must provide sufficient surveying vessel(s) and equipment and sufficient technical, supervisory, and administrative personnel to ensure expeditious execution of work assignments.  Utilization of small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, HUBZone, veteran-owned, or service disabled veteran-owned small businesses will be one of the evaluation factors in the selection process.  To be considered for selection, a firm must demonstrate surveying experience in the types of surveys stated above and have on payroll at least two hydrographers and a tides/water level specialist. The two hydrographers must each have a minimum of three years experience in hydrographic surveying and demonstrated experience in surveying using shallow water multibeam sonar system, vertical beam echosounder, side scan sonar system and interpreting the data.  The tides/water level specialist must have demonstrated experience in measurement of tides and water levels, tidal datums, and tidal zoning and their application to hydrographic surveying.

Unacceptable:  The submission failed to meet the minimum standards; has a low probability of satisfying the requirements; reflects significant performance risk. 

Subsequent to the initial evaluation, those firms that are considered most highly qualified may be scheduled for interviews.   

Responding firms are required to state whether they are small, small disadvantaged business, women-owned, HUBZone, veteran-owned, or service disabled veteran-owned small business. Responding firms are encouraged to use small business concerns in a meaningful manner in the execution of this project.  Large business firms should demonstrate their commitment and discuss proposed plans to provide subcontracting opportunities to the small business community in the performance of this project.  

Specific abilities and disciplines required include (but are not limited to):  Project Manager, Hydrographer, Tides/Water Level Specialist, Land Surveyor, and GIS Specialist (Geographers/Cartographer/Geospatial Data Analyst).  

Firms should indicate their experience using a shallow water multibeam survey system and an outline of how the Prime contractor will manage their team to ensure that quality products are delivered to NOAA.  

For evaluation factor (3) Capacity, a list of key personnel demonstrating their availability for the project considering other commitments and major equipment available for project assignment must be provided along with other pertinent data.  

3. Submission:  Responsible sources may submit a response for consideration by NOAA.  Prime contractors shall respond to this announcement for their teams.

<DESC>The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) is seeking proposals from business entities interested in participating in an acquisition as a Prime Vendor (PV) to provide items under the general groupings of lumber and related products and woodworking machinery and tools for the Korea and Japan regions.  A PV, or integrated suppliers, can be defined as the designation of a single source of supply for a wide range of products.  The requirements covered under this solicitation include, but are not limited to, Federal Supply Class (FSC) 55: softwood lumber, hardwood lumber, plywood/veneer, poles, pilings, ties, crossarms, dowels, plugs, stakes, doors and moldings and FSC 32: sawmill and planing mill machinery, woodworking machines/tools and attachments for woodworking machinery.  This is a representative list and should not be considered exhaustive of all products that will be required of the acquisition.  The intended solicitation will cover military customers located in Korea and Japan (including Okinawa).  Prospective offerors should have the capability to deliver lumber and related products as well as woodworking machinery and tools within the region.  The intended solicitation will be issued on an unrestricted basis with the resultant contract being an Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC) for two (2) base years and three (3) one-year options.  Estimated value of this acquisition is $6,800,000 for the base period; $17,000,000 for total contract period.  This will be a best value/source selection acquisition in which technical merit is considered more important than price.  Solicitation SP0560-04-R-0071 is anticipated to be issued on 12 April 2004 with an estimated closing date of 12 May 2004.  A Pre-Proposal Conference, to be held at DCMA Portland, is tentatively scheduled for 21 April 2004 and interested parties should request to be notified.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The selected vendo rs will be required to self-certify Buy-America and DOD Unique IDentification (UID) [http://www.acq.osd.mil/uid/] compliance with approved commercial market product marking standards for CMIT. The USA companies are required to comply with FAR and DFAR, Buy -American Act, and USA Export Laws and Regulations. The FMS CMIT ALF Vendor-Pool companies must comply with accounting, documentation, and logistics requirements mandated by USA Laws and DOD Regulations.      FMS CMIT ALF Program solicitations will also require contractors   capable of providing international distribution, and/or logistics and fulfillment of the requisite portion of USA OEM and OSD products. FMS CMIT ALF Contractors will be required to hav e financial capability and experience to support FMS CMIT ALF requirements up to a maximum of $5M.       The Pre-Solicitation Conference will be held to further explain in detail the requirements and rationale for those requirements. As indicated above, the Government is considering various acquisition approaches such as the use of BPAs and/or IDIQ contr acts to meet these often-varied requirements. As part of the Pre-Solicitation conference, the Government hopes that there will be an extensive dialogue with industry as to the best methodology to acquire the necessary FMS CMIT.      PRE-SOLICITATION CONFERENCE for FMS CMIT ALF, Program Consultation: Only those persons in attendance at the FMS CMIT ALF conference, and reading this announcement, will be provided FMS CMIT ALF information. US Government personnel will answer FMS CMIT  ALF content questions only on the day of the conference.

<CONTACT>MAGDA SZYMANSKI, Contract Specialist, (973)724-3066
<DESC>The U.S. Army TACOM-Picatinny intends to award a sole source contract for the manufacture of approximately 200 projectiles and engineering services in support of the Joint Ballistic Memorandum of Understand (JBMoU) Compliance Testing of 155 BONUS Projectile.  Projectile hardware of various configurations will allow a thorough assessment of:  safety, ballistic solution (firing tables), Explosive Ordnance Disposal, and training resources (models, etc.) In addition, engineering services will facilitate witness testing, test planning and evaluation of test results, and support for the Army Material Release activities.  This assessment and evaluation will determine whether the U.S. Army 155mm Howitzer Systems can fire the 155 BONUS.  The end result would be a “Release for Use” of the Projectile to U.S. Army Field Artillery Units, allowing ammunition sharing during coalition operations.  No projectiles will be part of the U.S. Army inventory as a result of this effort.  The contract will be awarded on a sole source basis to United Defense (UDLP), 4800 East River Drive, Minneapolis, MN 55421 under the authority of FAR  6.302-1, avoidance of duplication of cost and unacceptable delays in  fulfilling the agency’s requirements.  GIAT Industries and Bofors Defence are subcontractors for this effort.  See notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>Air Force Research Laboratory, AFRL/MLOB is contemplating a program entitled, “Next Generation Airfield Matting.”  The goal of this program is to develop a lightweight, low-cost metal matting system to replace AM-2 matting. The product must meet the requirements specified in the Rapid Parking Ramp Expansion (RPRE) Capabilities Development Document (CDD). Chief among these requirements is the need support the rolling load of an F-15E on soil with a CBR of 6 with a system areal density of 3 lbs/sqft and a cost goal of $18/sqft. The tradeoff between system performance and cost has not been determined, but a cost analysis will be required. The contractor will use all possible manufacturing options to achieve cost, including, but not limited to, sand casting and extrusion. When possible, the contractor will minimize manufacturing steps and touch time by pursuing activities that include, but are not limited to, integrated face sheets and integrated latching mechanisms. Interested offerors may view and/or download the full PRDA/BAA solicitation when it is posted by accessing the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) homepage at http://www.fbo.gov/. Direct questions to the Contracting point of contact identified in the announcement.

Website Submission: http://www.sainc.com/dso0412/. The Defense Sciences Office is seeking innovative and aggressive proposals to better understand and affect the mechanisms of tissue healing following damage. The vision for the Restorative Injury Repair (RIR) Program is to fully restore functionality of complex tissue after damage or loss due to traumatic injury in the battlefield. These injuries include both kinetic (i.e., fragmentation and penetration wounds) as well as other destructive injuries (chemical and thermal burns, musculoskeletal injuries, etc.). This vision for RIR contrasts sharply with current biological reactions to injury, which are dominated by fibrosis (scarring) and reduced or lost performance. DARPA sees restoration of structure and function as critical needs. The program seeks to extend tissue injury research beyond “single factor” therapies and develop a comprehensive approach addressing, but not limited to, an understanding of the overall systemic response at all levels to tissue wounding; damage and healing; the complexity of the wound environment; cellular involvement; exploitation of scaffolds/extracellular matrices; the importance of nutrition, energy balance, and substrate utilization; the role of inflammatory and immune pathways; and morphogenesis leading to full functional restoration. This will be an extremely aggressive, milestone-driven program, with a 24-month Phase 1 effort focused on defining the wound environment and generating a blastema in a non-regenerating animal.  This will be followed by a 24-month Phase 2 effort, culminating in the restoration of a functional multi-tissue type structure in a non-regenerating animal. Phase 1 will be divided into two, 12-month periods, with a specific 12-month milestone that must be reached in order to progress to the second year. To accomplish this Phase 1 effort, it is expected that interdisciplinary teams will be required to first define the critical factors (e.g., cellular debris, microflora, inflammatory mediators, cellular energy budgets, artificial scaffolds) proximate to the wound site and systemic that decrease fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis by 20 percent and establish a population of blastema-like cells (defined by at least three characteristic markers) at the wound site. These pluripotent cells may arise from local stem cells, migrating stem cells, or dedifferentiation. Demonstration of these objectives will lead to controlled blastema formation at sites of tissue damage or loss in animals where regeneration is atypical. Approaches should rapidly lead to the development of new therapies or interventions that re-establish the developmental program that persists through morphogenic commitment. Specific technical challenges may include: 1) assessing the contribution of microflora, inflammatory mediators, clotting factors, apoptosis, necrosis, basement membranes/extracellular matrix, rapid epithelialization, etc., to the early events in wound closure and healing; 2) comparing and contrasting scarring vs. regenerative healing at the molecular level; 3) exploring age-related differences in regenerative ability; 4) defining possible checkpoints driven by cellular energy budgets and material availability; 5) testing the ability of exogenous scaffolds to improve the quality, quantity, and speed of healing; 6) establishing the mechanism of cellular transdifferentiation in the wound environment; 7) controlled recruitment of pluripotent cells; 8) determining the contribution of proteolytic remodeling of the near- and mid-term wound site to healing; 9) quantifying the extracellular and intracellular chemical gradients that regulate appropriate gene expression; and 10) understanding the causal relationships between cells and their environment that lead to stable blastema formation. Mathematic and computer modeling should be included when appropriate. Investigator teams should include a skill set capable of addressing the described technical challenges leading to Phase 1 milestones in a single integrated proposal. Consideration will be given to proposals that consider one or more of these challenges in the absence of an integrated team, provided they are willing to be integrated with others who have accepted the challenge of meeting the specific milestone. Phase 2 proposals will be requested at a later date. TEAMING: Progress in the RIR program will depend on the formation of well-managed interdisciplinary efforts that draw on expertise from such areas as regeneration, developmental biology, pattern formation, wound healing, tissue engineering, bioinformatics, systems biology, functional genomics, cell biology and reprogramming, stem cell biology, cellular trafficking, immunology, and inflammation. Members of interdisciplinary teams with established records will be required to work collaboratively and collectively maintain sharp focus toward achieving the Phase 1 objectives. SUBMISSION OF WHITE PAPERS: We invite white papers (10 pages or less) in response to this announcement. The white paper should be organized as follows: 1) An Executive Summary. 2) The idea. Which area(s) of emphasis are you addressing? 3) The approach. How will you address these areas? Briefly define the research plan you intend to follow. What are the research challenges, and how will they be addressed? What is unique or revolutionary about your approach? What additional capabilities do you envision will be enabled by your ideas? How do you plan to demonstrate the success of the research effort within the 12-month period of funding, and the following 12 months, as appropriate? Every white paper must describe specific, quantitative milestone(s) that need to be achieved in order to demonstrate progress in reaching the ultimate goals of the program. 4) The cost. What is your cost estimate for resources required for the proposed time line? 5) The Management Plan. A brief description of the technical expertise of the principal investigator and the key team members must be provided, along with a management plan describing how different disciplines represented on the team will be integrated to ultimately generate a proof-of-concept to be completed within the 12- and 24-month windows. Proposers should attempt to address the breadth of the research problem as described with imbedded metrics for achieving both Phase 1 goals. An aggressive and timely solution to the problem should emerge through each step of Phase 1 and into Phase 2. White papers sent in response to this addendum are due at DARPA no later than 1600 hours EST November 19, 2004. Proposers submitting white papers will be notified within 15 business days of that date if a full proposal will be requested. To facilitate the submission process, a website has been established, http://www.sainc.com/dso0412/. Not withstanding the disposition of white papers, DARPA will accept full proposals for this addendum. PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS: Each proposal should: 1) explicitly address tests, demonstrations, and other research activities planned in the area(s) of interest described above; 2) include at least two specific and quantitative scientific and/or technical objectives for each scientific/technical area of interest addressed in the proposal that clearly demonstrate the research is on track for meeting the ultimate program goal; 3) include clearly delineated intellectual property arrangements and transition paths; and 4) include identification and assessment of critical scientific and/or technical barriers to the program objective and plausible approaches to develop solutions or overcome their limiting effects. Upon award, specific deliverables and appropriate level demonstrations of the science and/or technology elements will be required periodically, and a final demonstration of the deliverable system is required at the end of the program. Given the breadth of the areas of interest, it is anticipated that only comprehensive and fully integrated team efforts addressing the entire challenge problems will be funded; therefore, bidder teaming is highly encouraged. Proposed Phase 1 efforts should not exceed 24 months. If proposals include use of Government facilities, offerors will be expected to conclude commercial services arrangements with the providing Government facility. If multiple awards are made, down-selection may occur annually based on technical progress and achievements. Proposals with cost share should clearly identify the specific tasks to be cost shared in the technical proposal and separately break out the corresponding costs in the cost proposal. The number of awards will be dependent on the suitability of proposals received and availability of funds. Full proposals shall consist of two volumes: technical and cost. The technical and cost volumes shall conform to the guidelines in DARPA (DSO) BAA 04-12 of February 2, 2004. To receive consideration under this addendum, PROPOSALS ARE DUE AT DARPA NO LATER THAN 1600 EST January 21, 2005, at the address shown below. Proposals received after that date, will be considered under the Open BAA only. A website http://www.sainc.com/dso0412/ has been established to facilitate the submission of full proposals electronically.

<DESC>The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) at Los Angeles Air Force Base (LAAFB) plans to vacate existing office space (total 835,000 square feet) located on the southeast and northwest corners of the intersection of El Segundo Blvd. and Aviation Blvd. (Areas A and B) in El Segundo, Ca and move into new facilities (aprox. total 706,350 sq ft) currently under construction on the northwest property (Area B) The new facilities will consist of three multi-story office buildings. Starting as early as May 2005, the Air Force (AF) will be relocating approximately 2,900 people. All personnel relocation will take place within a five- mile radius of 2400 East El Segundo Blvd. in El Segundo, Ca. The first relocation will involve approximately 600 people moving from five buildings into a new 146,352 square feet office building called the Consolidated Base Support Complex (CBSC). The second relocation will involve moving approximately 2,300 people from seven, two-story buildings and one, six-story office building into two-new buildings comprising 560,000 square feet called the Systems Acquisition Management Support (SAMS) complex. The furniture, both systems and stand-alone types, left in all of the vacated buildings will be made available to other government organizations to remove and use at their facilities - other government organizations will have 10 days once a building is vacated to remove furniture. After the other government organizations have removed the furniture they want to use, the remaining furniture will need to be removed and moved to the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service (DRMS), 779 Stethem Road Building 513, Port Hueneme, CA 93043.  The Contractor shall dispose of furniture that DRMS cannot accept. Both the CBSC and SAMS buildings will be made available for the Contractor to install furniture and move people in phases. The Contractor shall adjust their schedules for manufacturing, installation etc. as many times as necessary to reflect all critical paths in the redevelopment construction schedules. This risk should be priced into the proposal.  The Air Force will not be liable for any damages due to the construction schedule changes. Once the Air Force takes beneficial occupancy/final acceptance of CBSC, the Contractor has 60 calendar days from date of written Air Force Contracting Officer notification to completely move organizations into CBSC, and 90 calendar days from date of written notice to completely move organizations into the SAMS buildings. A complete move is defined as installing all of the furniture ordered under this contract for each building, providing any ancillary services as described in this SOW, and removal and disposal of all excess furniture from the vacated buildings.

<DESC>The following change is hereby issued:  The Design-Build project will have a two year project duration, not twelve (12) months as indicated in the notice that was posted on 09 September 2004.  Note that responses from individuals must be received no later than 2:00 p.m. CST on 12 October 2004. *** 

Construction Management (CM) Services are required for the proposed Curtainwall Design and Repair of E.M. Dirksen and J.C. Kluczynski Federal Building in Chicago, Illinois.  The scope of CM Services under this proposed contract is for Construction Phase Services.  

Project Summary.  The project proposes repairs to the original curtainwall system, replacement of deteriorated glass-to-metal and metal-to-metal building joint seals, repair or replacement of damaged curtainwall components, installation of a proper weep system to drain water from the curtainwall system, painting of both buildings in their entirety, modifications to the glass lites to improve blast resistance, and establishment of a consistent overall building appearance in strict compliance with original building design aesthetics.  This will be a Design-Build project with an estimated total construction cost range of $18,000,000 to $22,000,000 and project duration of approximately 12 months.

Definition of Construction Manager.  A Construction Manager is responsible for providing the management, quality control and administrative tasks needed to perform the services in expeditious and economical manner consistent with the best interests of the Government.  A Construction Manager’s duties shall include, but are not limited to the following tasks: conducting a pre-bid conference for potential design/builders, preparing addendums and answering questions on RFP from potential design/builders, coordinating design activities, monitoring the design progress, reviewing and evaluating contractor’s schedules and phasing plan, scheduling and attending all progress meetings, tracking and facilitating timely security clearances, reviewing cost estimates and payment applications, preparing independent government estimates, resolving problems with the design/ build firm, keeping government records, reporting on job progress, monitoring and reporting on quality of design/development, assisting in negotiations of change orders, monitoring and reporting on cost vs. budget, and coordinating information between A/E, Contractors and GSA.  

Proposal Submission Requirements.  Proposals will be evaluated on a two-stage, qualification based selection process.  Firms with an interest in being considered for the project will be required to submit information for the following factors:

1) Past Experience/ Performance (35%)- This factor considers the offeror’s experience as a firm in providing comparable construction management services for similar projects.  The offeror shall submit at least three (3) similar renovation projects of occupied office space that were completed in the last five (5) years with a construction cost greater than $8,000,000.  For each project, provide information as to compliance with contract schedule, budget and quality requirements; the number and severity of problems; effectiveness of corrective actions taken and overall work record.  Past Experience can be described as what jobs you have performed.  

2) Qualification of Key Personnel (35%)- This factor evaluates the experience and qualifications of team members and their availability and responsibility to the proposed project.  The Offeror shall provide evidence of the competency, past performance and related experience for team members to be assigned to this project.  Team Members, at a minimum, include the Project Manager and On-Site Superintendent.  Resumes for each team member should address:  currently held position/title, proposed project position/title, education, professional licensing, personal awards received and work experience over the past ten (10) years.  Summarize the qualifications, experience, education, background information, specific assignments and other significant information for each proposed key member of the offeror’s team.  Provide a preliminary staffing plan that identifies the proposed duties of the key personnel.  Provide at least two references for each team member.  The government intends to contact those individuals and firms that are listed as references by the offeror, as well as others that may be obtained in the process, to verify that services provided were on projects similar to this solicitation, and to solicit their assessments of the quality of those services that were provided.   
    
3) Management Plan (30%)- The factor considers the offeror’s management plan which indicates the means and methods to ensure the project is managed in a manner which will maximize the opportunity for successful completion of the project on-time, on-budget and within quality expectations.  The Offeror shall provide a detailed Project Management Plan in narrative form describing project staffing, coordination, communication, project scheduling and quality control methods.   Provide a Staffing Plan which details the amount of time anticipated to be spent on-site for each key person and the amount of time to be spent working in the home office on this project.  

In Stage I, the Evaluation Board shall evaluate the qualifications and performance record of the CM submittals and shall select the most highly qualified firms and invite them to participate in Stage II of the selection process.  In Stage II the short-listed CM firms will be required to submit additional information, including past performance information and Standard Form 330, and participate in an oral presentation.  Stage II interviews will be held in Chicago on November 08 & 09, 2004.  The Government will solicit a price proposal from the selected Construction Manager.

<DESC>NEW LOCATION FOR INDUSTRY DAY MEETING:

Association Of The United States Army (AUSA)Building
2425 Wilson Boulevard
Arlington, Virginia 22201


The Federal Acquisition Institute (FAI) intends to hold an Industry Day for interested vendors to provide information related to FAI’s initiatives and activities under the Acquisition Workforce Training Fund (AWTF).  FAI will describe our plans and requirements for training related services. 

FAI works in partnership with the Defense Acquisition University (DAU). DAU  provides mandatory, assignment-specific, and continuing education courses for military and civilian acquisition personnel within the Department of Defense. As part of Industry Day, DAU will present information on recent contracting curriculum changes.

WHO SHOULD ATTEND?  Training developers, vendors with Commercial-Off-The- Shelf (COTS) training products, vendors with capabilities related to the full instructional system design (ISD) methodologies, and acquisition experts.

FAI’s mission is to foster and promote the development of a professional acquisition workforce into effective business leaders.  Section 1412 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 (H.R. 1588) authorized an Acquisition Workforce Training Fund (AWTF) “to ensure that the Federal acquisition workforce adapts to fundamental changes in the nature of Federal Government acquisition of property and services associated with the changing roles of the Federal Government; and acquires new skills and a new perspective to enable it to contribute effectively in the changing environment of the 21st century.”  FAI will use the fund to develop training resources needed to enable federal acquisition professionals to transition to a service oriented and technology driven federal market.

FAI coordinates with the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP), the FAI Board of Directors and the Chief Acquisition Officers (CAO) Council, and DAU to identify training needs and set priorities for use of the fund. OFPP provides guidance on Administration initiatives and new issues in acquisition. 

The Industry Day will be held on October 13, 2004 from 10:00 am to 12:00 noon, at the Association Of The United States Army (AUSA)Building located at 2425 Wilson Boulevard, Arlington, Virginia 22201

The preclinical and clinical drug testing is supported through a comprehensive system of documenting all test results and clinical activities related to the agent and agent combination through a computerized database.  The workscope of the RFP is divided into different task areas.  These task areas are fully integrated and cohesive. Offerors are required to respond to all task areas of the RFP as one package.  Comprehensive details of the information management system are expected to be provided by the offeror based on their knowledge of the disciplines required in the Statement of Work, as well as experience working in the multidisciplinary fields of chemoprevention.  However, the information management system must be compatible with and migrate to the existing DCP Enterprise System Knowledge base (DESK) requirements specified in the RFP.  The task areas of the statement of work include:1) Cancer Preventive Agent Identification and Documentation; 2) Cancer Preventive Agent Data and Report Analysis, Status  and Documentation; 3) Information Management System and 4) General Tasks.  The proposed acquisition is a re-competition of contract N02-CN-05008 awarded to CCS Associates, Inc.  Any award resulting from this solicitation will be made on the basis of cascading evaluation preference approach.  It is anticipated that one (1) level of effort, TERM type contract will be awarded and that the period of performance will consist of a base period of five (5) years plus two (2) option years for possible total of seven (7) contract years.  It is also anticipated that there will be options for additional hours for each contract year including option years six and seven.    The award will be made to an eligible business concern included in one of the following three (3) cascading preference tiers, provided that adequate competition is received and award can be made at fair market price (see definition at FAR Part 19).  Adequate competition is defined as the receipt of at least two (2) competitive proposals in a tier from companies that are determined to be qualified, technically acceptable, cost reasonable and responsible business concerns.  The cascading evaluation is to be applied in the following manner: First Tier Competition: This Tier is defined by competition among eligible  HUBZone small business concerns providing 51% or more of the direct labor dollars proposed for the required contract effort.  In the event that adequate competition and fair market price requirements cannot be met under the First Tier Competition, and there is only one technically qualified firm offering a fair market price, then competition at this Tier will stop. The one qualified firm from the First Tier will compete in the Second Tier Competition. Second Tier Competition is defined as competition among eligible small business concerns providing 51% or more of the direct labor dollars proposed for the required contract effort. If adequate competition and fair market price requirements are met under the Second Tier, competition at the Third Tier will not occur and award will be made at the Second Tier. In the event that adequate competition and fair market price requirements cannot be met under the Second Tier Competition, and there is only one technically qualified firm offering a fair market price, then competition at this Tier will stop. The one qualified firm from the Second Tier will compete in the Third Tier Competition. Third Tier Competition is defined as an unrestricted, full and open competition with selection of an awardee based upon a best value determination pursuant to FAR 15.3.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541519.  Request for Proposal (RFP) No. N02-CN-45005-46 will be available electronically on or about March 24, 2004 with a due date for receipt of proposals on or about May 14, 2004.

The RFQ states that the purpose of the Purchase Order is, in part, to investigate the potential implications of industrial ecology and genomics on the future of radiation protection "through two speaker/forum events."  It then notes that two additional speaker/forum events "will be held" but does not state when these two additional events will be held or whether they are to be conducted by the Contractor during the term of the contract.

The RFQ  notes that the RPD Innovation Team's past investigations have included "seminars open to a broad range of participants from public as well as private sectors, joint efforts with academic and non-profit institutions and the application of industrial ecology principles, and visits to organizations  outside the DC area to interview leading experts in the topics being explored."  Please provide web links to the seminar proceedings and any other relevant information resulting from these past investigations.  If such material is not available, please indicate the time period over which such past  seminars have been held and any other available information about the seminars and other activities. (A2.)

<DESC>The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) is seeking proposals from business entities interested in participating in an acquisition as a Prime Vendor (PV) to provide items under the general groupings of lumber and related products and woodworking machinery and tools for the Korea and Japan regions.  A PV, or integrated suppliers, can be defined as the designation of a single source of supply for a wide range of products.  The requirements covered under this solicitation include, but are not limited to, Federal Supply Class (FSC) 55: softwood lumber, hardwood lumber, plywood/veneer, poles, pilings, ties, crossarms, dowels, plugs, stakes, doors and moldings and FSC 32: sawmill and planing mill machinery, woodworking machines/tools and attachments for woodworking machinery.

The intended solicitation will be issued on an unrestricted basis with the resultant contract being an Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC) for two (2) base years and three (3) one-year options.  Estimated value of this acquisition is $6,800,000 for the base period; $17,000,000 for total contract period.  This will be a best value/source selection acquisition in which technical merit is considered more important than price.  Solicitation SP0560-04-R-0071 is anticipated to be issued on 12 April 2004 with an estimated closing date of 12 May 2004.

<DESC>Explosive Detection System

he Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory has developed the INEEL Explosive Detection System which is a non-intrusive, noncontact inspection technique that can, in 300 seconds, identify explosives hidden in a small cargo truck of similar vehicle.

The system uses neutron technology in a portal-type configuration.  The trucks or automobiles entering a government building parking garage, military base or embassy grounds, would be required to stop within the system's inspection zone.  After the driver exits the vehicle, the INEEL process would begin.

Using a technique called a Pulsed Thermal Neutron Analysis, the system uses high-energy neutron output to cause nuclear excitation of materials within the vehicle.  The INEEL patent-pending system uses detectors to identify elements with the targeted cargo that indicate the presence of explosives.  

The INEEL system is quick, inexpensive and reliable, due in part to its simple, yet robust design that incorporates few moving parts that can break down.  The system also monitors the health of its individual components, which allows the operator to quickly pinpoint potential problems and make adjustments

<DESC>Argonne National Laboratory is looking for companies interested in participating in the construction of 40 undulators for the Linac Coherent Light Source (http://www-ssrl.slac.stanford.edu/lcls/).

The Linac Coherent Light Source will be the world's first x-ray free electron laser (FEL) when it becomes operational in 2009.  This is a United States â€“Department of Energy -funded project that is currently in the detailed project engineering and design phase.  Design and construction are accomplished by a partnership of three Department of Energy national laboratories including the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center as home laboratory, together with the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Argonne National Laboratory.  The start of construction is planned in FY2005.

In a FEL, the actual lasing occurs as a result of the electron beam passing through a precision magnetic device called an undulator. Undulator construction is the responsibility of Argonne National Laboratory.

The purpose of this notice is to identify and pre-qualify vendors, interested in supplying 19,200 precision machined and annealed Vanadium Permendur magnet poles, approximately 44 mm wide, 48 mm high and 6 mm thick.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, is seeking qualified sources that can provide improved, digitally operated 2.75-Inch Rocket launchers for use by U.S. Navy, Marine Corps and Army attack and special operations aircraft. The launchers will support all interface requirements of the current 2.75-inch guided and unguided family of rockets, and will replace the Navy’s LAU 61/68 rocket launchers and the Army’s M260 and M261 rocket launchers.  Interface requirements for the launchers include compliance with the MIL-STD-1760D Aircraft/Store Electrical Interconnection System (as a carriage store without a Carriage Store Station Interface), the two 23 and 26 pin connectors of the Rocket Management System (RMS), and a backward-compatible 5-pin analog interface through which 28 VDC firing pulses are sent to the launcher to fire rockets in a sequential order.  These launchers must be compatible with current 14-inch weapon suspension and release systems, have compatibility with current and future 2.75-inch rocket types (guided and unguided), and must provide the ability to set current Remote Settable Fuzed Rockets.  The launcher will include a safety switch that disables all firing circuit functions.  The launchers must be capable of upgrades to complement future guided rocket product improvements that may use MILSTD1553 or other digital communications from the launcher to the warhead/guidance systems.  The launchers must comply with the functional, physical, electrical, and messaging interfaces defined in the interface control document (ICD) that is available upon request.  The launchers must provide the launch platform with launcher built-in-test capability/status, individual tube functional status/rocket inventory, and the ability to fire rockets in individually selected tubes. The launcher will support uploading of software revisions to the launcher electronic assembly (LEA) through its MILSTD1760 connector. The launchers must be capable of detecting whether rockets are being ripple or single fired as well as keeping track of the total number of rockets fired over the life of the launcher.  The launcher must be loadable with rocket inventory data using currently available support equipment, as well as directly from the cockpit.   The rocket inventory must be capable of being uploaded to platforms from the launcher.  Electronic systems interfaces must be compatible with CMBRE test equipment. The U.S. Navy/Marine Corps has available an LEA for integration into the launcher that meets the ICD requirements.  The size, weight, and physical configuration of this LEA are available upon request.  

The launchers must be capable of 430 hours of aircraft carriage, with any number of tubes loaded. Each launcher must survive a minimum of 25 firings per tube (50 firings per tube desired) and survive 10 ripple firings.  The launchers must be capable of surviving off-aircraft handling and storage with any number of tubes loaded.  The launchers will provide increased mean-time-between-failure over existing 2.75 rocket launchers.  It is desired that the launchers be repairable at the Army Aviation Intermediate Maintenance (AVIM) level. The launchers must improve the Insensitive Munitions performance of the rocket/launcher system, to include improved bullet and fragment impact and fast and slow cook-off protection. It is necessary to be able to harmonize the launcher’s aimpoint with the launch platform boresight.  The launchers must be tube loadable when mounted on aircraft.   The launchers must provide a significant weight reduction below currently deployed U.S. Navy/Marine Corps launchers on a per tube basis.  Current U.S. Navy/Marine Corp launchers contain 7 or 19 launch tubes and weigh 84 lbs and 155 lbs respectively.  Launcher weights less than the U.S. Army 2.75-inch 7 and 19 tube Rocket Launchers, which weigh  35 lbs and 85 lbs respectively, are desirable.  The launchers are not restricted to 7 and 19 tubes, but should provide a similar large/small load capability.  The launchers must be capable of operation on AH-1W/Z, UH-1N/Y, and H-60 Series Navy/Marine Corps rotary wing aircraft, and the AH-64A, AH-64D, OH-58D, MH-60 Direct Action Penetrator (DAP) and AH-6 Mission Enhanced Little Bird (MELB).   It is desired that the launcher be capable of operation on F/A-18C/D/E/F, AV-8B, and JSF fixed wing aircraft.  Operation on unmanned air vehicles such as the Fire Scout and the Predator is also desired.  A growth capability will be provided for carriage of a variant of the launcher on M299 HELLFIRE missile launch rails, and will provide for interface through the HELLFIRE Missile shotgun connector using a signal set similar to that specified in MIL-STD 1760A.

  
All parties that currently have or will have the capability to provide the above-described launcher should submit the following information: technical material pertaining to your company's current or future capability to supply the specified launcher, past sales and performance information for both Government and Commercial sales; and any other additional information that could be useful in determining your company's ability to meet the requirements.   Information should be submitted no later than 15 September 2004 to the following address: NAVAIRSYSCOMHQ, Contracts AIR-2.4.4.4.2, Attn: Michelle Plank, 47123 Buse Road, Building 2272, Suite 256, Patuxent River, MD  20670 or via email to michelle.plank@navy.mil.   Any party desiring to provide a briefing on their information submission should contact Michelle Plank at the above address.  THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  It is a market research tool being used to determine the availability and adequacy of potential business sources prior to determining the method of acquisition and issuance of a Request for Proposal including the use of any appropriate small business programs.

<DESC>This preliminary information is being made available for planning purposes only, subject to FAR Clause 52.215-3, entitled “Solicitation for Information and Planning Purposes.”  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal, Invitation for Bid, or Request for Quotation, and it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract.  This procurement is subject to review or cancellation at any time. The Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) is the first mission under the Living With a Star program as part of the Sun-Earth Connection.  SDO will be made up of several instruments seeking to characterize the dynamic state of the Sun, thus enhancing NASA’s understanding of the solar process and space weather.  SDO is viewed as a follow-on to the successful Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) mission.  It will be a three-axis stabilized satellite in a circular geosynchronous orbit of ~105 degrees longitude and having an inclination of 28.5 degrees.  SDO will have a mission life of 5 years, and currently, is scheduled for launch in April 2008. NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) is soliciting comments on requirements established regarding the SDO Lithium-Ion Battery.  The present requirements are specified in the attached documents: Exhibit 1 – Statement of Work (SOW) for Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Project Battery (464-PWR-LEGL-0035), Exhibit 2 – Performance Specification Battery Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) (464-PWR-SPEC-0079), and Exhibit 3 - SDO Project Battery Deliverable Items List and Schedule (DILS). This notice is issued by the NASA GSFC to post a draft SOW, Specification, and DILS via the Internet, and to solicit input and recommendations from interested parties.  The objective of this RFI is to gather information that promotes competition and increases procurement efficiency by improving NASA GSFC’s knowledge of industry’s capabilities.  NASA GSFC invites potential offerors to submit information that may be used to determine eligibility to be participants in feedback sessions with the SDO project.  This procedure is described in FAR Part 15.202.  The intent of the sessions is to provide dialogue in which participants can provide feedback on NASA GSFC requirements, Deliverable Items and Schedule, and its acquisition approach.  The compilation of submitted information may be factored along with SDO requirements to refine the aforementioned SOW (Exhibit 1), Specification (Exhibit 2), and DILS (Exhibit 3). Potential offerors are requested to submit information in the form of a brief Capabilities and Qualifications Statement that includes: 1) Capability to comply with the present requirements outlined in the Performance Specification and SOW.  Requirements that are not in compliance should be noted with brief comment that either describe how a potential offeror’s battery could be brought into compliance or state the potential offeror’s position on such requirement.  This would serve as a main topic in one-on-one feedback sessions.  It should also be stated as to whether certain requirements are cost drivers or increase risk and as to whether or not a fixed-price contract would be acceptable.  2) Capability to meet the hardware deliverable items and schedule, and 3) Summary of past relevant experience in developing Lithium-Ion batteries.  Please advise if this requirement is considered to be a commercial or commercial-type product.  A commercial item is defined in Internet “Note A”. The Government reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto. This notice constitutes all information concerning the SDO Lithium-Ion Battery that will be furnished at this time.  Interested firms are requested to submit their capability statements to Ms. Lorrie Eakin, by email at Lorrie.L.Eakin@nasa.gov no later than the response date indicated above.	Documents, comments, and questions may be forwarded to Ms. Eakin via electronic transmission or by facsimile transmission.

This presolicitation synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, or will the Government pay for the information submitted in response.  Respondents will not be notified of the final results from the one-on-one discussions.  An ombudsman has been appointed—See NASA Specific Note “B”.  The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will be in Microsoft Office 2000 format and will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA GSFC Business Opportunities home page is   http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=C&pin=51.

<SUBJECT>F -- Fall Viewing of Proposed Projects
<DESC>FALL VIEWING OF PROPOSED PROJECTS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2005

Due to anticipated snow conditions at the time of issue for these proposed service and construction contracts, this Fall (2004), may be the only time that bidders/offerors will have the opportunity to see the project sites.  There will be no scheduled showing trips nor will Forest Service employees accompany prospective bidders to the project sites.  However, bidders/offerors are reminded that it is their responsibility to determine for themselves the actual site conditions.  Only by physical inspection on-the-ground viewing can bidders/offerors assure themselves of the existing conditions.  Maps will be available at the Paulina District Office for the Service Contract.  

No snowplowing will occur to provide access to the proposed sites.  Due to the uncertainty of snowfall, it is recommended that project sites be viewed as early as possible in October.

The following is a listing of prospective projects for Fiscal Year 2005:

**Paulina Ranger District, Service Project consisting of Precommercial Thinning Handpiling.  Approximate Size 1350 Acres; Date Area Normally Closed is October 31, 2004; Name and Phone Number of Contact person is Renee Roufs, 541/477-6921.
	
		

**  Paulina Precommercial Thinning and Handpiling: From September 9th to November 28th, the Paulina Ranger District is under a road closure program that restricts motorized travel to roads posted with a green dot.  Permits will be made available to prospective bidders to access closed roads during the closure period.  Prospective bidders are encouraged to call Renee Roufs (541-477-6921) prior to stopping at the Paulina Ranger District Office to make arrangements for a permit.  A map of proposed units will be available when the permit is issued.  In a typical Fall, snow would restrict travel in the Deep thinning units by October 31st.

               Performance Work Statement
1.0.  INTRODUCTION.  This requirement defines tasks for obtaining parts and services needed for the overhaul of the Pump Module Assemblies and associated component parts that are utilized on the Coast Guard fleet of HH-60J aircraft.  Funding for this contract will be provided from annual operating guide 41.00, Funds for Aircraft Maintenance.

2.0.  SCOPE OF WORK.  On an “as required basis”, the contractor shall provide all necessary parts, material, labor, tooling, test equipment and facilities to evaluate and overhaul systems and subsystems of the HH-60J helicopter Pump Module Assemblies, as necessary to conform with the requirements of this Performance Work Statement (PWS), at the firm fixed prices specified in Section B.  
This PWS establishes the minimum requirements necessary to overhaul the Pump Module Assemblies.  Required overhaul is to be accomplished in accordance with the manufacturer’s specifications.  Parker-Hannifin Inc. is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM).  The contractors shall provide their own manuals as the Coast Guard does not own nor can it provide this data.
In order to perform necessary overhaul to components listed in Schedule B, the contractor must have access to the parts and data furnished directly by the OEM.  Proposals shall include evidence of the foregoing access.  Piece parts shall be new parts manufactured or approved by the OEM.  Data includes complete overhaul manuals and service bulletins of the latest revisions required to perform necessary overhaul to components listed in Schedule B.

3.0.  APPLICABLE SPECIFICATIONS.  The following technical and operational directives are applicable to this requirement but are not deliverable under this contract.  Except where otherwise noted, the latest revision in effect as of contract award date applies. The information contained in this section is not intended to be all-inclusive nor to detract from or modify procedures outlined in the manufacturers drawings, specifications and service bulletins, except where specifically noted herein. 

3.1. MANUFACTURERS DRAWING AND SPECIFICATIONS:  The contractor shall have access to the latest required maintenance, overhaul manuals, and Original Equipment Manufacturer's Drawings, Specifications and Service Bulletins to ensure that equipment is overhauled, calibrated and operating in accordance with latest manufacturer's performance/test/acceptance specification criteria.  Drawings and specifications are proprietary and are not available from the Coast Guard.  Coast Guard does not possess nor can it supply the aforementioned.  The offeror will be responsible for obtaining all data.

3.2.  SERVICE BULLETINS:  The contractor shall be required to incorporate service bulletins issued prior to the date of contract if not previously accomplished.  The service bulletins will fall under overhaul to be accomplished in accordance with Original Equipment Manufacturer's latest commercial build standard and shall be included in the proposed overhaul price.
  
New service bulletins created and incorporated during performance of this contract may create new part number configurations, i.e., Class II changes, which will not change form, fit or function, will be replaced on an attrition basis unless directed by an Airworthiness Directive.  In cases where the old configuration cannot be modified to the new, the new part number may be added to the overhaul contract.  If applicable, contractor will provide within the 30-day period a flat rate overhaul price for the new part number to cover the remaining option years.  Superseded parts, which have been removed, and replaced by new part number configurations are to be scrapped at contractor's facility in the presence of a DCMAO inspector or Coast Guard designated COTR.

4.0.  DEFINITIONS.  For the purpose of this contract, the following definitions apply:

4.1.  OVERHAUL:  To restore to original equipment manufacturer's (OEM) minimum functional performance specifications by disassembling, inspection, overhaul, assembly and testing of parts or components in accordance with OEM's current specifications and procedures.

4.2.  REPLACEMENT:  The substitution of a scrapped, consumable item with a new item manufactured or approved by the OEM or an unserviceable item which cannot be overhauled in accordance with OEM specifications shall be replaced with new parts manufactured or approved by the OEM.  Other than new replacement parts will need prior Contracting Officer approval.

4.3.  UNUSUAL DAMAGE:  Items which have been severely damaged due to mishandling, mechanical failure or crash damage, or in which assemblies have been cannibalized.  Items, which are missing consumable components, that are required to be replaced during overhaul, are not considered to be unusually damaged.

4.4.  CANNIBALIZED:  Components listed in Section B for which integral parts are missing when the component is provided to the contractor for overhaul.

4.5.  MODIFICATION:  To make basic or fundamental changes on items specified in the schedule of components when required by the Contracting Officer.  The vendor shall also include the part number affixed to the modification.  The contractor must be able to perform upgrades/modifications at the same time as the OEM, if contractor is other than the OEM.

4.6.  B.E.R. Beyond Economical Overhaul:  Items requiring overhaul to the extent that the total cost to overhaul exceeds 75% of the OEM’s new replacement cost, will be considered B.E.R.

4.7.  AOG:  An  “Aircraft on the Ground” condition, indicating that an otherwise operational aircraft is temporarily grounded awaiting overhaul and return of the part or component.  This condition requires the component be handled as a high priority, and that its return be expedited.

4.8.	QUALIFICATION OF PIECE PARTS:  The aircraft engine, and its components are 
considered “flight safety critical aircraft parts”.  The use of piece parts or components other than OEM or DOD approved parts is prohibited without prior express written approval of the Contracting Officer.

4.9.  ACMS:  The Aviation Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS) is a computerized
system used to record scheduled maintenance of aircraft components and assemblies.  The contractor’s duties within ACMS consist of submission of required forms as outlined herein.

5.0.  SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS.  The technical tasks described in this section shall require the contractor to furnish all labor, tooling; test equipment, material and facilities to provide overhaul support for all assemblies and components on an as required basis.  Major tasks include, but are not limited to the following:

5.1	     RECEIPT OF ITEMS:  

5.1.1.	Pump Assemblies and Components:  Upon receipt of repairable items, the contractor
shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing, providing the following information:  (1) date the reparable(s) received; (2) confirmation of serial number(s); (3) confirmation of delivery order number.  Notification via facsimile is acceptable.  If ACMS tracked, identify at this time any components requiring configuration upgrading (modification).  Ensure SCHR and CCRR correspond with component and conduct an inspection IAW manufacturer's specifications.  In addition, when the component is received at the overhaul facility receiving dock, the contractor shall report any preservation or packaging discrepancies, missing parts or assemblies, cannibalized items or unusual damage to the Contracting Officer.

5.1.1.1.  Aviation Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS) Tracked Material:  If a component is ACMS tracked material the contractor shall; 

5.1.1.1.1.  Review the Significant Component History Record (SCHR) for Gas Turbine Assemblies for accuracy and completion.  Report any preservation or packaging discrepancies or missing parts to the Contracting Officer.

5.1.1.1.2.  Initiate a Contract Component Overhaul Record (CCRR) on serial number tracked parts.  The form entry must include the specific reason for component rejection, both primary and secondary if applicable.

5.1.1.1.3.   Annotate CCRR, listing Service Bulletins, which have been incorporated.

5.1.1.2.  Missing Components:  Within 30 calendar days after receipt of a component, the contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing of any missing detail part(s) or sub-assembly(ies).  The Contracting Officer shall then have 45 calendar days to provide formal disposition instructions to the contractor.  The U. S. Coast Guard will be responsible to replace the missing detail part with an RFI or repaired detail part.  A revised contract delivery schedule will be negotiated.

 5.1.1.3.  Cannibalized Components:  Upon receiving components exhibiting cannibalization, the contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer and DCMAO or Coast Guard designated COTR and discontinue all actions until the Contracting Officer determines to proceed with the overhaul/overhaul.  DCMAO or Coast Guard designated COTR shall witness the remaining teardown and inspection of the component and shall be responsible for signing and dating the Contractor’s letter of notification.  DCMAO’s or Coast Guard designated COTR’s signature does not infer acceptance, only acknowledges the claim.  The letter of notification and the inspection/teardown report shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer for disposition.  If overhaul is subsequently authorized, the contractor shall follow the procedures outlined in 5.2.

5.1.1.4.	Unusual Damage:  When components are received and the contractor's inspection
indicates obvious misuse, unusual or severe damage, the contractor shall discontinue all actions until a DCMAO representative or Coast Guard designated COTR is notified and personally witnesses the continuance of inspection and tear down.  The DCMAO representative or Coast Guard designated COTR will be responsible to sign and date the Contractor's Unusual Damage Claim Request.

5.1.1.4.1.  The contractor shall, within fifteen calendar days from date the DCMAO representative or Coast Guard designated COTR witnesses the unusual damage, notify the Contracting Officer that the item is considered unusually damaged and requires an unusual damage evaluation.

 5.1.1.4.2.  The contractor shall, within thirty days from DCMAO or Coast Guard designated COTR verification, submit an Unusual Damage Report and a detailed breakdown covering all parts and overhaul needed to return the unit to the manufacturer's minimum performance specifications.  The detailed breakdown shall contain the National Stock Number (NSN), Part Number (P/N), Nomenclature, serial number, cost breakdown, and a list of replacement parts and disposition of each.  The proposal shall not include the work involved in the tear down/inspection process, as this would have been covered under the firm fixed teardown price.

 5.1.1.4.3.  Within thirty calendar days of receipt of Unusual Damage Report and proposal, the Contracting Officer will either authorize or deny overhaul or initiate negotiations.  Upon mutual agreement as to price, the delivery order will be modified by a supplemental agreement.  If it is in the Coast Guard's best interest not to have material overhauled, the Contracting Officer shall provide the Contractor with disposition instructions to return the material to the Aircraft Repair & Supply Center.   NOTE:  The contractor is at sole risk if material is overhauled prior to Contracting Officer's approval to commence overhaul.

5.2.	 OVERHAUL:  The Contractor shall make necessary repairs to unserviceable
components to return to a serviceable condition as set forth in accordance with Section 2.0 this PWS.  Replace only those parts found missing or defective.  Parts of a component found to be in a serviceable condition as a result of inspection and functional testing shall be reused.

5.2.1.	BEYOND ECONOMICAL REPAIR REQUIREMENT:  The contractor shall provide
actual component repair breakdown and costs when overhaul of the material exceeds 75% of the OEM's new replacement cost. This information will be forwarded to the Contracting Officer who will provide final disposition.   

5.2.2.  NON-REPAIRABLE DETAIL PARTS:  The contractor shall dispose of any part
removed as non-repairable during the overhaul or modification process in accordance with the current ISO 9002 certified procedures.  All ACMS tracked detailed components shall be properly documented on the Disenrollment Card #2572020,submitted IAW Section 5.1.1.1.2.

5.2.3.  CORROSION:  Coast Guard aircraft operate primarily in a saltwater environment and are subject to corrosion. The contractor is advised to expect corrosion on equipment to be overhauled under this requirement. During inspection and functional test, the presence of corrosion in an assembly or component thereof shall constitute reason for a more thorough disassembly and inspection. Should corrosion be found, disassembly shall be made only to the extent necessary to remove corrosion or replace the part(s) affected. Corroded parts shall be replaced except in those cases where removal of corrosion from a part will not impair efficiency or safe operation of the part. Corrosion removal and treatment of affected areas shall be accomplished in accordance with OEM's current specifications and drawings, or shall meet the Contracting Officer's approval when OEM specifications do not exist or are not clear. The contractor shall provide for effects of and removal of corrosion in the firm-fixed overhaul price.

5.3.	ASSEMBLY AND PERFORMANCE TEST:  The contractor shall reassemble all
components upon completion of overhaul and conduct a performance test in accordance with the applicable directive(s) cited in Section 3.0.  The contractor shall record the results of all performance tests and provide this documentation to the government upon request.  
	
5.4.  REPORTS/FORMS: 

5.4.1.  ACMS FORMS: The contractor shall provide a Contract Component Repair Record (CCRR) after completion of overhauled Pump Module Assemblies.  Mail one copy to FC Business Systems, package one copy with APU and send one copy with invoice.

<SUBJECT>D -- Replace Loan Accounting System for Housing for the Elderly (LASHE)
<SOLNBR>R-DEN-01965
<RESPDATE>102904
<ARCHDATE>11122004
<CONTACT>Nancy Royce, Contract Specialist (Team Leader), Phone 303-672-5281 x1812, Fax 303-672-5062, Email Nancy_J._Royce@hud.gov - Tony Karpowicz, Supvy Contract Spec. (Branch Chief), Phone 303-672-5281 x1818, Fax 303-672-5062, Email Tony_M._Karpowicz@hud.gov
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment to solicitation R-DEN-01965, Replace Loan Accounting System for Housing for the Elderly (LASHE), is to respond to questions, provide a demonstration checklist (see website) and extend the date set for receipt of offers to October 29, 2004 at noon. No further questions will be considered for this solicitation. 

1. Question: Although this solicitation is not a total set-aside for award to small business, will HUD exhibit any preference towards small businesses when evaluating the proposals submitted in response to this solicitation? 

Answer: No preferences have been included in the evaluation factors. 

2. Question: Given the detailed nature of the services to be
proposed, will HUD consider extending the proposal submission due date by ten days to allow for adequate time for bidders to prepare comprehensive responses to the large number of requirements? 
Answer: The date set for receipt of proposals has been extended to October 29, 2004 at noon. 

3. Question: Will HUD provide to each vendor the responses to all vendors' questions? 

Answer: Yes 

4. Question: Will HUD consider proposals submitted by an integrator teamed with a software vendor for this opportunity? 
Answer: No 

5. Question: Will HUD accept a proposal for services related to the integration and configuration of software currently owned and operated by HUD in lieu of a proposal for a new software solution to address the requirements of this solicitation? 

Answer: No, HUD is looking to upgrade its systems 

6. Question: Will HUD accept a proposal for integration and implementation services independent of the software solution for this solicitation? 

Answer: No 

7. Question: The RFP describes the current LAS environment as one where only certain changes to the portfolio can be directly entered into the system in an automated manner. This suggests that the system of records for the portfolio is a combination of automated and manual records. Is this correct? If so how many manual records exist? 

Answer: The system is automated. While some changes may be
entered in an automated manner, many still need special programming to modify the system. The only manual records
stored are those used as backup and support for the Ft. Worth staff. That is why we have proposed storing memos in the new system and allowing the ability to scan materials for reference. 

8. Question: For the purpose of system conversion of individual loan records, will the contractor have to certify that the records converted to the system accurately reflect the proprietary information and financial status of the loans or will the government assure that the records are accurate before and/or during the conversion process? 

Answer: HUD would expect a joint effort to bring the loans over accurately; however HUD is aware that some loans may need adjustments in the new system. 

9. Question: Does the portfolio include loans with open balances as well as loans with zero balances? If so how many loan records are considered active? Have the loans been audited or certified/confirmed as being correct? If so, is this 100%
or a lesser percentage? Will inactive loans be migrated? 

Answer: Yes, the portfolio includes loans with open and zero
balances. There are approximately 4,700 Section 202 loans and 900 Section 201 loans that are serviced. The loan system has been audited. There are some anomalies in a few loans that are addressed bi-weekly to rectify them. Section 2.2 of the FRD addresses audit confirmations. Yes, inactive loans will be migrated. 

10. Question: Is it true that only financial assets, as opposed to pre-construction or post-construction assets, will be accounted for in the system?

Answer: The Functional Requirements Document was provided for verification of all requirements of the system. 

11. Question: Are the initiate phase documents referenced in the RFP available to bidders? How can they be accessed?

Answer: The Initiate phase deliverables (i.e. Cost Benefit Analysis and Feasibility Study) are not of relevance to this
work and have not been included for reference. 

12. Question: Has HUD identified the major areas where LAS is not
compliant with JFMIP standards? 

Answer: Yes. The current LAS environment application does not meet standards as set forth in the JFMIP document Requirements for Direct Loans Systems. 

13. Question: Does HUD believe that the requirements for the new system as documented in the RFP, when achieved, will comply with the JFMIP requirements for direct lending? 

Answer: Yes 

14. Question: Are workouts or rescheduling treated as new loans under credit reform?

Answer: Some workouts may result in new loans in the system; however, workouts and rescheduling are managed by Housing/FHA. 

15. Question: How many work outs or rescheduling occur in a year? 
Answer: Numbers may vary from year to year depending on economic factors. 

16. Question: The RFP states that up to 5700 users will access the system. Is it envisioned then that web users will access the system directly as opposed to accessing data via the HUD data mart? If this is the case, please distinguish between data that will be available thru the systems and which data will be
transmitted to the data mart for internal or external use. 

Answer: Yes. Data Mart interface requirements are stated in the
FRD section 6.4. All LAS transaction data is passed daily to the data mart. A borrower or his management agent may only access loans for which they have responsibility. 

17. Question: Does the system or operation being supported
require or use CAIVRS? 

Answer: No 

18. Question: Do operational personnel in Housing or CFO require use of task tracking tools, letter writing / debtor contact tools, or tickler applications as part of the application? Are any debt
collection/case tracking tools beyond "manage references" contemplated or required? 

Answer: All requirements were stated in the FRD. Any offered enhancements will be reviewed. 

19. Question: If the vendor chooses to submit the proposal electronically, can the hard copy be delivered the following day? 
Answer: The electronic proposal and hard copy should both be delivered timely on the due date. 

20. Question: Section 1.9 of the Performance Work Statement,
Evaluation Factor 1, Technical Capability references the LAS RFQ Demo Tasks/Checklist. Is the LAS RFQ Demo Tasks/Checklist document currently available? 

Answer: Yes, it will be posted with this amendment. 

21. Question: On page 8 of the Performance Work Statement under WEB BROWSER ACCESS, there is a requirement for the COTS software to "... be compatible with ... Netscape version 4.75." Our COTS package is engineered to take advantage of certain Microsoft Internet Explorer features in versions 5.5 and above that we believe are not available with Netscape, thus will very likely not perform correctly if accessed via a Netscape browser. We need to know if the Netscape requirement is absolute or if it is flexible as part of the overall consideration of each offering. Specifically, would HUD consider using Microsoft Internet Explorer version 5.5 or above in a firewall- or VPN-secured setting? 
Answer: The Microsoft Internet Explorer is HUD standard now. It was not the standard when the LAS requirements were completed. HUD now uses Microsoft Internet Explorer version 5.5 and can be used in a firewall or VPN-secured setting. 

22. Question: Once the proposals have been submitted, is there an anticipated timeline for HUD to review them and make the initial determination of the competitive range and which vendors fall within that range?

Answer: We anticipate a January 2005 award. Offers are due by 12:00 noon on Friday, October 29, 2004. Offers may be submitted by email to Nancy_J._Royce@hud.gov (NOTE: Offerors are advised that there is a 5 megabyte limit per email), or hand delivered to the following address:
