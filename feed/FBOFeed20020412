<DESC>The Program Manager for Training Systems for the U.S. Marine Corps is conducting a Request For Information (RFI) to determine availability of foreign companies that have Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) mobile Range Instrumentation System (RIS) with capabilities of interest to the USMC, and other Services, for near term production or lease. The USMC has the requirement for a deployable RIS that facilitates the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF), at individual, collective and force-on-force tactical training up to the Infantry Company level. The system must capture detailed performance data for immediate analysis and educational use during the mission After Action Review (AAR). The system will consist of electronic devices on participating entities; a communications infrastructure; data analysis capability; position tracking
  and reporting; and AAR capability. Existing USMC laser-based Tactical Engagement Simulation Systems (TESS) training devices do not fully support MAGTF force-on-force training. This Foreign Comparative Test (FCT) will evaluate these foreign products for integration into the USMC TESS in order to obtain the Deployable Instrumentation (DI) for MAGTF training. Instrumentation of Marines, their vehicles, and their weapon systems by these FCT candidate systems will be evaluated on their ability to enable near real-time position tracking and status reporting and real-time engagement adjudication for all participants within the training range. The system must be capable of integrating into both one-way and two-way laser-based TESS to eliminate the effects of negative training inherent with laser-based TESS. The system must provide area weapons effects simulation for all indirect fire weapons systems in the Marine Corps' inventory, as well as those considered as threat weapon systems.  Minefields, chemical weapons, and terrorist activities will be simulated by the system. It must provide a realistic means of training the proper use and avoidance of simulated indirect fire without placing additional umpires in the field. It must demonstrate how Marines, weapon systems, and vehicles can engage targets with simulated indirect fires. The system will provide participants with realistic and appropriate battlefield audio and visual cues for weapons, weapons effects, computer-generated forces, and interactive targetry. The system will also be used to instrument opposing forces and evaluated for scalability.  The system will support exercise planning, scenario development, exercise control, and provide an AAR based upon recorded movement and engagement data. Instrumentation must readily integrate with individual Marines and their equipment. The U.S. Marine Corps intends to evaluate foreign systems under the DoD FCT Program in order to avoid redundant and expensive RDT&E funding expenditures. These systems will contribute to integration with NATO training exercises. Potential contracts awarded to foreign firms under this FCT will offer leasing or production options.  Additional information is available and can be requested through email from Mr. David Wood, Program Manager at: wooddw@mcsc.usmc.mil or by phone @ (703) 784-3310 (ext.-4-5098). All responses to the request for information are due no later than close of business 30 April 02. Foreign companies with existing DI-RIS capabilities or currently developing the capability that would meet or exceed the above requirements should provide design characteristics and performance data to: PROGRAM MANAGER, PM TRAINING SYSTEMS, ATTN: Mr. David Wood, 2033 Barnett Avenue, Suite 315, Quantico, VA. 22134-5010. FEDEX or UPS deliveries should be sent to Commander, MARCORSYSCOM, 3041A McCawley Avenue, Attn Code CTQ/P.Hake, Quantico, VA 22134-5010. THE SUBMISSION OF THIS INFORMATION IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUCTED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PROCURE ANY ITEMS/SERVICES, OR FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR THE INFORMATION RECEIVED.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Ocean Service (NOS), Coral Mapping Program is seeking a qualified Architectural/Engineering (A/E) firm or organization to provide BENTHIC HABITAT MAPPING and associated services for coastal areas of States, Commonwealths, Territories, and Freely Associated States of the U.S.  NOS intends to negotiate a single award, five-year, performance based, fixed price contract with indefinite-delivery-indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) provisions.  Performance of the first task order for the main Hawaiian Islands (i.e., Hawaii, Maui, Kahoolawe, Lanai, Molokai, Oahu, Kauai, Niihau, and Kaula) is scheduled to commence as early as October 2002.  Performance of optional task orders may include coastal mainland states, Commonwealths, Territories, and Freely Associated States of the U.S. (e.g., Guam, American Samoa, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), Freely Associated States, and/or other Flag Islands) and may commence as early as December 2002.

The NOS cannot guarantee the total amount of work to be assigned under the proposed contract.  The amount of work will vary annually according to NOS needs and available funding.  Task orders will be issued as project requirements are developed.  The maximum ordering limitation will be $5,000,000.00 for the life of the contract.  It is anticipated that the first task order will not exceed twenty-four months, but may be less based upon the proposed timeframe negotiated prior to contract award.  Future task orders for mapping of benthic habitats for optional areas may require services similar in scope, but lesser in magnitude than the first task order for the main Hawaiian Islands.  Pricing of future task orders shall be modeled based on the pricing of the initial task order for the main Hawaiian Islands. 

The Government reserves the right to award the contract based on the selection board's final selection list, in order of preference, to the firm considered most highly qualified to perform the work.  The Contractor will have the option to modify their teaming arrangements as necessary to meet the requirements of the optional task orders.  The Government reserves the right to review, accept, or deny new team members or firms proposed by the contractor for optional task orders.

The following are approximate areas of benthic habitats to be mapped for the regions specified above: main Hawaiian Islands - 1,500 km2; Guam - 125 km2; American Samoa - 130 km2; Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) - 200 km2; Freely Associated States - 10,000 km2 and Other Flag Islands - 700 km2.  The draft task order schedule for planning purposes is as follows, but the Government is not committing to this schedule or these sites at this time: (i) Task Order: Main Hawaiian Islands; Estimated Award: October 2002; Estimated Duration: 24 months. 
(ii) Task Order: American Samoa, CNMI, Guam; Estimated Award: December 2002; Estimated Duration: 12 months. (iii) Task Order: Other Flag Islands; Estimated Award: October 2003; Estimated Duration: 12 months. (iv) Task Order: Freely Associated States; Estimated Award: October 2004; Estimated Duration: 12 months.

Interested parties must be able to demonstrate experience in mapping benthic habitats, especially coral habitats in U.S. or associated waters, from the shoreline to water depths of approximately thirty meters for a maximum of 35 (thirty-five) classification levels.  Benthic habitat mapping experience includes habitat data acquisition, GIS mapping, georeferencing, accuracy assessment, and other associated services.  Interested firms must also be able to demonstrate the availability of a suitable data collection mechanism(s), data processing equipment, and other necessary equipment to support the firm's proposed technology; and sufficient technical, supervisory, administrative, and quality review personnel to ensure expeditious completion and quality of work assignments.  Workassignments may consist of, but are not limited to: (1) performing project and mission planning; (2) acquiring imagery for coastal areas; (3) conducting accuracy assessment; (4) conducting field validation; (5) processing the data including, benthic habitat delineation, identification and mapping; (6) performing quality control throughout all work processes; and (7) the delivery of the data, metadata, reports, and geospatial map products.  The Government anticipates that imagery acquisition will only be required for the first task order for the main Hawaiian Islands.

Selection Criteria

The Government will utilize a two-part technical selection process.  The selection evaluation criteria in relative descending order of importance include: (1) Specialized recent experience and technical competence of the firm, consultants, and staff in mapping benthic habitats using remotely sensed imagery (both airborne and satellite); (2) Proven experience with methods and techniques for airborne and/or satellite imaging platforms and benthic habitat mapping of tropical marine environments; (3) Teaming arrangements comprised of firms from the geographic area being considered with mapping and field-based experience for that area with the selection being based on the team for the first task order (i.e. main Hawaiian Islands); (4) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time (management, personnel, and equipment); (5) Demonstrated professional qualifications, professional registration, technical expertise, and experience of the firm, including all principals and key staff of the firm, its consultants, and individuals listed to perform under the contract, with benthic habitat mapping projects; and (6) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and/or private industry in terms of quality of work, cost control, and compliance to performance schedules, as demonstrated by narrative and by client references.

Following an in-depth evaluation of the qualifications and performance information, three firms considered to be the most highly qualified will be selected for a "short list".  Firms on the "short list" will receive a notice of their initial selection.  The firms will also be given written questions and asked to provide a written Case Study summary for a test area determined by the Government.  The test area for the Case Study will not exceed 10 km2 in size.  In the Case Study the firms shall provide a summary presentation of mission planning; acquiring imagery; conducting accuracy assessment; conducting field validation; processing the data including, benthic habitat delineation, identification and mapping; performing quality control throughout all work processes; proposed teaming arrangement with local experts and constituents; work assignments of key personnel and subcontractors; and the delivery of the data, metadata, reports, and geospatial map products.  The firms are neither expected nor required to acquire imaging data, conduct mapping, or conduct any field-based studies in the test area for purposes of the Case Study.  The firms may also provide color map sample(s) depicting its prior benthic habitat mapping experience in tropical marine environments using the proposed methodologies.  The firm must also provide supporting information for the sample map(s) indicating accuracy assessment statistics; geometric accuracy; details of the benthic classification scheme used; image acquisition approach, specifications, and acquisition team or firm; mapping approach; location; and when the mapping was conducted.  The Government must receive written answers to questions, map sample(s), and a written Case Study report within 10 (ten) days after the "short list" notification in order for the materials to be considered.  Personal interviews with each of the "short list" firms will be conducted approximately 12 (twelve) days after notification to discuss the firm's answers to questions and the Government's evaluation of the benthic mapping sample(s) and the Case Study.  Upon completion of the "short list" interviews, the selection of the most highly qualified firm will be made and a proposal will be requested based upon a Government Statement of Work.  Negotiations will be conducted beginning with the most highly qualified firm, and will proceed until an award is made or all of the short-listed firms have been rejected.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION. IT IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI). NASA does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this information, but hopes to formulate a requirement for advanced avionics technology development based on the need for this type of technology and it's feasibility based upon the responses to this request for information (RFI). This RFI is for internal NASA planning purposes only, and seeks to provide industry and academia the opportunity to verify the reasonableness and feasibility of the prospective requirements.  NASA is seeking ideas and information from potential offerors on the development of advanced avionics technologies to support the Space Launch Initiative (SLI) 2nd Generation Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) Program. Technology areas of interest include (1) an advanced modular avionics Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) that can serve as a building block for the 2nd Gen RLV control and data handling system and is adaptable to any vehicle avionics architecture, (2) a high-speed data bus with deterministic protocol, and (3) advanced real-time software techniques and associated verification processes. All three of these areas are tightly coupled and need to be developed simultaneously in an integrated fashion.  I. Advanced Modular Avionics LRU Of particular interest is information or concepts that address the challenges and issues that must be overcome in developing an avionics LRU with the following characteristics:  -	Ability to support scalable system level fault tolerance (from single string to at least a fail-op, fail-op, fail-safe capability) in a way that is transparent to the performance of the vehicle flight control loops -	Supports detection and isolation of vehicle subsystem faults at the LRU level or lower -	Provides high speed State-of-Art processors capable of supporting Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM) processing requirements as well as flight control requirements -	Advanced packaging that will enable passive thermal control throughout all phases of the mission -	Requires no external shock/vibration isolation system except for possibly extreme vehicle mounting locations (engine, for example) -	Design techniques to minimize total power usage and that provide high power efficiency -	Design features that will minimize the cost and time required for replacement due to obsolescence -	Design features that provide an easy growth path for hardware & software expansion -	Radiation tolerant for ETO (earth to orbit) RLV (reusable launch vehicle) and CTV (Crew Transport Vehicle) environments -	Configurable as both a flight control computer or as a data acquisition and control unit with interface to the high speed bus, as a minimum -	Supports IVHM functions such as diagnostics, trend analysis, and prognostics -	Provides support for critical and non-critical data in the same physical LRU with appropriate partitioning to prevent corruption of the critical functions (subject to vehicle level system trade studies) When focusing on the LRU characteristics above, consideration must also be given to the following requirements: -	High reliability -	Low maintenance with ease of maintainability -	Internal health management, including fault detection and isolation -	Minimum weight and volume -	Flight life of 100 missions minimum - Certifiable for flight-critical use on a crewed space vehicle -	Moderate to low cost with multiple source availability (Cost considerations should be based on life cycle cost and not solely on recurring box cost.) -	Designed to operate in the launch vehicle and space environments including missions to the International Space Station -	Capability to support legacy hardware and its associated I/O, such as the MIL-STD-1553 data bus II. High-speed Data Bus We are interested in suggestions for a high-speed data bus that can support critical flight control functions and the expected high throughput requirements of Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM). Desired characteristics include: -	Significant improvement in throughput as compared with the MIL-STD-1553 bus -	Deterministic bus access protocol to support critical real-time flight control functions -	Implementation of a widely available bus standard  -	High-speed physical layer medium, with an easy growth path to fiber optics or wireless. -	Supports transport of critical and non-critical data on the same physical bus -	Low power consumption -	Rapid fault recovery capabilities -	Built-In-Test and end-to-end connection diagnostics III. Advanced Software In the software area, we are interested in software architectures and techniques that will reduce life cycle costs. The goal is to develop an advanced software architecture that incorporates as many of the following candidate characteristics as feasible: -    Provides robust flight software including data error tolerance, sensor tolerance with respect to replacement of sensors, command validity checking (values, integrity of path, etc) and maintenance of memory integrity (A capability to modify all flight code and data by command, at all memory locations is desired.) -	Provides integrated software health and status. The middleware layer should trap process behavior and physical errors (parity, etc.).   -     Provides flexibility, utilizing a timeline/command processor, bias/calibration adjustment, multiple limits and limit adjustment by command   -     Is deterministic, utilizing rate monotonic scheduling or equivalent -	Supports robust partitioning to provide isolation between critical and non-critical functions and to provide isolation between functions that are likely to require frequent code change from the more static applications -	Provides a modular approach that is easily verified and validated -	Supports automated Verification and validation (V&V) testing techniques.  -	All languages and libraries are certifiable and verifiable -	Low software complexity factor Background and Submission Requirements  I. Technical Background  NASA's Space Launch Initiative (SLI) is focused on reducing technical, business and design risks associated with developing a 2nd Generation Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) system. A 2nd Generation RLV program is aimed at improving safety to a probability of one failure in 10,000 flights while reducing operations costs to $1,000 per pound of payload or less. This represents a hundred-fold improvement in safety and a tenfold improvement in cost. It is anticipated that a technologically advanced avionics system will be a major contributor to meeting these goals. The characteristics of an advanced avionics system described above are central to this objective. The most significant factor to consider in meeting the above goals is the intrinsic safety and reliability of an advanced avionics system.  That system provides the robustness and adaptability to flight anomalies required to meet the 1 in 10,000 failure rate. Furthermore, an advanced avionics system that incorporates all intelligence needed for diagnosis and prognosis will drastically reduce the operations cost by negating the need for a large ground crew to turn the vehicle around.  Embedded sensing will provide automated flight worthiness verification during the turn-around process. Adaptive controls and embedded genetic algorithms will provide in-flight anomaly resolution and correction while  multiple internal redundancy will provide continuous, uninterrupted operation in the event of hardware failure. The lack of active cooling and resultant decrease in electrical energy and cooling support systems will greatly improve overall reliability and safety while reducing operations cost through the elimination of systems that require significant maintenance. II. Response Requirements This request is not intended for information concerning technologies that are at a very embryonic state of development. Advanced technology concepts should be explored to the extent that technical feasibility has been demonstrated. These should be at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 3 or higher. Any technology that is advocated should be capable of being developed to a TRL 6 over a 40-month period with a moderate risk scenario. The goal is to develop an avionics system that offers the characteristics mentioned above. Technology Readiness Levels widely used by NASA are defined in a 1995 white paper by John C. Mankins of the NASA Office of Space Access and Technology as follows: TRL 3 - Analytical and experimental critical function and/or characteristic proof-of-concept  At this step in the maturation process, active research and development (R&D) is initiated. This must include both analytical studies to set the technology into an appropriate context and laboratory-based studies to physically validate that the analytical predictions are correct. These studies and experiments should constitute "proof-of-concept" validation of the technology applications/concepts being addressed. For example, a concept for High Energy Density Matter (HEDM) propulsion might depend on slush or super-cooled hydrogen as a propellant: TRL 3 might be attained when the concept-enabling phase/temperature/pressure for the fluid was achieved in a laboratory.  TRL 4 - Component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environment  Following successful "proof-of-concept" work, basic technological elements must be integrated to establish that the "pieces" will work together to achieve concept-enabling levels of performance for a component and/or breadboard. This validation must be devised to support the concept that was formulated earlier, and should also be consistent with the requirements of potential system applications. The validation is relatively "low-fidelity" compared to the eventual system: it could be composed of ad hoc discrete components in a laboratory. For example, a TRL 4 demonstration of a new 'fuzzy logic' approach to avionics might consist of testing the algorithms in a partially computer-based, partially bench-top component (e.g., fiber optic gyros) demonstration in a controls lab using simulated vehicle inputs.  TRL 5 - Component and/or breadboard validation in relevant environment At this level, the fidelity of the component and/or breadboard being tested has to increase significantly. The basic technological elements must be integrated with reasonably realistic supporting elements so that the total applications (component-level, sub-system level, or system-level) can be tested in a 'simulated' or somewhat realistic environment. From one-to-several new technologies might be involved in the demonstration. For example, a new type of solar photovoltaic material promising higher efficiencies would at this level be used in an actual fabricated solar array 'blanket' that would be integrated with power supplies, supporting structure, etc., and tested in a thermal vacuum chamber with solar simulation capability. TRL 6 -System/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment (ground or space)  A major step in the level of fidelity of the technology demonstration follows the completion of TRL 5. At TRL 6, a representative model or prototype system or subsystem - which would go well beyond ad hoc, 'patch-cord' or discrete component level breadboard - would be tested in a relevant environment. At this level, if the only 'relevant environment' is the environment of space, then the model/prototype must be demonstrated in space. Of course, the demonstration should be successful to represent a true TRL 6. At this point, the maturation step is driven more by assuring management confidence than by R&D requirements. The demonstration might represent an actual system application, or it might only be similar to the planned application, but using the same technologies At this level, several-to-many new technologies might be integrated into the demonstration. For example, a innovative approach to high temperature/low mass radiators, involving liquid droplets and composite materials, would be demonstrated to TRL 6 by actually flying a working, sub-scale (but scaleable) model of the system on a Space Shuttle or International Space Station 'pallet'. In this example, the reason space is the 'relevant' environment is that micro-gravity plus vacuum plus thermal environment effects will dictate the success/failure of the system - and the only way to validate the technology is in space. The following information is requested in accordance with instructions in section III below:  1.	A list of related technologies and experience within your organization or company that would support the NASA technology needs as described above. For each technology identified, provide a brief description of the technology, how it would support the NASA need, an assessment of your current Technology Readiness Level and a Rough-Order-of-Magnitude estimate of cost and the time required to raise the technology to a TRL of 6. 2.	If appropriate for your organization, provide your assessment of the difficulty/ feasibility of accomplishing all or the majority of the NASA desired technologies. For example, do you feel that the design of an advanced avionics LRU with all of the desired characteristics is achievable and feasible within the given timeframe?  3.	Provide the name of a business and technical point of contact for your organization or company along with their phone number, e-mail address and mailing address. III. Submittal Instructions  Response to this RFI is open to all U.S. organizations or teams of organizations from industry (traditional and non-traditional), educational institutions, nonprofit organizations (includes not-for-profit organizations), and U.S. Government agencies. Respondents should address all the items in the order that they are listed in Section II. In the spirit of an RFI, no overall page limit is required and no response will be excluded from review. All proprietary information should be marked. Responses will be handled accordingly. One (1) original hardcopy and two (2) electronic copies of your response to this RFI are requested. The electronic copies shall be in Microsoft Office Suite (Word, Excel, or PowerPoint) or Adobe Acrobat (pdf) format on a zip disk or CD ROM. One (1) original hardcopy and one (1) electronic copy shall be submitted no later than 4:00 PM CST on May 17, 2002, to the attention of Mark King, ED15, Building 4487, Room C229, NASA / Marshall Space Flight Center, Marshall Space Flight Center, AL 35812 .

<DESC>This requirement is being advertised under full and open competition.  The purpose of the proposed contract is (a) to conduct meta-analyses of epidemiologic studies of the association between alcohol consumption and a wide variety of health conditions thought to be associated (positively or negatively) with different levels of alcohol consumption, and (b) to estimate the fractions of U.S. morbidity and mortality from various conditions which are attributable to alcohol consumption, based on summary measures of relative risk for these conditions which have been estimated by meta-analysis.  (If a relative risk of less than 1.0 is estimated for a condition [i.e., if exposure to alcohol is found to be protective against morbidity and mortality], fractions which permit estimating the number as cases/deaths prevented will be developed.)  The successful offeror must exhibit a clear understanding of the conceptual, methodological, and empirical issues involved in applying meta-analysis techniques to epidemiologic studies of the health consequences of alcohol consumption.  In addition, the successful offeror must have demonstrated ability to perform the activities called for in the Statement of Work as reflected in the experience, expertise, and publications (peer-reviewed and other) of project staff.  This acquisition is a new requirement.  NIAAA anticipates awarding a performance-based cost-reimbursement type contact for a period of three-years.  It is anticipated that this Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued on or about April 26, 2002 with proposals due on or about June 6, 2002. This RFP will be available through the Internet.

<DESC>NASA has designed a course focusing on areas of business management that are critical for success in competing for NASA contracts and subcontracts.  The NASA course is known as Training and Development of Small Businesses in Advanced Technologies (TADSBAT).  The Internet Home Page for the NASA Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization contains additional information on this program at:   http://www.mta-inc.com   BACKGROUND: NASA's Fiscal Year 1990 Appropriations Bill, Public Law 101-144 and its amended version Public Law 101-507, included a requirement that the Agency annually award at least eight percent of the total value of its contracts and subcontracts to Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDBs).  In the legislation, the SDB definition was expanded to include small women-owned businesses, Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institutions (e.g., Tribal College and Hispanic Serving Institutions).  The TADSBAT course was created to enhance the business management capabilities of these firms and institutions so that they could successfully compete for and win NASA business.  Since 1994, NASA has provided this training to over 200 businesses with overwhelming success.  The course is offered FREE (no registration fee). ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS: Participation in the training has been expanded to include all small businesses, along with Small Disadvantaged Businesses (including women-owned), Historically Black College and Universities and Minority Institutions that possess technical capabilities related to NASA's mission and the four strategic enterprises as discussed in NASA's strategic plan at:   http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/nsp/cover.html   BASIC  COURSE: May 14-16, 2002 Sheraton Albuquerque Uptown Albuquerque, New Mexico Course #MTA-0203 									 All classes are limited to 50-55 participants.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

RFP No. 492-92-008
Strengthening Social Acceptance of Family Planning in the Philippines:
A Communications and Advocacy Program.
Amendment No. 2

1. On Section I, Contract Clauses, incorporate in full AIDAR 752.7016, Family Planning and Population Assistance Activities (Aug 1986) as follows:

?I.9. AIDAR 752.7016 FAMILY PLANNING AND POPULATION ASSISTANCE ACTIVITIES (AUG 1986)
  
   (a) Voluntary Participation. (1) The Contractor agrees to take any steps necessary to ensure that funds made available under this contract will not be used to coerce any individual to practice methods of family planning inconsistent with such individual's moral, philosophical, or religious beliefs. Further, the Contractor agrees to conduct its activities in a manner, which safeguards the rights, health and welfare of all individuals who take part in the program.
  
     (2) Activities which provide family planning services or information to individuals, financed in whole or in part under this contract, shall provide a broad range of family planning methods and services available in the country which the activity is conducted or shall provide information to such individuals regarding where such methods and services may be obtained.
  
   (b) Prohibition on Abortion-related Activities. No funds made available under this Contract shall be used to finance, support, or be attributed to the following activities: (i) Procurement or distribution of equipment intended to be used for the purposes of inducing abortions as a method of family planning: (ii) special fees or incentives to women to coerce or motivate them to have abortions; (iii) payments to persons to perform abortions or to solicit persons to undergo abortions; (iv) information, education, training, or communication programs that seek to promote abortion as a method of family planning; (v) any biomedical research which relates, in whole or in part, to methods of, or the performance of, abortions or involuntary sterilization as a means of family planning (epidemiologic or descriptive research to assess the incidence, extent or consequences of abortion is not precluded); or (vi) lobbying for abortion.
  
   (c) Voluntary Participation Requirements for Sterilization Programs.
  
     (1) None of the funds made available under this contract shall be used to pay for the performance of involuntary sterilization or to coerce or provide any financial incentive to any person to practice sterilization.
  
     (2) The Contractor shall insure that any surgical sterilization procedures supported in whole or in part by funds from the contract are performed only after the individual has voluntarily come to the treatment facility and has given an informed consent to the sterilization procedure. Informed consent means the voluntary knowing assent from the individual given after being advised of the surgical procedures to be followed, the attendant discomforts and risks, the benefits to be expected, the availability of alternative methods of family planning, the purpose of the operation and its irreversibility, and the fact that the consent can be withdrawn at any time prior to the operation. An individual's consent is considered voluntary if it is based upon the exercise of free choice and is not obtained by any special inducement or any element of force, fraud, deceit, duress or other forms of coercion or misrepresentation.
  
     (3) Further, the Contractor shall document the patient's informed consent by: (i) A written consent document in a language the patient understands and speaks, which explains the basic elements of informed consent, as set out above, and which is signed by the individual and by the attending physician or by the authorized assistant of the attending physician; or (ii) when a patient is unable to readadequately a written certification signed by the attending physician or by the authorized assistant of the attending physician that the basic elements of informed consent above were orally presented to the patient, and that the patient thereafter consented to the performance of the operation. The receipt of the oral explanation shall be acknowledged by the patient's mark on the certification and by the signature or mark of the witness who shall be of the same sex and speak the same language as the patient.
  
     (4) Copies of the informed consent forms and certification documents for each voluntary sterilization (VS) procedure must be retained by the performing Contractor or subcontractor for a period of three years after the performance of the sterilization procedure.
  
   (d) The Contractor shall insert the substance of this clause in any subgrants, subcontracts, purchase orders, and other subordinate agreements hereunder whenever appropriate to the goods and services to be provided under such agreements.
 
2. Response to additional Questions received:

Q.1.  Will winning organizations be obligated to ask partner organizations in the Philippines to certify that they do not address, advocate for, or provide abortion under the Global prohibition rule?
A.1.  Yes.  All clauses applicable to the prime contractor flows down to its subcontractors and partner organizations.  Please note that AIDAR 752.7016, Family Planning and Population Assistance Activities (AUG 1986), has been incorporated into the RFP through this Amendment.

Q.2.  Should our communication and advocacy program target geographic areas with the highest population growth rates or cover the entire country?
A.2.  No, the program is intended to be national in scope.  However, during implementation, depending upon the situational analysis, it may be necessary to focus on selected geographic areas.

Q.3.  The third activity listed under Section C.IV.A (page 9) focuses on improving the knowledge and attitude of health care providers towards family planning.  In designing training activities for this population, are there certain USAID-affiliated provider networks we should target?
A.3.  No, there are none.  We envision family planning to be part of the routine health service package that all health providers will offer their clients, be they public or private, program-funded or not.

Q.4.  Procedures for obtaining authorization concerning communications products that may exceed $25,000.
A.4.  Considering the nature of this Communications and Advocacy Program, communication products shall be authorized under the contract.  Approval for such products (e.g., printed materials, photographic services or video production services) that may exceed $25,000 will be obtained from the LPA.

Q.5.  Is it possible to send the proposals via FedEx or DHL?
A.5.  Yes, proposals may be sent to the Office of Regional Procurement, USAID/Philippines, through courier services, but must be received before closing time and date, April 26, 2002 at 3:00pm, to be considered.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

SEARCH AND EXAMINATION SUPPORT FOR THE USPTO

INTRODUCTION:  The US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is conducting market research to identify organizations that have the technical capabilities to support Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) activities performed at the USPTO.  This market research shall be conducted at NO COST TO THE GOVERNMENT.  This announcement is a Request For Information (RFI), not a solicitation announcement for proposals, and accordingly, no contract will be awarded from this announcement.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests.  No telephone calls requesting a solicitation will be accepted or acknowledged.  There is no solicitation available at this time nor is there any guarantee or promise of a solicitation in the future.  Any information provided to USPTO as a result of this announcement shall focus on the capability to provide scientific and technical services, as defined below.  Strong relationships with industry is a top priority of USPTO, and USPTO wishes to express its appreciation in advance to all organizations that choose to provide information in accordance with this announcement.
  
BACKGROUND:  As an International Searching Authority under Chapter I of the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), the USPTO receives international applications that require the performance of an international search to discover relevant prior art.  This international search is made on the basis of the application?s claims and results in the preparation of an international search report.  The substance of the search report consists of the most pertinent prior art cited against the claims of the Chapter I application according to PCT convention.  

As an International Preliminary Examining Authority under Chapter II of the PCT, the USPTO receives ?demands? from international applicants for international preliminary examination of an application.  The international preliminary examination takes into consideration all of the prior art cited in the international search report.  If analysis of this prior art supports a determination that any claim lacks novelty, non-obviousness, or industrial applicability, a written opinion is required to be sent to the applicant.  Following an applicant?s response, a preliminary, non-binding examination report is prepared.  This examination report states, relative to each application claim, whether the claim appears to satisfy the criteria of novelty, non-obviousness, and industrial applicability.

Both Chapter I applications and Chapter II demands filed with the USPTO are initially reviewed and processed in PCT Operations.  Chapter II demands are associated with the corresponding Chapter I application file.  Following completion of the initial processing, each application or demand is forwarded to the appropriate Tech Center (TC) where its contents are reviewed and analyzed and the appropriate action is taken.  For a Chapter I application, a complete and comprehensive search of pertinent art is conducted, and a search report is prepared.  For a Chapter II demand, the prior art is reviewed, a written opinion is prepared when required, and a preliminary examination report is prepared.  The search or examination report and/or the written opinion is reviewed for completeness and quality after which it, along with the application file, is returned to PCT Operations where staff mail the report and the file is sent to the PCT file room for storage.

The USPTO is considering acquiring services to perform searches and prepare search reports for PCT applications filed under Chapter I AND/OR to perform examination and prepare written opinions and preliminary examination reports for PCT Chapter II demands.  USPTO is anxious to hear from organizations that can perform EITHER Chapter I OR Chapter II services.  Performance of this work requires technical knowledge sufficient to understand and analyze the technical patent application, knowledge and understanding of the U.S. and International Patent Classification (IPC) Systems, and the ability to conduct in-depth searches using a variety of electronic databases.  Additionally, this work requires technical knowledge sufficient to understand and analyze the technical patent application and related prior art, knowledge and understanding of the US and IPC systems, and the ability to determine the novelty, non-obviousness, and industrial applicability of claimed inventions.

USPTO is also seeking industry opinions concerning performance-based measurements.  Specifically, USPTO would like to gather opinions as to what measurements a contractor feels would be applicable for a potential contract for services described in this announcement.  Additionally, USPTO is seeking industry opinion as to what would be a fair and accurate methodology for assessing past performance for a potential solicitation regarding these services.

CHAPTER I SCOPE:  Any provider of Chapter I services will:

1.	Review and analyze PCT applications, conduct for each claim in an application appropriate and comprehensive searches of pertinent electronic databases, and prepare the required search reports within 30 days of receiving applications;
2.	As needed, draft or redraft an abstract for each application and develop an appropriate application title.

CHAPTER II SCOPE:  Any provider of Chapter II services will:

1.	Review each of the claims contained in an international application; consider, at a minimum, all documents cited in the associated international search report; determine whether each claim appears to satisfy the criteria of novelty, inventive step (non-obviousness), and industrial applicability; prepare a written opinion within 30 days of receiving the demand request; consider any applicant response to written opinions; and prepare a preliminary examination report within 30 days of receiving the applicant response or the end of the  response period.

For Chapter I services, the USPTO may require entry of data into USPTO?s Patent Application Locating and Monitoring (PALM) system and/or other data bases, and will require the submission of periodic performance reports, close coordination with the USPTO to address problems with applications, and the preparation of complete and high-quality search reports.  Chapter II services may require written opinions, and/or examination reports in accordance with required formats.  For Chapter I services, appropriate databases to be utilized in the searching of applications will be determined in accordance with guidance provided by the USPTO.  Additionally, review of biotech sequence applications will utilize search reports provided by the USPTO from its ABSS system or other source for Chapter I services.  For either Chapter I or Chapter II services, source documents may be provided electronically or on paper.  Any provider of either Chapter I or Chapter II services will be required to maintain the confidentiality of all patent applications and related data to which access is provided.  Furthermore, each employee will be required to sign a nondisclosure statement.  Approximately 23,000 applications are expected to require preparation of a Chapter I search report in FY 02.  Approximately 22,000 demands are expected to be received and require preparation of a Chapter II examination report; the majority of these will also require the preparation of a written opinion.

<SUBJECT>--Surface Transportation Management System Development,Implementation and Maintenance.
<DESC>NA This is not a Request For Proposals(RFP).  Draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) FOR the acquisition of Technical Support Services for Headquarters, Military Traffic Management Command, 200 Stovall Road, Alexandria, VA, solicitation DAMT01-02-R-0057. Specifically, MTMC operates two legacy informat ion technology (IT) systems that support management of surface transportation operations. The Integrated Booking System (IBS) manages all MTMC point-to-point ocean cargo traffic, and the Global Freight Management (GFM) system manages all other MTMC surface  movement traffic (rail, truck, inland waterway, etc.). These systems have supported MTMC operations for years, but a recent internal reorganization study (aimed at consolidating resources and focused on core business processes) questioned the need for sep arate surface movement systems. MTMC developed these systems internally to help manage unique DoD transportation requirements when surface transportation management focused on modal and regional traffic. Recently, the management focus, commercial software capabilities, and logistics requirements have expanded, allowing a broader “end-to-end” view that transcends modal and regional barriers. MTMC consolidated all modes of traffic, worldwide, into a single surface movement division, but it continues to rely o n information from systems designed with the original focus. HQ MTMC desires to replace these legacy systems with an integrated surface movement capability, focused on end-to-end transportation management, which handles all modes of surface traffic. The anticipated period of Source Selection is 20 July 2002 through approximately 20 Sept 2002. This is not a Request For Proposals(RFP). The intent of this request is to obtain comments from interested parties to gain insight into industry best practices. The draft RFP will be refined for future inclusion in an RFP. HQ MTMC requests that industry carefully review the draft RFP and offer comments no later than close of business 22 April 2002. The Government will consider all questions and comments received f rom potential offerors.  Any changes made will be at the sole discretion of the Contracting Officer. Time does not permit individual responses to submitters’ comments. This is an industry announcement only. There is no solicitation available at this time. Proposals are not requested at this time and will not be considered. Any information submitted is voluntary. The Government will not pay for any information that is submitted in response to this request for industry comment. The draft PWS will be available  on or about 15 April 2002 and may only be viewed at http://www.mtmc.army.mil/frontDoor/0,1383,OID=5--30---,00.html. The Government will not provide hard copy (paper sets) or CD-ROM of the draft PWS. Comments should be simultaneously e-mailed directly to M r.
