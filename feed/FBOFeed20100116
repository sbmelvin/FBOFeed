<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) San Diego, Port Hueneme Site, CA is currently soliciting offers for engineering services which will directly support Commander, Naval Operational Test and Evaluation Force (COMOPTEVFOR).  The government intends to negotiate and award a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for engineering and analytical support services for the operational testing and evaluation (OT&E) of aircraft as required by the  COMOPTEVFOR. This requirement will be solicited utilizing full and open competition. The solicitation and resulting contract will be for one base year and four additional one-year option periods. The main testing squadron supported by this acquisition will be Air Test and Evaluation Squadron NINE (VX-9). The scope of this acquisition includes engineering and technical support for all phases of OT&E. OT&E may be divided up into early involvement, OT&E planning, OT&E execution, OT&E reporting, and in-service monitoring phases. The OT&E phases may be generally described as follows: Early Involvement: This is the earliest OT&E phase of a program, and typically begins more than one year prior to the first scheduled OT&E event. Tasks and deliverables during this phase focus on planning and resourcing future OT&E, and coordination with DT&E (Developmental Test and Evaluation).  OT&E Planning: This includes preparation for an OT&E phase of a program that will typically occur within one year. Tasks and deliverables during this phase center on detailed test planning and scheduling. DT&E coordination continues. OT&E Execution: This includes executing the actual OT&E. Tasks during this phase focus on scheduling, coordination, briefing, participation in, and debriefing test events. Deliverables focus on data collection and anomaly reporting. OT&E Reporting. This phase of OT&E centers on drafting the OT&E report after completion of the testing. This phase is time limited. Tasks include data collection and analysis. The draft final report deliverable is the contractor's prime focus during this phase. In-Service Monitoring. This optional phase occurs after OT&E is completed, reported, and the tested system is fielded. COMOPTEVFOR and VX-9 may determine a need exists to situate an analyst on-site with a fleet unit employing a system VX-9 recently completed testing on. Tasks focus on monitoring the performance of the fielded system. Deliverables include anomaly reports and drafts standard USN/USMC deficiency reports. Estimated performance start date is March 1, 2010.  Potential Offerors are hereby notified that the solicitation and subsequent amendments to the solicitation will only be available by downloading the documents at http://www.neco.navy.mil or at http://www.fedbizopps.gov. This office will not issue hard-copy solicitations. The NAICS code applicable to this procurement is 541330. A Small Business Subcontracting Plan will be required from all large business offerors. Award will be made on a best-value basis; price and other factors are being considered.  An industry day is planned for the week of 5 October 2009 at Naval Air Warfare Center, China Lake, CA.  The exact date and time will be posted via an amendment to this notice.  The anticipated release date for draft RFP number N00244-09-R-0072 is October 5, 2009.  The final RFP is planned for release one week after the Industry Day.  The RFP will close approximately 30 days after issuance. The closing date and time will be specified on the cover page of the RFP document.   The government will attempt to post draft documents to the NECO website as they become available. Interested parties are therefore encouraged to check the NECO website frequently for updates. Industry questions and comments while the documents are in draft phase are highly encouraged and should be sent to the POC via email as early as soon as possible after the draft documents have been posted.

Hard and electronic copies of all volumes will be required to be received by the Contracting Office at the address provided in the RFP by the closing date and time specified in order to be considered for award.
