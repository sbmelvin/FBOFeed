<DESC>This announcement replaces solicitation Number GS-00P-03-CYD-0113 that was originally synopsized July 11, 2003 and later cancelled in its entirety on August 5, 2003.  
The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in Public Architecture for Supplemental Architect-Engineer/Interior Design Services for the Public Buildings Service (PBS) First Impressions Program and Related States, Nationwide.  The First Impressions program is a collaboration of the GSA and other Federal Agencies.  Building on the success of the Design Excellence program for federal buildings, this program’s mission is to enhance the public’s perception of the GSA and the federal government by improving the appearance of efficiency of GSA buildings.  These buildings belong to the American public and exist to serve them.  Public architecture forms a meaningful image in our collective imagination.  Together, we can make it the best image possible; one of an efficient, effective, and professional government.  The factors that most influence visitors’ first impressions of the building include: the approach and immediate exteriors; building lobbies and corridors; elevators; stairs and escalators; agency entrances and public concession areas.  Functional support and expertise for the First Impressions program will typically be in the areas of; transforming the building image; reducing clutter; consolidating functions; unifying signage; and streamlining security.  This procurement will establish Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quality (IDIQ) Contracts to provide design and related services for federal facilities; owned, leased and/or controlled nationwide.  This contract is national in scope, supporting all existing and future federal and other types of real property.  Multiple A-E contracts may be awarded.  A majority of small businesses may be selection under this solicitation.  A geographically diverse group of firms will be sought.  All work will be procured through the issuance of individual Work/Delivery Orders, each defined by a separate scope of work.  The term of the contracts shall be for one (1) base year period, followed by four (4) one year option periods, not to exceed $4,000,000 for each period, for an aggregate dollar value of $20,000,000.  Consideration for these contracts will be nationwide.  The scope of the design A-E services may include, but not be limited to, the following: pre-design programming, site survey and investigation, design security enhancements; space planning, plaza design, design programming, interior design, signage and graphics design, complete design services, computer aided design and drafting (CADD), working drawings, specifications, cost estimating, landscape design, design review, value engineering services, post construction contract services (PCCS) and other required supplemental services if so requested.  This is a request for Qualifications under Design Excellence.  The A-E firm as used in this RFQ is an association, joint venture partnership or other entity that will have contractual responsibility for the project design.  The Lead Designer is the individual or design studio that will have primary responsibility to conceive the design concept and the building’s architecture.  The A-E firm must address the contractual relationship with the Lead Designer and project team in Stage II.  A-E firms are advised that this is a national contract and as such, projects may be located anywhere within the United States.

All documentation will be in an 8-1/2” x 11” format.  The portfolio should include the following:  a cover letter referencing the FBO announcement and briefly describing the firm and its location, organizational makeup, and noteworthy accomplishments; and modified Standard Form 254 (Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire) and Standard Form 255 (Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire for Specific Projects).  Identification of consultants is not required at this stage.  The assembled Stage I portfolio should be no more than ½ inch thick.  STAGE I submission requirements and evaluation criteria: (1) PAST PERFORMANCE ON DESIGN (35%):  The A-E firm will submit graphics (maximum of three pages per project) of not more than five renovation projects completed in the last ten years.  Illustrations should document the before and after conditions for each of the selection projects.

A portion of one page presented for each project must include a representative floor plan and either a site plan or a building section.  Images of the space before and after renovation should be clearly labeled.  (2) PHILOSOPHY AND DESIGN INTENT (25%):  In the Lead Designer’s words, (maximum of two typewritten pages) state his/her personal design philosophy and approach to the challenge of public architecture, issues, and parameters that may apply in creating lobbies, plazas and other public spaces that are by their very nature imbued with political and national meaning.  (3) LEAD DESIGNER PROFILE (15%): Submit a biographical sketch (maximum of three pages) including education, professional experience, recognition for design efforts inclusive of examples.  Identify and describe areas of responsibility and commitment to each project.  (4) LEAD DESIGNER PORTFOLIO (25%):  Submit a portfolio representative of the Lead Designer’s ability to provide design excellence.

Include tangible evidence where possible such as certificates, awards, peer recognition, etc., demonstrating design excellence.  Where there is duplication with criteria (1), the Lead Designer will address his or her participation in the project.  An A-E Evaluation Board consisting of a private sector peer and representatives of GSA will evaluate the submissions.  A geographically diverse group of firms will be sought.  The Board will establish a short-list of eight to twelve firms.  For STAGE II, the short-listed firms will be notified and asked to submit more detailed information indicating each member of the design team, including all outside consultants.  The firm will be required to complete Standard Form 254 and 255 that reflect the entire design team.  The Government will establish the detailed evaluation criteria and the date that these submittals are due and provide the selection criteria for the interviews along with the Stage I short-list announcement.  Sufficient time will be provided for the A-E Design Firm/Lead Designer to establish its team.  The Board will interview each team.  Candidates should be prepared to discuss all aspects of the criteria indicated above and to demonstrate their ability to fulfill all project requirements.  Emphasis will be placed on the unique aspects of the project, design philosophy, possible approaches in carrying out the project and project management.  The Stage II evaluations will include an interview with the A-E Evaluation Board.  Firms selected to participate in STAGE II will be further evaluated by an anonymous, one-day design charette, judged by a jury of independent design professionals.  The purpose of the design charrette is to further evaluate the A-E’s qualifications for the project.  The designer’s “vision” will weigh substantially in the selection of the A-E Teams by GSA.  The submitted design charrette concepts become the property of the Government.  The design charrette proposals will be used in conjunction with Stage II rankings in the final evaluation of the A-E firms.  Stage II rankings will be used in conjunction with Stage I rankings to select the winning A-E firm(s).

Solicitation for Construction Services to retrofit the HVAC system for the prisoner holding and transfer areas at the U.S. Courthouse, 5400 Federal Plaza, Hammond, Indiana, to ensure that the airborne pathogens are not allowed to infiltrate the air systems serving the rest of the courthouse.

At the transfer corridor on the lower level and holding areas on the second, third, and fourth levels, ductwork will be reworked and existing VAV boxes or air handling units will provide supply air.  Reworked duct, together with new exhaust fans with HEPA filters, will exhaust the air.  Existing mechanical, electrical and plumbing elements will be relocated, if required, to install the new ductwork.

<DESC>The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), National Institutes of Health (NIH) is planning to study off-patent drugs for pediatric use information, based on the Best Pharmaceutical for Children Act process.  Federal legislation and the regulations of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) require that drugs be tested for safety and efficacy before they are approved for clinical use.  This testing must take place in all populations in which the drug will be used.  Since both the qualitative and quantitative aspects of pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics are different in immature individuals, and clinical efficacy and safety may not always be extrapolated from older patient populations to pediatric populations, studies must be conducted in the appropriate pediatric population before pediatric use information may be appropriately incorporated in the label.  The contracts will be awarded to entities that have expertise in conducting pediatric clinical trials, including qualified universities, hospitals, Contracts Research Organizations (CROs), federally funded networks (such as the Pediatric Pharmacology Research Unit Network), and other public or private institutions.  The study sites will be called Pediatric Off-Patent Drugs Study (PODS) Centers.  Lead centers which subcontract to other clinical sites, pediatric clinical trials networks, CROs, and single academic centers are all eligible for contract awards depending on the overall qualifications, experience in drug trials in pediatrics, type of drug under study, specific drug indication and access to target pediatric populations.  It is expected that most studies will involve multiple sites.  Established pediatric drug trials networks or offerors that include multiple sites are encouraged to apply.  Offerors responding to the RFP are requested to develop study protocols involving the use of  sodium nitroprusside  in pediatric populations according to the specifications listed in the Statement of Work (SOW) in the RFP.  Sodium nitroprusside  is commonly used for  maintaining periods of hypotension during pediatric surgical procedures.  However, there is limited information available about dosing, pharmacokinetics, effectiveness and safety in pediatric patients who are maintained in states of controlled hypotension for either short or long periods.  In these clinical investigations, studies of safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic relationships, and dosing in pediatric patients requiring long-term controlled hypotension will be conducted using randomized, observer-blinded approaches.  Investigators will recruit a broad spectrum of patients who require periods of controlled hypotension.  It is anticipated that 200 patients must complete the studies specified in the Statement of Work, including the FDA's Written Request.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541990.  The Request for Proposals (RFP) will be available on or about May 8,2003 at http://FedBizOpps.gov.  All responses must be submitted on or before August 10,2003 to:  Mrs. Mya N. Hlaing, Contracting Officer, NICHD, CMB, 6100 Building, Suite 7A-07, 6100 EXECUTIVE Blvd., MSC 7510, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7510 (if sending by overnight carrier, use 6100 Executive Blvd., Suite 7A-07, Rockville, Maryland 20852).  Fully electronic copies will not be accepted.  The referenced number to use for this announcement is: RFP-NICHD-2003-09.  All correspondence must cite the referenced number as provided.

<DESC>National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Dryden Flight Research Center (DFRC) intends to issue a contract/blanket purchase agreement (BPA) to Invocon, Incorporated of Conroe, Texas as a follow-on contract/BPA for "Miscellaneous Data Acquisition Equipment and Network Integration Services".	This service will be acquired through a "task order" type arrangement. Objective:  The contractor will be tasked by NASA DFRC on a task order basis to support acquisition of data acquisition and network integration services necessary for research and development in distributed signal processing tools and techniques. NASA DFRC intends to procure this service directly from Invocon, Incorporated of Conroe, Texas.  The authority for Other Than Full and Open Competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.	Justification is based upon Invocon's unique and proprietary capabilities to provide this service to continue acquisition of data acquisition and network integration services necessary for research and development in distributed signal processing tools and techniques.  This encompasses COTS and prototype instrumentation nodes, wireless networking within and between aircraft, networking via satellite, supporting hardware and software, in addition to any hardware or software engineering support associated with developing a distributed measurement acquisition and telemetry processing environment.  Award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the government not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Agency's requirements. This procurement will be conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The Government intends to acquire a commercial service using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications statements to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 4:00PM (PST), 11/07/2003.  Such statements will be evaluated solely for determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications will not be accepted in response to this notice.  An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for the Station-Shuttle Power Transfer System (SSPTS).  The SSPTS project will provide the capability to transfer International Space Station (ISS) power to the Space Shuttle Orbiter while the Shuttle Orbiter is docked to the ISS in order to extend the mission duration.  The scope of this effort includes system integration of the power transfer function between ISS and SSP:  development, qualification, manufacturing, test and installation of a power conversion Line Replacement Unit (LRU) on all three shuttle Orbiters; associated Shuttle Orbiter modifications, and associated ISS modifications required to support this functionality. The SSPTS Project extends Orbiter-ISS docked time by transferring ISS 120VDC power to Orbiter, where it is converted to Orbiter-standard 28VDC. The SSPTS Project deliverables consist of kits installed on both ISS and Shuttle Orbiter vehicles such as Extravehicular Activity (EVA) installed wiring harnesses on ISS, wiring modifications and associated control functionality on all three Orbiters, and new 120V to 28V Orbiter Power Converter Unit LRU design. NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from Boeing Space and Communications Group.  The SSPTS requires intimate knowledge of both ISS and Shuttle Electrical Power Systems to assure the proposed power transfer design is safe and protects against fault propagation into either power system.  Boeing is the Technical systems manager for both the Space Shuttle power system (through the SFOC contract) and the ISS power system (through the ISS Vehicle sustaining contract), and as such has unique knowledge of not only the infividual power systems, but of the integrated system needs.  Additionally, Boeing has developed prototype power conversion systems meeting the integrated system needs using internal R&D funding.  This project also requires tight integration with the Auxiliary Power Conversion Unit (APCU), previously built and integrated to the Shuttle systems by the Boeing Company.  Additionally, the short delivery requirement for this system eliminates other potential sources due to the extensive learning curve required to become familiar with Shuttle and Station power system requirements and safety protections. The combination of factors puts the Boeing Company in position as the only responsible source for this integrated system.    The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. See note 22.   Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on November 15, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.   An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>The BCS-Mobile will be a theater asset that supports the Joint Force Commander (JFC)/ JFACC/Area Air Defense Commander requirement for tactical level air battle management.  This system will replace the AN/TYQ-23 Operations Module of the former Control and Reporting Centers.  It will support the Air Force Expeditionary Air Force (EAF) concept by creating a more deployable, tailorable theater C2 capability that will require less manpower to provide a persistent theater air control presence. It must accept, process, exploit, correlate and fuse data from multiple sensor/information sources and share it throughout the battlespace.  The BCS-M communications’ switch systems must be high capacity, compact, rugged, reliable, lightweight, and capable of rapid setup in austere environments.  The equipment will be multi-spectrum, media-independent, secure, and jam resistant.  It will be redundant, remotable, have a self-test capability, and degrade gracefully.  It will be capable of interfacing with both military and commercial communications systems and be RED/BLACK certified.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the University of Cincinnati Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Dr. Dan Oerther, to conduct Identification and Characterization of Microbial Communities with Warm Water Aquifers.  Required services include design and sampling of warm water aquifers in Arizona, California, and/or Nevada to identify and characterize microbial communtiies within warm aquifers and in the well bores and immediately adjacent areas of drinking water wells, with emphasis on Naegleria fowleri.  The contractor  shall design and carry out sampling protocols to ensure collection of water samples that represent aquifer conditions from the very long screened, multi-water bearing zone water supply wells common in the Western U.S and develop and use techniques that can distinguish "live" microorganisms rather  than just indicate the presence of DNA or RNA associated with cell fragments.  EPA believes that Dr. Oerther is uniquely qualified for this research in that he is the only researcher who has performed this type of research with environmental samples.  THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS.   However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting this EPA requirement may submit technical documentation to establish its assertion.  This documentation must be submitted to the POC within 15 days of the electronic posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed  requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the EPA.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  This acquisition is being processe  under FAR Part 13.  The anticipated award date is November 21, 2003.  See numbered note 26.

The base’s potable water system includes the following: 9 groundwater wells, chlorination and fluoridation equipment, 1 air stripper, 5 ground level storage tanks, 2 booster pump stations (BPS’s),  approximately 481,000 linear feet (91.1 miles) of piping, ranging in size from less than 2 inches to 30 inches in diameter, and 439 fire hydrants. Raw water is pumped from the groundwater wells via the BPS’s and the potable water storage tanks to the on-base distribution system. Chlorine is injected into the water from 150-pound (lb.) cylinders and hydrofluoristic acid is added through chemical feed pumps to fluoridate the water. The water pressure within the system varies by location from 30 to 90 pounds per square inch (psi). The potable water mains include lined and unlined cast iron pipe (CIP), asbestos cement pipe (ACP) and polyvinyl chloride pipe (PVC). Andersen AFB completed upgrading all the potable water distribution lines within the main base family housing areas during 2001; approximately 83,000 linear feet (17.3 percent of the total) of the potable water distribution system was replaced. In order to reduce and/or eliminate calcium carbonate scaling problems, Andersen AFB is considering the installation of sodium hexametaphosphate systems at the Tumon Maui Well and the Marbo Wells No’s 1, 2 and 3. 

The wastewater system at Andersen AFB collects and conveys on average 1.0 MGD of wastewater (sewage) to GWA’s system for treatment and disposal.

<SUBJECT>A -- Notice of Intent to Negotiate on Sole Source Basis for Extension of Contract 68-C-99-201 for On-site Laboratory Operations Support
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-C99201
<RESPDATE>110703
<ARCHDATE>11222003
<CONTACT>KATHLEEN ROE, CONTRACT SPECIALIST, Phone (513)487-2144, Fax (513)487-2109, Email ROE.KATHLEEN@EPA.GOV
<DESC>The U.S. EPA, National Risk Management Research Laboratory (NRMRL), Air Pollution Prevention and Control Division (APPCD) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with ARCADIS, Geraghty & Miller under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1 for a 3-month extension period  under Contract 68-C-99-201 for on-site laboratory support services pending award of a  follow-on contract.  The current contract is scheduled to expire on 11/30/03.  It is expected that a follow-on contract will be awarded in February, 2004 as a result of Solicitation No. PR-CI-03-10355.

During this period, the contractor shall operate pilot plants and full scale equipment to characterize emissions and to develop and evaluate control and pollution prevention technologies; conduct sampling and process monitoring of bench-, pilot-, and full-scale processes at RTP and field sites up to and including 24 hours per day; and operate various on-site analytical laboratories to prepare and evaluate samples collected.  The contractor shall design experiments, operate, maintain, and repair equipment, evaluate data from experiments, and prepare and present reports on the work.  The contractor shall operate a RCRA permitted hazardous waste incineration laboratory. 

ARCADIS Geraghty & Miller is uniquely qualified to meet EPA's requirement during the 3-month extension period based on its research expertise, knowledge of the facility equipment, familiarity with the data for on-going projects, and its capability to meet EPA’s critical deadlines.  APPCD’s research and development responsibility is for providing data on mercury control, fine particulate matter control, optical remote sensing technologies, trace pollutant characterization and indoor air quality, including Homeland Security studies of safe buildings.  In all of these highly sensitive areas, APPCD has studies ongoing that will ultimately be input to regulations to be promulgated by various EPA program offices.

Critical at this time is the eminent court mandated publication of a rule on mercury emissions by December 15, 2003.  Work assignments in process toward this effort include:  development of data on characterization of mercury in coal combustion residues; field evaluation of mercury continuous emission monitors; development of multi-pollutant mercury control technologies; characterization of mercury in the U. S. crude oil supply;  measurement of mercury in landfill gas; and speciation of mercury in coal-fired boilers.  For fine particulate matter control, on-going work assignments include:  evaluation of fine PM generation from prescribed burning of forests; speciation of metal particles in combustion processes; characterization of heavy-duty diesel emissions; and sampling support to PM health effects studies.  Most of these particle studies were requested by the Office of Air and Radiation, and will ultimately serve as the basis for regulations on fine particulate emissions.

All of the research mentioned above is now, and has been for the past ten years, supported by ARCADIS, which has developed critical expertise in the areas being researched.  ARCADIS not only possesses critically important expertise on these highly important research areas, but it also possesses critical expertise in the operation of APPCD’s research facilities.  APPCD possesses a collection of one-of-a-kind research equipment, many of which have been fabricated by ARCADIS and refined as needed by them.  Its combination of research expertise, knowledge of the research equipment, and familiarity with the data for critical on-going projects places it in the position of being the only responsible contractor capable of EPA’s critical deadlines during the three-month period from December to February.     

This notice is not a request for proposals. However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA requirements may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the statement of work.  Such documentation must be submitted to the POC within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.

This action is being processed under FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation.  The applicable NAICS code is 541710.  The anticipated award date is 11/25/02.  See Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), NIH MRI Research Facility (NMRF) intends to procure on a sole-source basis with Invivo Research Inc., 12601 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826 for the purchase of a Magnitude MRI patient vital signs monitoring system.   The In Vivo NMR Research Center is a service center for the scientific community to work towards the advancement of In Vivo NMR technology, its application to animal physiology, and ultimately, its application in the clinical setting.  The magnitude MRI patient vital signs monitoring system will be used in a strong magnetic field and must be an MRI compatible physiological monitoring system. The current physiological monitoring system that we use in the NMR center does not meet the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations  (JCAHO) requirements.  A system with an independent power supply so that electrical power loss will not compromise the care of patients being monitored while under general anesthesia is required.   The current system does not have battery backup and must be replaced because of the new requirements being mandated by JCAHO.  The NMR center has several MRI research projects on children who are medically unstable and require MRI scans, which must be done under sedation. The In Vivo system has cardiac gating capabilities when used with ultra fast perfusion sequences.  The National Institute of Heart Lung and Blood did research within the NMR Research center and found that the QRS complex, (electrical signals related to the contraction phase of the ventricle) which is necessary for cardiac gated studies, is superior with the In Vivo system.  This is a research facility that uses ultra fast sequences for heart and brain perfusion studies.  The system must be able to perform reliable cardiac gating wave patterns with the ultra fast sequences when scanning with MRI pulse sequences. The physiological monitoring system will be used in a state of the art high field strength magnet room.  Ultra fast MRI sequences are used for patient studies and require a system, which will not fail to produce diagnostic images on patients.  The In Vivo magnitude MRI patient vital signs monitoring system is the only piece of equipment known to the  researcher that meets the above requirements.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet all of the above requirements, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 – Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1PM EST (local Washington, D.C. time) on October 29, 2003.  All questions must be in writing and may be emailed to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.  It is the vendors responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 and verify that questions were received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted.  NAICS: 334516

This requirement was previously advertised in FedBizOps on 03 September 2003 under combined synopsis/solicitation N00421-03-R-0134, as withdrawn by notice in the FedBizOps dated 11 September 2003.  Previous respondents to that notice are required to request and respond to this notice and/or solicitation to be considered.  A contract with firm fixed price line items, cost reimbursement line items, and line items with fixed hourly rates is contemplated using full and open competition as the procurement method.  Firm requirements for two U-6 aircraft are known; options for one U-1 and one U-6 are planned.  The effort will include refurbishing the aircraft per current applicable DeHavilland Manuals, Maintenance Manuals, Repair Manuals, Service Bulletins, Engineering Bulletins, Technical News Sheets, and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Airworthiness Directives, and using Federal Aviation Regulations, Part 43 Maintenance and Inspections, and Part 91 General Operating Rules to establish and clarify standards.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U.S. Army TACOM-ARDEC is contemplating award of a sole source purchase order to Indiana Ordnance Works, 11452 Highway 62, Charlestown, IN 47111 to  procure full-scale inert M231 and M232 Training Aids that contain sectioned  M231 and M232 charges in their corresponding sectioned metal ammo storage  containers. The 155mm M231/M232 propelling charges known as MACS (Modular  Artillery Charge System) are two different propelling charges designed and  developed at Picatinny Arsenal, that provide a complete zoning solution for  155MM Artillery applications by using multiples of a basic increment. During development and fielding of the MACS charge, the U.S. Army TACOM-ARDEC  has previously contracted for the creation of full-scale displays and reduced-scale training aids of the MACS to illustrate charge construction,  packaging and field application. The M231 charges are used at lower zones  (Zones 1 & 2), while the M232 Charges are used at higher zones (Zones 3 through 6). The training aids include producing thirty (30) M231 and thirty  (30) M232 Packaged Cutaways that are displayed in their metal ammunition  storage container.  Since soldiers will be training with these cutaways, it is important that they are of the same quality and construction as the “live” version while using inert materials.  The MACS and their components are on the Militarily Critical Technologies List (MCTL), Aug 1996. Therefore, the MACS TDP is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act Title 22, U.S.C. Sec 2751) and is subject to DoD Directives 5230.24 and  5230.25. See numbered notes 8.

<DESC>THIS IS AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION NUMBER
BBGCON0304S5417-KSH POSTED ON OCTOBER 10, 2003 FOR R -- ADMINISTRATIVE
MANAGEMENT SUPPORT SERVICES FOR VOA TV.  Question 1- The deliverables
for the contract are very open.  They do not specify length or extent of
reports, exact time expectations, time segments for deliverables, or a
timetable other than the one-year life of the contract.  Our impression
is the IBB wants a plan laid out as part of this solicitation to
accomplish the goals it has set out.  Is that a correct assumption and,
if so, are we free to propose a contract time commitment or would the
Board like that open throughout the one-year life of the contract?
Answer 1- See Paragraph 2. Delivery Schedule: The time for submission
for the contract deliverables will be 30 to 45 days after each
individual task is assigned by the IBB/VOA Director or his
representative.  Question 2- This solicitation does not call for a line
item budget, expense expectations, etc.  Are we to assume the award be a
flat fee to include all fees of all kinds or does the board want some
kind of line item budget with this proposal?  Also, would we as a
contractor be subject to any regulations as to the how our expenses can
be spent, such as only flying American Flag carriers, etc.? Answer 2 -
Each CLIN shall be priced separately, however when combined, will result
in a total firm fixed price for the entire project.  In accordance with
paragraph (ix) The Government will award a firm-fixed price (FFP)
contract to the responsible offeror whos offer conforms to the RFP and
will be most advantageous to the Government, based on price, past
performance and other factors in the solicitation.  All cost associated
with meeting the requirement of this solicitation, including any related
travel cost shall be included as part of Contractor's firm-fixed price. 
Question 3 - Along those lines, the proposal describes monthly payments
after receipt of invoice.  Does this mean the contract amount divided by
12 invoices or does this mean segments or deliverables submitted as they
occur?  Would we invoice for that when it occurs, or would we invoice
for a twelfth of the whole contract amount that month and every month? 
Answer 3 - Invoices are to be submitted monthly for costs that have
incurred and that have been accepted by the BBG during the invoice
period.  

PROPOSALS ARE DUE AT THE BROADCASTING BOARD OF GOVERNORS, INTERNATIONAL

<DESC>The following is the Government’s response to questions regarding the above referenced solicitation.

Question 1.  The RFP specifies “top-level” coverage of each DHS mission area.  Please comment further on the depth of coverage.  In terms of the news topics included, and the sources to be used, will the human news editors deliver (a) exhaustive coverage all news stories of interest to officials within each mission area, even if a number of these stories do not rise to the level of DHS-wide interest, or (b) a broad briefing covering all DHS mission areas, but intentionally culled of lower-priority news stories?  Or is there a better way to convey the level of depth required?

Government’s Response:  This requirement is for only “top-level” coverage which includes all articles concerning the Department of Homeland Security.  This includes all major newspapers, local area coverage, the wire services, international newspapers such as the financial times, and national and local television coverage. 

Question 2.  The RFP requires inclusion of “the full-length version of news articles outlined in the news summary.”  Is it sufficient to provide within the summary briefing document a hypertext link which connects directly to each full-length article appearing on the Internet? 

Government’s Response.  Yes.  Within the clips package, a hypertext link shall be provided to the full-text version of news articles outlined in the news summaries.

Question 3.  Section 508 Accessibility Standards.  The service as described would be text based and would be viewed on the IP-protected Web site and delivered to DHS in electronic format (MSWord) for on-site printing to hard copy.  Can you envision a scenario in which the vendor would be required to do more than this in order to comply with 508?  If so, what might the vendor be required to do?

Government’s Response.  No.  The contractor is only required to comply with the Section 508 Accessibilities Standards at (www.section508.gov).

Question 4.  The solicitation requires the creation of an IP-protected web site.  Do you have a standard for which web programming language should be used to accomplish this IP protection (Perl, ASP, Cold Fusion, ...)?  If not, can the contractor choose which language to use?

Government’s Response.  No, not at this time.  The contractor can choose the language to use for this requirement.

Question 5.  Will the contractor be required to both create and host (that is, provide a computer as a web server) the IP-protected web site or will the contractor only be required only to build the site?

Government’s Response.  Yes.  This requirement is to create and host the IP-protected web site.

Question 6.  The solicitation stipulates that the web site will maintain a 30+ day archive. Should this say "31 day" or "one month" archive?

Government’s Response.  No.  A 30+ archive means that it will carry anywhere from a 30 day archive and more.  The minimum requirement is 30 days.  However, there is no stipulation on the maximum days of the archive. 

Question 7.  The solicitation stipulates "The summary brief shall be sent electronically in a compatible format (MS Word) Monday through Friday (except Federal holidays), by 7 a.m., to five DHS personnel."  Because MS Word can become infected with a VB-based worm or virus, would you consider another format (e.g., Adobe Acrobat)?

Government’s Response.  MS Word is the minimum requirement.  However, another format in addition to MS Word would be considered.

Question 8.  The solicitation requires that the briefings be delivered daily by 7:00 a.m. (EST) on each federal workday, Monday through Friday.  Is electronic delivery sufficient?

Government’s Response.  The summary brief is to be provided electronically and on the website daily by 7:00 a.m. (EST).  
 
Question 9.  The RFP requires coverage of local television and other media sources. Please clarify what is intended by 'local' or the scope

In order to preserve the fairness of the procurement process, the bid opening date is hereby extended to Thursday August 21 at 2:00 PM local time in Syracuse, NY.  A formal Standard Form 30 solicitation amendment will be posted to this website once the necessary computer systems are fully restored.

7.	PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:	USAID/CENTRAL ASIA, Almaty, Kazakhstan with regional travel both in-country and throughout the Central Asia Region (CAR) i.e., Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan
8.	JOB DESCRIPTION:

A.	BACKGROUND

USAID/CAR Background: USAID/CAR is responsible, in close consultation with the five U.S. ambassadors in the region, for the design, development and management of assistance programs in five republics.  The central office is located in Almaty, Kazakhstan with offices in Tashkent, Uzbekistan; Bishkek and Osh, Kyrgyzstan; Ashgabat, Turkmenistan; and Dushanbe, Tajikistan.  USAID is one of the Agency’s largest Missions responsible for approximately $100 million of assistance annually, with activities in the areas of energy and natural resources, economics and finance, democracy and media, and health and humanitarian assistance.  The Mission works in partnership with over 80 grantee and contractor teams.  USAID/CAR’s assistance seeks to mitigate conflict and expand opportunities for participation, livelihood and quality of life for the citizens of the Central Asian Republics.  Staff frequently travels to each of the five countries to manage and monitor development assistance. 
 
Recognizing the importance of the CAR natural resource base, and the historic mismanagement of those resources, in fostering the emergence of a competitive, market-oriented economy, USAID/CAR established a strategic objective (SO) to introduce the integrated management of natural resources in the region. Specifically, SO 1.6 “Improved management of critical natural resources, including energy” covers the FY2000 to FY2005 period.  Success under this SO, as defined in the USAID/CAR strategic plan, is “successful models of integrated resource management adopted and applied”.  Strategy components consist of: a) broad training in environmental and natural resource management, including the development of pilot demonstrations; b) improved policy and regulatory framework; and, c) the establishment of a greater awareness of environmental and natural resource issues among the public.  

In Central Asia, the agricultural sector plays a vital social and economic role. Sixty per cent of Central Asians live in rural areas, and agriculture contributes to approximately 30% of the countries’ GDP. These numbers are even higher in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. Food security is of particular concern in Tajikistan. Recent developments indicate there is a loosening up of strong government control of the agriculture sector in the areas of land policy, farmer privatization, credit and marketing policies.  This liberalization of the sector creates opportunities for new assistance programs.

Within USAID/CAR, the Office of Energy and Water (EW) has the primary responsibility for all energy (oil, gas, electric power) and water resources, including water activities, several of which are related to agriculture.  These include irrigation infrastructure rehabilitation, improving the planning and allocation of irrigation water, communication upgrades and related training. The office also serves as USAID/CAR’s contact point for various agricultural activities including the Agency-funded Farmer to Farmer Program, a centrally-funded Collaborative Research Support Program (CRSP) in support of Livestock, and activities with the Israeli International Development Agency (MASHAV).  EW is about to enlarge its agricultural activities, especially in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, and perhaps Kyrgyzstan.  EW is the primary USAID/CAR point of communication and coordination for all energy, water and most aspects of agricultural development with the governments of the five Central Asian republics, the respective U.S. Embassies, local and international NGOs, other local donors, and private commercial entities. 

The other technical office of the Mission implementing programs dealing with agriculture is the Office of Enterprise and Finance (EF).  Activities include providing business training to assist entrepreneurs (several of whom are agribusinesses), with planning, accounting, marketing and other aspects of successful business development.  EF also funds agricultural consulting services in the region through an agreement with MASHAV, the Israeli Development Agency, and assistance to the agricultural input industry in Kyrgyzstan. An expanded land policy activity is about to be extended from Kyrgyzstan to both Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.  EF has a focused program of agribusiness development in the Osh region of Southern Kyrgyzstan.

In Tajikistan, the Mission has funded several grants to organizations to do agricultural activities such as Water User and Private Farmer Association development, farmer training and crop improvements.  These tend to be smaller activities focused in one area of the country.

B.  STATEMENT OF DUTIES

Basic Function of the Position: 

The Agriculture Development Specialist will provide project management, and serve as the Mission specialist, for agriculturally related activities throughout CAR. This includes identifying, analyzing, and implementing sector programs and activities; identifying key policy constraints to improved agricultural development; formulating, quantifying and tracking results and performance indicators; and providing guidance to contractors, grantees, the public sector, and PVO and NGO implementing partners.

He/she will give recommendations and help develop new activities for the EW office, as well as evaluate ongoing Mission programs, including other technical offices when appropriate.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) to locate potential sources for a Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) web-monitoring tool for the Farm Service Agency (FSA) an agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). 

The FSA seeks information on a web-monitoring agent that can be installed on web application hosting servers to allow real or near real time monitoring of performance data by application and by server instance.  The tool shall provide notification (via e-mail, paging, visual alarms – including web-based remote monitoring -- and audio alarms) if service availability has decreased below 98% or response time exceeds a threshold time (e.g., 3 seconds).  This commercial product will provide FSA and/or USDA with direct access to the charts showing history trend analyses, response times, hits, transaction loads and summaries of the critical aspects of daily web hosting operational status. 
The software will provide a diagnostic tool to pinpoint potential and actual areas of customer service failures.  The areas of greatest interest are the definition and measurement of units of work; response time monitoring; monitoring resource usage by applications, such as I/O and CPU statistics and applications’ layer network resource usage; facilities for controlling applications, such as stopping, suspending, resuming, restarting and reconfiguring applications; and external factors to include traffic congestion, delays, redirects, connection failures, ISP problems, poor peering relationships, line noise, and issues resulting in network congestion, latency, packet losses, and connectivity issues.

The Web Farm primarily uses Windows IIS, Websphere 5.0, DB2 8.1.3 and SQL Server PC-based application hosting with supporting (back end) Unix database Platforms. The Web Hosting PC platform uses Windows NT and Windows 2000 Server & Advanced Server operating systems. The UNIX-type operating systems currently include IBM AIX and SUN operating systems. Applications are written using: C, C++, Microsoft Visual Basic, Microsoft Visual Interdev, Websphere Studio (WSAD-Eclipse), PowerBuilder, PERL, Microsoft ActiveX, Java, and CGI scripting languages. The databases supporting these applications are Sybase 11.02, Microsoft SQL 6.5 and 7.0, Informix 7.0, DB2 8.1.3, and Oracle 8.5.

The product must provide the capability to alert FSA in multiple modes when the website becomes inaccessible, and or returns incorrect data.  These modes are to include (but not be limited to) e-mail, browser, visual, audio (phone) and pager.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is the federal entity charged with the enforcement of the immigration laws and regulations of the United States of America. This Request For Information is for the support of the ICE Forensic Document Laboratory (FDL) to replace their current Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) developed using Lotus Notes with a fully integrated Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) LIMS. 

To facilitate this effort, the General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Technology Service (FEDSIM) is seeking highly qualified suppliers of COTS LIMS for configuration, customization, installation, data conversion, training, and help desk support of the COTS software.  

The FDL provides scientific examination of questioned documents and intelligence support services to ICE field offices worldwide, and to other Federal, State, local and foreign government entities in joint operations and/or when immigration fraud is suspected. The FDL has approximately 52 staff members assigned to its McLean, Virginia facility where the COTS LIMS will be installed. The staff consists of Intelligence Officers, Forensic Document Examiners, Fingerprint Examiners, Examiner Trainees and administrative/support personnel.  

The FDL wants to replace the current LIMS with a system that:
1.	Provides single data entry that automatically populates other data fields and remembers pertinent and relevant data as the user navigates the LIMS system, so that the data does not have to be re-entered, selected or searched for;
2.	Provides an intuitive, user friendly, graphical user interface (GUI), consistent with that of Microsoft products (e.g. Internet Explorer, Word, Excel, Powerpoint, and Windows Media Player). 
3.	Captures data from all laboratory processes, ensuring uniformity of statistical reporting, and electronic data sharing with submitters and other designated users of the data; 
4.	Provides common print support for Microsoft and Novel network operating systems (NOS); 
5.	Can be easily and efficiently modified to meet lab growth and changing business needs;
6.	Displays Individual Examiner workload/productivity in a consolidated view with drill down to detail data;
7.	Provides persistent auditing capabilities;
8.	Provides data archival and retention capabilities;
9.	Is user friendly, utilizes fewer and more standardized data input points, and enhanced and easier individual workload tracking;
10.	Facilitates sharing of information with other Federal law enforcement agencies that use Oracle or equivalent database architecture;
11.	Is built upon a COTS relational database management system (e.g. Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle 8i or IBM DB2);
12.	Can be implemented using mass storage devices such as a Storage Area Network (SAN) or Network Attached Storage (NAS);
13.	Can meet the Government requirements for handling classified information and documents;
14.	Can be integrated with MS Exchange services; and
15.	Can be certified at SW-CMM L-2 or greater (http://www.sei.cmu.edu/cmm/).

In addition, the LIMS must provide complete, accurate, and timely processing and tracking of document and other evidence, reports and statistical information.  
The following functions will be supported by LIMS: 
(1)	Submission of requests for forensic examination electronically via e-mail, the FDL Intranet, or FTP server;
(2)	Automated, limited remote access to database for case status inquiries and to view case reports;
(3)	Analysis of document and fingerprint evidence; 
(4)	Automated chain of custody for all items of evidence;
(5)	Automated Laboratory Reports of Findings and other written documents;
(6)	Support for expert witness testimony in courts of law and other judicial proceedings;
(7)	Analysis of evidence in support of intelligence activities, including dissemination of document intelligence, document analysis, and other technical information to the law enforcement community;
(8)	Photographic services, in both film and digital formats, to support forensic and intelligence services;
(9)	Other forensic services in support of enforcement and intelligence operations;
(10)	 Analysis of laboratory operations to support resource planning, productivity projections, workload distribution, and work scheduling;
(11)	 Lab instrument interfaces to capture instrument readings directly in LIMS;
(12)	 Production of automated individual and aggregate workload and productivity reports on all operational (forensic and intelligence support) and administrative activities;
(13)	 Full database keyword and field search capability;
(14)	 Automated consolidated routine productivity reports, aggregated by groups – forensic, intelligence, administration;
(15)	 Data collection on meeting forensic case requestors’ case return deadlines;
(16)	 Tracking inventory of destroyed files;
(17)	 Tracking requirements and documenting compliance with accreditation standards of The American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors (ASCLD); and 
(18)	 File sharing facilities with participating agencies.  

Suppliers having these capabilities are encouraged to respond to this RFI by electronically submitting their responses to chuck.shelton@gsa.gov on or before 11:00 AM EST, 7 November, 2003.  Responses shall include product literature and references to current products and installations meeting the specific qualifications detailed in this RFI.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
              AIR FORCE MEDIATION AND SUPPORT SERVICES

                      Reference # F49642-03-R-XXXX

The Air Force Alternative Dispute Resolution Program (www.adr.af.mil) is requesting information for a potential acquisition to acquire dispute resolution services and support in several functional areas, at locations across the continental United States. The potential acquisition would be for approximately 100 mediation or mentoring sessions per year and ADR functional support.  Currently, Air Force military and civilian employees perform these services in conjunction with a Government contractor.

The overall purpose of the ADR Program is to promote the use of alternative dispute resolution techniques and processes to resolve disputes in appropriate cases. The Air Force recognizes the benefits in time and cost savings/avoidance through these measures as well as the intangible benefits received when disputes are settled in a faster, more appropriate, more amiable process than the traditional administrative or adjudicative options.

The Air Force seeks to promote the use of ADR to resolve disputes in which the Air Force is a party. To do so, its personnel must be made aware of what ADR is, what it offers them, how to initiate its use, how the different processes work, and which one(s) are appropriate for their situation. Furthermore, the Air Force seeks to train its personnel to screen cases for ADR, use as well as actually use the techniques and conduct the processes. While the Air Force educates its personnel about ADR and trains its people to conduct these processes, there is also a need to assist the Major Commands (MAJCOMs) in tailoring the overall program to meet their command specific requirements. This effort also requires a marketing effort to encourage all Air Force personnel at every level to consider using ADR to resolve their disputes should the need arise. 

Types of workplace disputes requiring mediation, mediation mentoring, and third party neutral services include the following:

Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Complaints,
Agency Grievances (AGS), 
Negotiated Grievances (NGS), 
Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) Complaints, 
Merit System Protection Board (MSPB) cases, and 
Disputes between Military Members deemed appropriate for resolution through the ADR process IAW AFI 36-2706 (as amended). 

The Air Force Alternative Dispute Resolution Program is divided into three functional areas: Management and Administration Support Services, ADR Program Support, and ADR Program Website. 

Request contractors interested and capable of performing these functions submit the following information: name and address of company, company point of contact, telephone number, fax number and email addresses, identify business size (small, disadvantage, HUBZone, women owned, 8(a), etc.) and identify if you are a GSA schedule holder. For purposes of this Request For Information (RFI), the SIC Code is 8741 and the corresponding NAICS code is 56111. The capability package must be clear, concise, complete, and submitted to the contracting office no later than 14 March 2003. Please limit the capability package to 25 pages. The packages can be submitted by US mail, e-mail or fax.

Your statement of capabilities must include, as a minimum, the following items: 1) Contract references in the past five years relevant to the requirement to include: contract number, agency supported, whether or not you were a prime or subcontractor, period of performance, original contract value, final or current contract value, technical monitor and phone/fax number, POC with current phone/fax number, and a brief description of the effort. 2) Company profile: number of employees, annual sales history, locations, and if CCR registered. 3) Your company?s ability to provide services in all three ADR Program functional areas.

Please indicate your company?s ability to provide ADR Program services and support in each functional area. Please indicate information in the following format: 

1) Management and Administration Services
a. Workplace mediation mentoring based on the Air Force standard mediation model 
b. Workplace mediation based on the Air Force standard mediation model 
c. Third party neutral services based on the Air Force standard mediation model
	d. ADR training courses as listed
	e. Management and administrative support services for the ADR Program

2) ADR Program Support
	a. Conference participation
	b. ADR systems designs workshops
	c. Air Force personnel and commander briefings
	d. ADR marketing and education products/materials
	e. ADR Newsletter
	f. Logistical support for conferences, seminars, and training sessions
	
3) ADR Program Website (www.adr.af.mil)
NOTE: All website content must be compliant with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act as of 12-31-01.
	a. Programming and technical support
b. Restructuring and technical support
c. Designing, updating/upgrading, and maintenance
	

This is a request for information only, to support market research and help define potential course of action for the Air Force Alternative Dispute Resolution Program. The Government is under no obligation to and will not pay for any costs associated with submission of the capability packages, nor is the Government committed to issuance of a solicitation.

<DESC>The Government intends to award on a full and open competition basis the requirement for the purchase of a pulsed femtosecond (fs) laser to expand  our current capabilities in manufacturing research.  It will be used to explore behavior of early stage energetic reactions, possible new energetic systems and support of future biomedical and material science and engineering research.  The system must allow for future expanion and begin with the  purchase of two components.  The first is a base unit that provides a pulse of less than 100 fs with a peak power of approximately 0.1 TeraWatt.  The second component should expand the tunable wavelength response to the 189nm - 2600nm range.  An example would be a 0.1 TeraWatt peak power that would be coupled to an appropriate tuning system such as titanium doped sapphire. Future additions will include an amplifier to boost peak power to greater than 1 TerraWatt.  Interested parties should submit their capabilities  electronically to ckallis@pica.army.mil no later than the close of business 1600pm est.

<DESC>Dear Valued Contractor
     
We are excited to announce that we are finally able to offer you the opportunity to join us in the deployment of Wide Area Work Flow Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA).  

WAWF-RA is designed to automate Commercial Invoices and Government Receiving Reports in a web based, paperless environment.  WAWF-RA electronically captures and coordinates the four basic pieces of our payment process.  WAWA-RA users input their invoices and receiving reports via the Internet, and are compared to contracts stored in the Defense Finance Accounting System (DFAS) - Electronic Document Access (EDA) system. Once the invoice and receiving reports are approved and processed, payment transactions are initiated via Electronic File Protocol (EFT) to the contractor’s bank account.  DCMA at various locations (see below) has arranged to provide training to Contractor users of the new system.  They respectfully request you and/or your representative plan to attend one of these training sessions to be conducted at Comp USA sites.   You will need to contact the CompUSA Classroom POC identified on attached schedule in your geographic area to reserve a space for the training.  Additional training is available on-line at <https://skyraider.slidell.disa.mil> (About WAWF-RA).

There are no costs involved, registration and software are all provided FREE of charge and DCMA team will be there every step of the way if you need assistance.

JOB DESCRIPTION	:

A.	BACKGROUND

USAID/Philippines has recently received USAID/Washington approval for a new Strategic Objective (SO) for education for 2004-2009.  The new SO was approved as an addition to the current Mission strategy for 1999-2004, but will be carried into a new strategy being developed for 2005-2009.  (Information on the current strategy can be obtained from the website http://www.usaid-ph.gov.)  Relative to the current strategy, ongoing discussions for developing the new strategy indicate that the new strategy most likely will refine and update three existing SOs on economic governance, family planning and health, and environment and energy, expand the Mindanao conflict SO to cover other conflict-affected areas, and continue implementation of the recently approved SO for education.

The Philippines education system was once one of the best in all of Asia.  However, the system has deteriorated drastically over the last generation in both quality and access.  Key comparative advantages are eroding.  President Arroyo and education analysts have raised concern about the decline in English language competency and general academic performance among Philippines graduates.  It has also been noted that English language competency is directly related to the economic health of the nation as many Filipinos work overseas and provide remittances.  There is also recognition of the need for teacher training in all subject matter with particular emphasis on information and communications technology (ICT).  The President, to address the decline in educational performance, has required that math and science return to English as the language of instruction.  

The situation is most acute in Mindanao and within the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) in particular.  The ARMM remains the poorest area of the Philippines and has correspondingly low social indicators.  The quality of education is typically poor. 

Improved access to quality education is widely seen by the Filipino people as a means to a better life.  It can play an important role in helping Muslim Filipinos become more effective players in the country¡¦s pluralistic and democratic state.  Increased access to education will help address alienation of the Muslim population, and help them see a better future as part of the Philippine state.  Improved education will help level the playing field and reduce marginalization of this population to enable them to compete for employment opportunities and participate more fully in economic growth.  

USAID/Philippines new education program intends to improve access to, and the quality of, education. Efforts will focus particularly on reducing the differences between education opportunities in Mindanao, especially the ARMM and other conflict-affected areas, and the rest of the nation.  This will include helping to prepare the next generation of Muslim leaders, professionals and decision-makers, and which will require higher education training as well.  The program also will address the special problems of out-of-work youth in the conflict-affected areas. It will help address systemic weaknesses, including corruption in the provision of goods and services.  Activities will include: (1) expanding and improving community-based learning activities in both formal and non-formal education sectors; (2) enhancing capacity for teaching math, science and English; (3) improving education sector policies at the local and national levels; and (4) reintegrating out-of-school youth in conflict-affected areas of Mindanao.  USAID/Philippines will implement this program through local partners in collaboration with a U.S. Government (USG) interagency working group including the U.S. Embassy Public Affairs Service (PAS) and the Peace Corps (PC), and other donors.  USAID will also encourage U.S. and Philippine private sector groups involved in education through corporate social responsibility programs to play an important role by engaging in productive partnerships. USAID will also incorporate other efforts already underway.   

Under the Growth with Equity in Mindanao - 2 Program (GEM-2), USAID/Philippines has started activities in education in the ARMM that are already producing encouraging results.  The supported programs aim to (a) increase community awareness of major education problems in the ARMM; (b) help various groups (i.e., parents¡¦ groups, business organizations) improve schools; (c) build the educational planning and analysis capacity of the ARMM Department of Education; (d) improve the English language skills of both school children and the general public; (e) increase computer literacy and internet access in selected schools; and (f) provide selected interventions in key vocational institutions.  GEM-2 is also supporting an internship program for some 15-20 recent graduates of ARMM colleges and universities who will spend some 4-6 months each working as interns in the Philippines House of Representatives.  The Program aims to help the interns develop a greater understanding of the role of Congress in shaping the economic development of the Philippines, and thus play a key role in USAID¡¦s attempts to improve both governance and education in the ARMM.  The new education SO will incorporate these promising activities into the new programs, including possibly replicating successful interventions in other conflict-affected and/or disadvantaged areas of the Philippines.    

As part of the Education SO, USAID/Philippines also recently signed an agreement with the Peace Corps for a Pilot Education Assistance Program. The Program, which will benefit the conflict-affected areas in Mindanao, is designed to enhance the capacity of Mindanao¡¦s public school teachers, instructional staff and student teachers.  The program will provide training for them in English education, Internet and Communication Technologies (ICT) and content-based instruction methodologies and techniques in Math, Science, Health and Environment to enhance their lesson-planning and classroom skills.  

Development of activities under the new education strategy will require extensive collaborative analyses and planning, creativity and innovation, discussions and negotiations with the Government of the Republic of the Philippines (GRP), the ARMM government, as well as with the other major donors in education, given USAID¡¦s newer substantive involvement in this sector.  The emphasis on public-private sector partnerships also requires significant similar engagement with local and international corporate philanthropic organizations, and NGOs.
