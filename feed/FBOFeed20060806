<DESC>Answers to questions for Request for Proposal for the Lightweight and Industrial Dry Suits

QUESTION 1:  I have read section 52.212-5 of the solicitation and noted in particular the Buy America Act is included.  However, it is not stated in the solicitation if the Berry Amendment applies should a component not be available domestically.
