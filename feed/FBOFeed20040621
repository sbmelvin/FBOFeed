<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration hereby makes notice of a proposed contract action under solicitation number 223-04-2507, “Food Source Identification and Tracking System”, for the following:

(1) A predictive modeling tool that is capable of generating various permutations (simulations) to food safety emergencies (both unintentional and intentional). It will be based upon the complex systems involved in food production. This modeling tool should be able to project outcomes and their probabilities in terms of the likely distribution of human illness or death and economic consequences, based on assumptions about the underlying food adulteration event before its true nature is known. These assumptions should easily accommodate modifications. Events to be modeled will need to be able to incorporate different methods of intervention, times of intervention, and points in the food production and distribution chain at which the intervention is applied. This tool will be based upon complex systems predictive (mathematical) modeling that does not require real-time network connectivity or inputs and will tool serve as a predictive modeling instrument and not an IT system. The mathematical substructure of the tool may be based upon a tool (theory) already in existence (and modified as needed).  

(2) Identification of the data requirements constitutes an essential part of supporting such a predictive modeling tool. Once the modeling tool is conceptualized and designed, it is important that its data requirements be described and a determination made as to the feasibility of how these requirements can be met. It should be determined if existing data sources are available and can be made accessible to support the modeling tool. It should be determined if additional data sources will need to be articulated and developed. Conceivably, such data requirements may include a mechanism for enhancing industry’s and FDA’s ability to trace foods through the entire food chain, especially when food is suspected/implicated as the intentional or accidental vehicle for the transmission of a human pathogen or a toxic material.  Development of such a tool and the utilization of such data will facilitate a rapid and effective response by government and industry to an intentional or unintentional food safety emergency so illness, death, and economic impact are minimized. Data needs and requirements in any predictive modeling tool, as in this one, are dynamic over time. This fluidity should be taken into consideration during data needs assessment and reporting. 

(3) The ability to easily incorporate data into tool, modify data in tool, or change data in tool is required to fully utilize this tool. This step is dependent upon both previous steps and should be planned accordingly. As data is identified, a plan will be developed for this incorporation or use, depending upon need and data structure.

THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION/REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP). The solicitation will be available on the FedBizOpps web page at http://www.fedbizopps.gov for downloading on or about fifteen (15) calendar days after publication of this announcement with proposals due approximately 30 calendar days later. THE SOLICITATION WILL BE SET ASIDE FOR COMPETITION AMONG SMALL BUSINESSES. Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the solicitation, attachments and amendments. It is the offeror’s responsibility to monitor the FedBizopps web page for the release of the solicitation and any amendments. Hard copies will be provided to individuals eligible under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act upon request. Award is anticipated mid- to late September, 2004 or sooner.

<DESC>Description:  The Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Agency (DOE/NNSA), Training and Development Division (T&DD) in Albuquerque issued a Request for Information(DE-RI52-04NA77131) on May 17, 2004.  Based on industry response to this RFI, DOE/NNSA intends, under 41 USC 253 c (1) one responsible source, to enter into an agreement on a sole-source basis with Dianas Homegrown, 181-A N.W. Frontage Rd., Lemitar, NM 87823. The agreement will be for the operation of cafeteria/snack bar and catering services on-site at the Energy Training Complex  (ETC) located at 1401 Maxwell Street, Kirtland Air Force Base West, Albuquerque, NM 87118. The ETC is located within a secure military compound; therefore, only authorized personnel may gain entry.  It is anticipated that a five-year memorandum of agreement will be issued, where the vendors compensation will consist of receipts less cost of goods sold expenses (including payroll, taxes, supplies etc.).  The ETC has 13,000 square feet of dedicated training space (13 classrooms), and can accommodate up to 700 students at any given time.  Based on historical information, an average of 2,500 to 3,000 individuals per month utilize the cafeteria/snack bar services. It is anticipated that a minimum of 20%-to 30% may elect to eat at the cafeteria/snack bar for breakfast or lunch.  It is possible, but not guaranteed that this number could increase, as the vendor will be allowed to market and advertise their services, subject to prior government approval.  The service required will include breakfast, lunch and the provision of ready-to-eat items/snacks, such as yogurt, chips, fresh fruit, etc., and hot/cold beverages available at all times.  The hours of operation for the cafeteria/snack bar are 7:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Monday through Thursday and 7:30 to 1:00 on Friday.  Catering will be on an as needed basis for classes and seminars.  Normally, the vendor will be the exclusive catering provider. However, due to the fact that federal appropriations cannot be used for food, refreshments, etc., there are a few occasions (historically these have been less than 10 requests per year, which is minimal), on a case-by-case basis, where Federal ONLY employees may request a waiver for catering services and bring in their own food/refreshments.  All requests for waiver must be made to and approved by the Training Administration Program Manager in advance. There are approximately 800 classes/seminars/meetings a year with approximately 35,000 attendees annually.  The average length of these classes/seminars/meetings varies.  Most classes/seminars are at least two days in length and meeting usually range from one to two full days.  Description of facilities: The square footage for the cafeteria/snack bar is approximately 5200 square feet. Seating capacity is 75 people.  Chaffing Dishes: Electric hotplates must be used rather than sterno heat for food that must be kept hot as sterno heating is not allowed in this facility.  Cafeteria/snack bar services will be provided 5 days per week, Monday through Friday, except holidays observed by the Federal government. It shall be the responsibility of the contractor to provide a variety of quality prepared foods. The contractor shall meet business and industry standards of quality and nutrition and comply and support the 1990 and all subsequent revisions of the U.S. Dietary Guidelines. The variety and appearance of food in the cafeteria/snack bar on each operating day shall be consistent with approved food service industry standards for comparable "business and industry" cafeterias.  The vendor is also responsible for maintaining the cleanliness of the cafeteria/snack bar and dining areas; and the proper closing/shut down each day (including completion of a daily security checklist).  The Government will provide a dining area including tables and chairs.  Utilities, including gas, electricity, water and sewer, and utility connections to include gas, electricity, water, and sewer will be provided by the government. This is an intent to award notice, therefore, proposals cannot be submitted directly on this notice.  Interested parties may provide rationale as to why they should be considered directly to the Contract Specialist.  The point of contact for this action is Kim Gallegos, telephone (505) 845-5848. Submissions should be sent electronically to Kim Gallegos at kgallegos@doeal.gov. or mail to NNSA Service Center, P.O. Box 5400, Albuquerque NM 87185, Attn:  Kim Gallegos no later than 4:00 pm, July 7, 2004. Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (JWOD):  In accordance with this act, FAR part 8.7, and as a strong advocate of this acts goals, NNSA will award an agreement to a vendor covered under this act should they submit a response that demonstrates they are capable of performing this effort.  Therefore, interested businesses under this Act are especially encouraged to respond to this notice. Small Business Preference:  NNSA is also a strong advocate for the small business community and interested small businesses/lead teams and joint ventures that qualify as small businesses are encouraged to submit a response to this notice.  The NAICS for this effort is 722310 Food Service Contractors, Cafeteria with a size standard of $17,500,000.

<DESC>NOTE:  In accordance with the Agreement of Defense and Cooperation between the Kingdom of Spain and the United States of America, any contract resulting from this notice/solicitation can only be entered into with companies authorized to carry out these activities in Spain under Spanish law.  Companies must meet the requirements established by Spanish legislation for execution of Government works.  Obtaining a license or permission to operate your company in Spain may be a long process; therefore, any company anticipating interest in future projects should immediately begin the processes that will be required, by contacting the Delegation of Industry.  They have two offices; one in the Madrid province and one in the Andalucia province.  The telephone numbers are: 011 34 91 580 2100 (Madrid) and 011 34 95 507 8620 for Andulucia.  The Air Force intends to solicit proposals for a Firm-Fixed Price contract for Spill Prevention and Response.  Contract magnitude is between $250,000 and $500,000.  The successful contractor will be selected using Past Performance/Price Tradeoff (PPPT) procedures resulting in the best value to the Government.  Past Performance will be rated significantly higher than price.  You are requested to notify the contracting officer, jeffrey.powell@moron.af.mil if you intend to download the solicitation.  It is highly recommended that you register to be notified of any new postings for this pre-solicitation notice and or any other postings published by our office.

If you do not already have one, it is suggested you contact Dunn and Bradstreet at www.dnb.com/dunsno/whereduns.htm or www.dun.es/.  Failure to have a DUNS Number at the time of award may delay the award, and depending on the criticality of the project, may be cause to award to the next qualified offeror who has a valid DUNS Number.  All contractors are advised that they shoudl be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).  Registration can be made on line at http://www.ccr2000.com/.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), Neurodegeneration and Aging Unit (NAU), Neurogenetics Branch (NB) plans to procure an AKTA FPLC FRAC950 system from Amersham Biosciences, 800 Centennial Avenue, Piscataway, New Jersey 08854.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.  The Neurodegeneration and Aging Unit studies the underlying molecular mechanisms of various neurodegenerative disorders.  One project in the lab focuses on understanding the function of a gene involved in Down's syndrome.  NINDS, NAU is attempting to purify the protein for X-ray crystallography, and thus requires the need to purchase an FLPC system to purify our protein of interest.
The laboratory requires the ability to purify biomolecules from complex starting materials derived from cell lysates, tissue homogenates, recombinant protein expression systems and other sources.  The system must be able to perform separations based on a variety of sample characteristics, such as molecular weight, net surface charge, hydrophobicity, while retaining biological activity.  Requirements:  1) AKTA FPLC system shall require a flow rate range of .05-20mls/min at pressures ranging from 0-700 psi; 2) System must be a two-pump gradient system, with dynamic mixing, as evidence suggests that this configuration produces the highest accuracy and precision in gradient formation;  3) System pumps shall allow operation of the system at zero backpressure to ensure system compatibility with standard low pressure chromatography supports often used in affinity chromatography and other techniques; 4) Controller must allow programs to be time-based, volume-based, or column-volume based, and must allow user intervention of a running method (e.g., change of flow rate) without stopping or pausing the run; 5) Entire wetted flow path of the system must be inert to halides; 6) System must include a fraction collector which is fully integrated into the system and fully controllable via the system control software. Installation and training must be provided by the vendor, at no additional cost.  The Amersham Bioscience AKTA FPLC system is the only LC system known to NINDS which meets the control and resolution requirements describe above.  Amersham Bioscience's AKTA FPLC system offers accurate and precise control of salt gradient, motorized valves for column selection, buffer selection, and multi-dimensional chromatography, control up to 9 motorized valves are possible with this system, thus maximizing time efficiency.  In addition, the system is specified for use at 4 C, allowing purification of proteins at a suitable temperature.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EST, July 6, 2004.  If you have any questions they must be submitted in writing to Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent, at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.501(a), with Fakespace Systems, Inc. of Marshalltown, IA, for the upgrade of an existing SAVG immersive visualization system (RAVE) in Gaithersburg, and to extend its immersive visualization capabilities to researchers and software developers located at the NIST Boulder Visualization Laboratory.
 
The existing RAVE system is playing a key role in accelerating scientific discovery as large and complex data sets are becoming more common place at NIST.  The immersive visualization that can only be done with such a system provides much greater insight into this data by allowing scientists to interactively explore the data by literally putting the scientist inside the data. 

The goal of this procurement is to extend these benefits to scientists located in Boulder by allowing simultaneous collaboration with scientists located in Gaithersburg.

Three key components are needed to produce a fully immersive visualization system a large screen that allows the user to stand in front and have full peripheral vision to 
the floor; stereo-graphic viewing for depth; and head position tracking to produce proper perspective as the users moves around and thru the data.

This procurement will provide components for the Boulder VisLab consisting of a single large screen PowerWall (RAVE compatible) meeting the requirements for fully immersive visualization.  The procurement also provides additional tracking capability for the Gaithersburg equipment.

Sole source determination is based on the following:

This system upgrade, like three (3) previous upgrades require intimate knowledge of the existing system.  Only Fakespace has the intimate knowledge of the existing system and software to ensure that the upgrade will integrate into the existing system and be 100% compatible.  If the upgrade to the existing system were not 100% compatible, the NIST research that the visualization supports will be severely impacted.  

The purpose of the Mathematical and Computational Sciences Division is to accelerate scientific research through improved insight into research results gained  with immersive scientific visualization. To achieve theses goals, the Division develops software that will bring the research data into the immersive environment.  

Without 100% compatibility, device specific software will be required, which will double the software effort required to achieve useful visualization of the research data.

The planned implementation of this upgrade is the ability to operate the Gaithersburg and Boulder components as one unified system for collaboration between physical and computer scientists in both locations.  Without 100% compatibility, this ability to operate as a single unit will be severely impacted. 

Finally, the current system has an extended warranty service agreement covering repairs of failed components. The upgrade equipment must not void the current warranty.  The 
addition of equipment from any other company or manufacturer another company will void this warranty.

Fakespace Systems is a small business.  They are the sole manufacturer of this equipment.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, however, responses received by July 7, 2004, will be considered by the Government.

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>A sole source procurement is contemplated to deNovis, Inc. of Lexington, Massachusetts.  The procurement is for a software license, consulting and technical support of their eHD health care administration COTS solution. In December 2002 the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) awarded a competitive contract to IBM to redesign part of the Medicare Fee For Service claims processing system—Common Working File Redesign (CWFR).  IBM proposed an innovative yet untested technology from deNovis.  CMS has a responsibility to exercise due diligence in advance of making a decision to accept deNovis technology as a foundation for Medicare Fee For Service redesign.  For the purposes of testing and validating the deNovis technology and to facilitate independence and guard against potential conflict of interest, CMS will procure deNovis specific products and services outside the confines of the existing CWFR contract.   CMS knows of no other source for this license or these services.

CMS anticipates award of a Firm Fixed Price contract to deNovis, Inc. for a period of performance of twelve (12) months from the date of contract award.

Description of Facilities:  The utility systems consists of the following capital assets:

Fort Dix:
 
A. Water Plant, Distribution System, and Range Wells
The primary water supply source, which supplies Fort Dix, is surface water from the Rancocas Creek, located 5 miles from the water plant.  The raw water is captured at the river and is pumped by three pumps via two 16-inch water lines to the water treatment plant.  The pumping station and pipeline can deliver 4 MGD of raw water to the treatment plant. 
 
1. Water Treatment Plant: The water treatment plant original plant design is 2 MGD and is presently being upgraded to 4 MGD.  Currently sedimentation tanks are being added to the plant.  The treatment consists of pumping the surface water directly to the plant.  Treatment at the plant consists of chemical addition, flocculation, sedimentation, final filtering, and disinfection with chlorination.  After treatment, the water flows to a 500,000 gallon ground storage clear water reservoir.  The treated water is pumped from the ground storage to elevated tanks that provide distribution storage and pressure.  
 
2. Water Distribution System: The water distribution system ranges in size from 2 inches to 16 inches in diameter.  The total length of the system is approximately 527,423 feet.  Within the system there are approximately 341 isolation valves and 475 fire hydrants.  Water storage tanks: There are four water storage tanks with a combined capacity of 2,184,000 gallons.  
 
3. Range Wells:  There are 14 range wells included in this privatization effort which supply water to various ranges located throughout Fort Dix.
 
  
B. Wastewater Treatment Plant, Collection System, and Land Application Site
 
1. Wastewater Treatment Plant:  The wastewater treatment plant was constructed at Fort Dix in 1994 and is situated on and includes approximately 50 acres of land, which is also included in this privatization effort.  The wastewater plant serves Fort Dix and McGuire AFB.  The wastewater treatment facility has an average design capacity of 4.6 MGD.  The peak design plant flow is 12.7 MGD.  The wastewater treatment plant is considered to be a tertiary treatment facility.  The primary treatment consists of two primary settling tanks that remove settleable or easily floatable material.  The sludge removed from the facility is pumped to the sludge dewatering facility for further treatment.  The flow passing through the primary tanks go into the secondary tanks.  The flow is a Bardenpho process; a variation of the active sludge process.  The process removes phosphorus and nitrogen.  The flow from the tanks enters the final settling tanks where the majorities of the solids settle out and are returned to the secondary treatments tanks.  Excess sludge is wasted to the thickener.  Following the final settling tanks the flow enters the gravity filtration tanks where the suspended solids are reduced below 10mg/l and the flow is disinfected by ultraviolet radiation.  
 
2. Wastewater Collection system: The sewer system at Fort Dix consists of a collection system, a number of lift stations and a wastewater treatment plant.  Wastewater collection system pipes range in size from less than 4 inches to 36 inches.  The total length of the sewer collection system is about 267,000 linear feet.  The majority of the line is 8 inches in diameter.  There are about 1,056 manholes located throughout the sewer system.  The sewage flows to the lift station where it is pumped to the treatment plant.  Lift Stations: There are 15 lift stations in the wastewater collection system and once the upgrade contract is complete the number will be reduced to 13 lift stations. 
 
3. Land Application Site (LAS):  The land application site consists of approximately 100 acres of land included in this transfer, 22,760 linear feet of 22-inch force main, and 13 each sampling wells surrounding the LAS.  After disinfection at the wastewater treatment plant, the flow enters the effluent pump station where it is pumped to the LAS and goes into percolation lagoons.  The effluent percolates from the lagoons and recharges the groundwater.
 
McGuire AFB
 
A. Wastewater Collection System:  
All wastewater generated at McGuire AFB is treated at the Fort Dix Wastewater Treatment Plant.  McGuire wastewater collection system consists of a system of gravity and force sewer mains and eight lift stations and four pumping stations.  The wastewater collection system pipe sizes range from 2 inches to 27 inches in diameter, with the majority of the system being 8 inches in diameter.  The total length of the sewer collection system is about 145,563 linear feet.  Most of the network of piping was relined between 1994 and 1996.  The approximate year of construction is identified as 1995 to represent the mid-point of the construction projects to re-line the collection system piping.  The entire wastewater collection system includes about 339 manholes, 9 manhole type lift stations, and four pumping stations.  The McGuire wastewater collection system provides service for approximately 751 facilities.  McGuire wastewater exits McGuire AFB at three separate locations for treatment at the Fort Dix facility.  Wastewater generated in the northwest portion of the installation is collected primarily through gravity mains and one pumping station.  The remainder of the wastewater collection system includes the system on the eastern and southern portions of the installation and the school system north of Wrightstown-Cookstown Road. The system does not include Falcon Courts North and Falcon Courts East Military Family Housing (MFH) areas and a small trailer court, although wastewater from the housing areas and trailer court will flow through the main base system and for treatment at the Fort Dix Wastewater Treatment Plant.  McGuire AFB (including MFH) is currently generating approximately 483 million gallons of wastewater per year.  Base personnel indicated that there were no capacity problems with the collection system.  
REQUIREMENTS:  The general goal of the privatization process at Fort Dix and McGuire AFB is to transfer all capital assets of the water and wastewater treatment facilities to a municipal, private, regional, district or cooperative utility company or other non-Department of Defense entity to own and operate the systems on a long term contractual basis. Specific requirements under the contract will be: (1) the ability to service all areas within the Fort Dix and McGuire AFB and all Federal service premises currently served by Government owned systems that are the subject of this requirement; (2) the ability to provide access to two [2] independent potable water sources to provide redundant supply linkage.  Independent potable water sources are two separate sources of supply from two separate treatment facilities.  One area of consideration [as a source] may be the existing Fort Dix plant.  
 
PROCESS:  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered.     Large businesses are required to submit a subcontracting plan with their offer.     Interested sources shall contact Douglas Smith at (703) 767-9409 to be added to our bidders mailing list.     A copy of the solicitation will be available after issuance on the Internet at http://www.desc.dla.mil/DCM/DCMPage.asp?pageid=246

The solicitation will be available on or after July 2004.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This is not a request for proposals. It is anticipated that RFP-NHLBI-HR-05-05 for a Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC) will be available at: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/funding/index.htm on or about May 14, 2004. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) intends to establish a Clinical Network of ten clinical centers (CCs) and a CCC for the research of treatments for acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS). NHLBI will release separate Request for Proposals (RFPs) for the CCs and the CCC. The Network will develop and conduct randomized controlled clinical trials under multiple protocols for the prevention and treatment of ALI/ARDS. The CCC will be responsible for coordination of all aspects of the ARDSNet, including development of standard operating procedures, coordination of all ARDSNet meetings and committees and development of public and private web sites. The CCC will have primary responsibility for the statistical design and analysis of trials, and for development and conduct of procedures for efficient, confidential automated data collection, entry, and sharing. Data collected will be in a format that allows easy uploading of data from the CCs to the CCC via internet if possible. The CCC will assist in the preparation of reports and manuscripts for publication of trial results. The ARDSNet will function with a Steering Committee (SC) of principal investigators from the CCs and the CCC, and a  representative of the NHLBI. The SC will collaboratively develop, prioritize, and conduct the clinical trials. Protocols developed by the ARDSNet will be reviewed by an independent Protocol Review Committee (PRC) chosen by and reporting to the NHLBI. Conduct of the trials will be monitored by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) chosen by and reporting to the NHLBI. The CCs, each consisting of one or more participating ICUs, will enroll a total of 1650 subjects over five and one-half years of a seven-year project. The CCC will be responsible for the preparation and presentation of protocols to the PRC and interim data reports to the DSMB. Personnel should be experienced in biostatistics and the conduct of clinical trials in critically ill patients. The PI(s) of the CCC will provide leadership in statistical issues including the design of study protocols and analysis of study data. The CCC will be responsible for the design or selection, pre-testing and management of data collection tools, and ensuring confidentiality and quality control of data. The CCC will coordinate pre-testing of data collection systems and have responsibility for reproduction and dissemination of protocols, manuals, and forms. It will also coordinate training of CCC and CC staff in implementing protocols and entering data. Data collection is expected to involve the most modern techniques available that can be supported in intensive care units, in a format easily uploaded from the CCs to the CCC via the internet. A central data collection system that allows periodic download of data from remote sites is preferred.  The CCC will need personnel knowledgeable in the design and uses of decision support tools, and familiar with both bedside data collection systems and automatic downloading of data from laboratory systems. Although not required as part of a proposal, the CCC will be required to develop and submit an automated information systems security plan prior to contract award. The CCC will develop plans for randomization of patients, reporting of data to the DSMB, and analysis of data for preparing manuscripts for peer review. The CCC should be experienced in dealing with the Food and Drug Administration in obtaining approvals for new drugs and/or devices. The CCC will be responsible for arranging for drug blinding and drug distribution as necessary. The CCC will coordinate on-site reviews of patient records by a clinical nurse to validate the accuracy of data transmitted to the CCC.  The CCC will be responsible for monitoring development of informed consent statements. The CCC will coordinate communications among CCs and schedule conference calls and meetings of study committees as needed. The CCC will also organize meetings of the PRC and DSMB, and prepare statistical reports and minutes of these meetings. The PI(s) of the CCC will attend DSMB meetings to present data. The Government intends to award one contract for a period of seven years, on or about September 1, 2005.

<DESC>Question What is the Static dissipation rate that is being looked for? Answer It is desired that the gloves possess static dissipation characteristics. The gloves should hold a minimum of 4000 volts when charged with 5000 volts, and the charge should dissipate in less than .5 seconds. Question We believe that our size run meets the 5 to 95 percentile requirement. If during the selection process the USMC decides that our size run doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t meet the 5 to 95 percentile requirement, do we have the opportunity to add additional sizes or will we be  eliminated at that point? Answer Selection will be made based on many performance characteristics. Size alone will not be a source for rejection. Question Would you please offer a more complete definition of the Natick non standard moisture wicking test method, such as a procedure or test method number that we might reference when requesting testing support from Natick Labs? In requesting a quote and lead-ti me for testing we were advised by Natick that this information would be helpful in processing our request. Answer: The test method can be referenced as Wicking Test Procedure, dated September 7, 1988  Question If neoprene and Velcro are not allowed in either solicitation can you please explain why?  Our Velcro and neoprene are flame resistant and will be independently tested as necessary.  Answer Offerors will be evaluated on the data and samples submitted. Offerors shall submit any gloves/material combination which meet the performance characteristics described in the solicitation.  As stated in the solicitation, selection will be made based on th e evaluation criteria specified and best value to the Government. Question Do the materials you list as allowed include the materials that might be used as bindings, closures, padding, insulation etc?  That is to say, can bindings, closures, padding and insulation or other minor parts of the glove be constructed with materials no t currently listed as allowed?  Answer Offerors will be evaluated on the data and samples submitted. Offerors shall submit any gloves/material combination which meet the performance characteristics described in the solicitation.  As stated in the solicitation, selection will be made based on th e evaluation criteria specified and best value to the Government. Question If these other materials are allowed, do they need to be tested as well?  If so, can you clarify which tests apply to them.  Answer The offeror shall provide data to demonstrate the required performance characteristics.  The Offeror shall provide test results for  tests that are applicable to his or her product.   The Offeror is familiar with his or her product and should know what tes ts are applicable.

<DESC>Question If neoprene and Velcro are not allowed in either solicitation can you please explain why?  I know you didn't  contemplate other solutions than those made with the materials you specifically listed, but our Velcro and  neoprene are flame resistant and will be independently tested as necessary.  Answer Offerors will be evaluated on the data and samples submitted. Offerors shall submit any gloves/material  combination which meet the performance characteristics described in the solicitation.  As stated in the  solicitation, selection will be made based on the evaluation criteria specified and best value to the  Government. Question Do the materials you list as allowed include the materials that might be used as bindings, closures, padding,  insulation etc?  That is to say, can bindings, closures, padding and insulation or other minor parts of the  glove be constructed with materials not currently listed as allowed?  Answer Offerors will be evaluated on the data and samples submitted. Offerors shall submit any gloves/material  combination which meet the performance characteristics described in the solicitation.  As stated in the  solicitation, selection will be made based on the evaluation criteria specified and best value to the  Government. Question If these other materials are allowed, do they need to be tested as well?  If so, can you clarify which tests  apply to them.  Answer The offeror shall provide data to demonstrate the required performance characteristics.  The Offeror shall  provide test results for  tests that are applicable to his or her product.   The Offeror is familiar with his or  product and should know what tests are applicable. Question(s) You have specified the use of several Malden Products.  They have provided us Technical Information  Sheets for their products that we will use.  Will these suffice for all fabric testing requirements for the fleece, or do we have to have the fleece independently tested for all of the tests not mentioned on their  Technical Information Sheets, or do we have to have independently certified tests results for all of the tests  required and not rely on the tech sheets at all, even though the Government specified the material which  they must already know pass these tests as you can logically conclude they wouldn't have specified their use had they not already passed the required tests?  Bottom line, do we need to provide independent  test results for tests applicable to Malden Fabrics.   Our gloves will be made with leather from a supplier of multiple manufacturers submitting proposals.   Their technical Information Sheets show their products we will use meet MIL-DTL-32067 and MIL-L- 40051E. They also have independently verified proof of passing some but not all of the ASTM standards  listed.   Do we need to submit independently certified tests for the others not covered by their Certificate of  Analysis?  Answer Offerors will be evaluated on the data and samples submitted. The data and samples shall address the  performance characteristics listed in the solicitation. As stated in the solocititation selection will be made  based on the evaluation criteria specified and best value to the Government. Question We use neoprene in our gloves and neoprene is not listed as an approved material.  Some Malden products  you specify as approved items have neoprene in them.  In modification 1 of this solicitation you answered yes. to the question  Can the glove contain equivalent or additional materials instead of the  Malden Mills productsÃ¢Â€Â¦.  You then go on to only address Malden Mill's products or their equivalent materials(which is not in the solicitation).  With that background can you clarify whether or not this glove  can contain materials other than those materials listed?  Specifically, can a glove submitted contain neoprene and/or Velcro?  Answer Offferors will be evaluated on t he data and samples submitted. The data and samples shall address the  performance characteristics listed in the solicitation. As stated in the solocititation selection will be made  based on the evaluation criteria specified and best value to the Government.

<DESC>The following information is provided as part of a market survey of industry to determine if any potential contractors have the skill, knowledge, abilities, and equipment required to complete this effort. 

The ICBM System Program Office (SPO) is planning a program for developing strategic grade accelerometer concepts for a modular Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) guidance system. Accelerometer requirements will ultimately be traded at the guidance subsystem level.  It is expected that the program will complete FMA prototype testing in radiation environment in case fitting MK VI.  The intent is that FLEXURED MASS ACCELEROMTER (FMA) is proven to meet 0.5 micro g bias stability and 0.5 PPM scale factor stability in a benign IMU environment and meets nuclear hardness and shock and vibe performance requirements. The following objectives will support the expected objective system:

Bias stability: Threshold: 0.5 micro g’s max. Goal: 0.3 micro g’s max.

Scale factor stability: Threshold: 0.5 PPM max. Goal: 0.3 PPM max

Maturity: TRL 6 by the end of FY 2007 with above accuracy requirements demonstrated in a lab environment representative of the end system including thermal and shock and vibration. Radiation hardening demonstrated for all components other than supporting electronics by the end of FY 2007. Supporting electronics radiation hardening need not be demonstrated until qualification testing in EMD phase. 

Power: Threshold: 9 W max. Goal: 5 W max

Size: Threshold: 17.5 cubic inches max. Goal: 5 cubic inches max

MTBF: Threshold: 300,000 hrs min. Goal: 600,000 hrs min

<SUBJECT>A -- MUE Phase B Sources Sought Synopsis
<SOLNBR>FA8807-04-R-0005
<RESPDATE>060404
<CONTACT>Lt Richard Kniseley, Chief, Modernization Planning Working Group, Phone (310) 363-5390, Fax (310) 363-3844, Email richard.kniseley@losangeles.af.mil - JoAnn Takayama, Contracting Officer, Modernized User Equipment, Phone (310) 363-3670, Fax null, Email joann.takayama@losangeles.af.mil
<DESC>This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of a market survey being conducted by the Air Force to identify potential sources capable of executing the Modernized User Equipment (MUE) Program Phase B effort. System Description:  MUE is part of the overall GPS Modernization Effort (Space/Control/User Segment).  The Modernization upgrades will result in the addition of several new Civil Signals as well as a new military signal and security architecture.  The MUE program is the user segment component of the GPS Modernization program and is to validate that user equipment can be developed that effectively interoperate and exploit the capabilities of the modernized constellation. The MUE Program is nearing completion of Phase A and is preparing to enter Phase B. Phase A activities consist of government development and assessment of MUE technical requirements, alternative acquisition strategies, and preliminary cost estimates.  Additionally, four PRDA contracts were awarded to reduce program risk. Contract tasks included contractor assessment of key technical and design issues related to security architecture, receiver design, and the inclusion of multiple signal processing, YMCA.  Phase A activities are now sufficiently mature to enter into Phase B. The MUE Phase B program is a development program with the objective of demonstrating Y-code/M-code/Course Acquisition-code (CA)-(YMCA) receiving and processing capability using the Protection of Navigation (PRONAV) Security Architecture.  The MUE Program is not a production program and will not directly result in the procurement of MUE under the anticipated Phase B contract effort. The primary products of the development will be validated Government controlled, non-proprietary, specifications (specs) and Interface Control Documents (ICDs) for the GPS Receiver Application Module Standard Electronic Module type E Modernized (GRAM-S/M) receiver card and Ground-based GPS Receiver Application Module-Modernized Small Serial Interface (SSI) (GB-GRAM-M SSI) receiver card.  The GRAM S/M and GB-GRAM-M SSI cards will be developed to validate that operationally relevant cards can be developed based on the Government specs and ICDs and to provide an initial industrial base to support further development and procurement. The GPS JPO will not procure MUE unless directed and funded to do so by the Services.  It is anticipated that MUE procurements will be conducted by platform managers for MUE specific to a platform or by the Services to meet Service wide needs. To assist respondents in understanding the potential scope of this effort the following contract objectives are provided as reference: (a) Develop and deliver production representative YMCA GRAM-S/M and GB-GRAM-M SSI receiver cards in accordance with GRAM-S/M and GB-GRAM-M SSI Technical Requirements Documents (TRDs); (b) Develop and deliver non-proprietary draft GPS Engine specifications and ICDs; (c)	Recommend modifications to GRAM-S/M and GB-GRAM-M SSI specifications and ICDs; (d) Demonstrate compliance with the security functional requirements and the security assurance requirements in the GRAM-S/M and GB-GRAM-M SSI protection profile;
(e) Execute the MUE information assurance security certification plan and recommend appropriate changesSupport integration and test of the GRAM S/M receiver card into a MAGR-2K; (g) Support integration and test of the GB-GRAM-M SSI receiver card into an Army application; (h) Support the update of other MUE and M-code related documents as directed; (i) Establish a strong, near real-time dialog and feedback structure with the GPS JPO to provide government insight, achieve quick issue resolution, and respond to government direction; (j) Develop capability to conduct MUE cryptographic initialization functionality and provide tracking of MUE configurations. GPS user equipment is an important element across the DOD force structure and represents a significant cost for the DOD. Accordingly a major emphasis in this development will be to implement mechanisms that will reduce the cost of non-recurring engineering (NRE) development across all future MUE procurements.  The government recognizes that the GPS Engine represents substantial development costs that are unique to MUE because of the new security architecture and security methods inherent to the M-Code signal and PRONAV.  The government seeks means to ensure that these and other NRE costs do not act as a barrier preventing potential suppliers and developers from entering the MUE market. Specifically, the government is currently investigating third party licensing agreements and data rights. The government intent is that the data rights or third party licensing agreement would allow a third party not currently familiar with the MUE security architecture and security requirements to successfully compete for future MUE developments. Accordingly, respondents to this announcement are encouraged to provide in addition to their capabilities statements information regarding their assessment of the value of data rights and/or licensing agreement and any other suggestions to assist the government in achieving its objective of reducing non-recurring engineering costs for the GPS Engine or MUE as a whole. Respondents are requested to identify any previous applicable experiences in supporting reduction of government NRE costs. After the receiver cards have been developed and delivered to the government the GRAM S/M will be integrated under separate contract into the MAGR-2K to validate the GRAM S/M ICD.  The card developer will supply technical support under an associate contractor agreement during the integration effort. The government currently anticipates that the GB GRAM-M will be integrated into a yet to be selected Army platform. Scope of effort: The MUE Phase B effort is anticipated to have a duration of 48 months, anticipated period of performance is April 2005–April 2009. The purpose of this announcement is to help the government identify interested potential offerors, or teams, capable of achieving the MUE Phase B program objectives within acceptable risks and costs.  Respondents are required to submit a current statement of capability, if they have not already done so.  The capability package should provide a synopsis of relevant capabilities and past experience. In addition, a Request for Information was published on 10 May 2004, in Federal Business Opportunities soliciting for potential sources of commercially available signal simulators to support the execution of Phase B of MUE Program.  See Special Notice, Solicitation Number: Reference-Number-43-MUE. Responses should also indicate the source's intent to be either a prime contractor, subcontractor, or interest in using data rights/third party licensing to become a MUE developer and supplier.  All responses are to be unclassified.  Respondents interested in being a prime contractor should not exceed five (5) one sided pages. Respondents interested in being a subcontractor should not exceed two (2) one sided pages and should briefly identify relevant experience and expertise. Responses must be submitted by email in electronic form in MS Word 98 or higher format or PDF format. All responses must conform to 8.5 x 11 inch pages, with font no smaller than 12 point.  If respondents wish to include proprietary or competition sensitive data, they must request additional directions from Ms. Iris Green. Provide your statement of capability or contact Ms Iris Green at email Iris.Green@losangeles.af.mil. This synopsis is for planning purposes only any information submitted by respondents to this synopsis is strictly voluntary. Additional questions to the Government may be included under separate cover, the government reserves the right to not respond to all questions but will make an effort to respond to questions. All questions will be considered in future program planning efforts. This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bids (IFB), nor does its issuance restrict the government as to its ultimate acquisition approach. The government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this notice, nor pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to the Sources Sought request. In addition, the government is interested in receiving industry views regarding the ongoing government acquisition planning efforts. The government intends to post draft and planning documents in the GPS Bidder's Library as they become available to allow industry to view and make comments.  Parties need to register with the GPS Bidder's Library, to obtain access.  Please submit a letter listing all of the individuals requiring access, and justification for access, and all contact information inclusive of email address.  Please submit requests to Lt Richard Kniseley at 2420 Vela Way, Suite 1467, El Segundo, CA, 90245, Phone: 310-363-5390, Fax: 310-363-3844;  email:  Richard.Kniseley@losangeles.af.mil.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Ocean Service (NOS), National Marine Sanctuary Program (NMSP), Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary and Underwater Preserve (TBNMS&UP) intends to contract with the Alpena County George M. Fletcher Library (ACL) located in Alpena, Michigan to house donated artifacts. The Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary and Underwater Preserve, designated in 2000, is a partnership between NOAA and the state of Michigan for cooperative management and protection of Thunder Bay’s underwater cultural resources. The 448-square mile Sanctuary protects an estimated 160 historically significant shipwrecks ranging from nineteenth century wooden side-wheelers to twentieth century steel-hulled steamers. In 2003, C. Patrick Labadie and June Perry donated their personal collection of Great Lakes shipping history materials to the Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary and Underwater Preserve.  Their donation, which focuses on 19th and early 20th century Great Lakes vessels, constitutes the majority of the Thunder Bay Sanctuary Research Collection.  The Thunder Bay Sanctuary Research Collection includes books, manuscripts, maps, charts, shipbuilding plans, photographs, negatives, slides, vertical/card files, microfilm, and videos.  The collection is owned by the Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary and Underwater Preserve and housed at the Alpena County Library. The National Marine Sanctuary Program’s mission includes conducting research to further our knowledge of sanctuary resources, as well as educating the public about these nationally significant resources. The Labadie/Perry collection offers a tremendous opportunity to take a giant step toward these goals.  The collection will not only be instrumental in the management and research of the resources within the TBNMS&UP, but it will also be extremely valuable to other private, local, state, federal, and international efforts to manage and research submerged cultural resources in the Great Lakes. The collection will be housed at the library so it can be made available to researchers and the general public alike.  The library is well-suited to care for the collection.  In addition to having ample space and necessary environmental controls, the library has the staff to oversee and catalog the collection  Longer term plans for collection entail digitizing the material and making it available on the Internet Atleast 14 hours of staffing per week, rental space and general supplies are needed to maintain this project. The Alpena County Library shall also provide, catalogue materials and add them to an electronic database, train interns and volunteers to assist with managing the Thunder Bay Sanctuary Research Collection, facilitate the long term goal of digitize the Thunder Bay Sanctuary Research Collection and provide adequate environmental controls for preservation of the Thunder Bay Sanctuary Research Collection. The Government only knows of no other qualified source. The intended procurement is for services for which the Government intends to acquire from one source under the authority of 41USC253©(1). Any business sources able to provide this service are encouraged to respond to this announcement within 10 days after its’s publication. Interested firms should submit in writing, their name, address, point of contact, telephone number, business size and a brief statement regarding their capability ad qualification to provide the service. This information should be faxed to 816-426-7530, Attn: Sharon Walker. This acquisition is being conducted pursuant to the guidelines set forth in FAR Part 13.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received as a result of the notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. If no qualified responses are received, the Government intends to contract with Alpena County George N. Fletcher Library for the service referenced. This is not a small business set-aside.

<DESC>The U.S. Postal Services (USPS) is seeking sources to participate in a supplier workshop to discuss management of trash removal and recycling services. 
Specifically, USPS is interested in hearing innovative ideas to approach these services from a Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) perspective.  Ideally, trash removal costs would be minimized by eliminating recyclable materials from the waste stream.  Workshops will be held August 17 and 18 in Memphis, TN.  Suppliers will have one hour to make their presentations, followed by one hour Q&A session.

Interested suppliers must submit an information packet to:
Mark Treese
225 N Humphreys Blvd
Memphis, TN  38166-6260

This packet should include a brief company history, an outline of the proposed presentation, and examples of how the supplier has lowered TCO of these services for other clients. 

Time and scheduling constraints allow for only six suppliers to participate in this workshop, however non-selection will not influence any future requests for services.

<DESC>Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) is undertaking a transformation initiative to improve the delivery of immigration and citizenship services.  As part of this initiative, USCIS is planning to issue one or more solicitation(s) to obtain a solution that is customer-centric, integrated, streamlined, cost effective, and focused on data sharing, digitization of paper records and evolution and integration of legacy immigration systems data.  The acquisition(s) are planned to encompass the design, integration,
and implementation of: Reengineered business processes, IT application and information systems, Technology assets, Training, and Organizational change management.

As part of its acquisition strategy, USCIS plans to involve industry experts in the requirements definition and acquisition planning processes.  As a first step, USCIS is issuing a Request for Information (RFI) to solicit information from industry leaders.  Specifically, USCIS seeks to obtain (1) high-level alternative conceptual solutions based on vendor experience in environments similar to that of USCIS; (2) information about "Information Management" technology products and services offered by full and partial solution providers, including both system integrators and specialized niche providers of  "best of breed" products, services, and components compatible with a total solutions architecture; and (3) suggestions on alternative acquisition approaches to designing, developing, acquiring, operating, and managing the USCIS systems transformation solution.  USCIS is particularly interested in "Share in Savings" approaches, including mechanisms for payment from accrued savings.  To facilitate meaningful responses, USCIS is establishing a reading room with background information on the USCIS IT and records management environment.

Based on vendor responses to the RFI, USCIS may conduct an Industry Day followed by one-on-one sessions with selected vendors.  One-on-one sessions may be conducted with "teams" of vendors as well as individual vendors (based on vendor preference and at the discretion of USCIS).  Refer to the RFI document for additional information, including how to structure responses to the RFI.  Interested vendors should provide responses by 4:00 p.m. on June 25, 2004, to: Jim.Shotwell@dhs.gov.

<DESC>Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) is conducting a market survey to determine industry’s capabilities to design, develop, produce, and support non-lethal mission payload modules (NLMPM) (sub-systems) that can be integrated initially on the Gladiator Tactical Unmanned Ground Vehicle (TUGV) and subsequently on other Department of Defense tactical vehicles and small watercraft. The TUGV is a single unmanned ground vehicle platform that will accommodate plug-and-fight mission modules providing Marine Forces with an unmanned, tele-operated / semi-autonomous ground vehicle for remoting combat tasks in order to reduce risk to friendly forces and neutralize threats. 
Non-Lethal Weapons are defined as follows: 
“Weapons that are explicitly designed and primarily employed so as to incapacitate personnel or materiel, while minimizing fatalities, permanent injury to personnel, and undesired damage to property and the environment. Unlike conventional lethal weapons that destroy their targets principally through blast penetration and fragmentation, non-lethal weapons employ means other than gross physical destruction to prevent the target from functioning. Non-lethal weapons are intended to have one, or both, of the following characteristics:  a) They have relatively reversible effects on personnel or materiel and, b) They affect objects differently within their area of influence.”
The NLMPM may include the following components:  non-lethal payload(s), launcher, mounts/brackets, electrical interface/cabling, sensor(s), and fire control interface. The government desires that the module be backward compatible with existing or planned non-lethal payloads/munitions.
Remotely employed NLMPMs should assist the warfighter with mission tasks by enhancing engagements, providing a broader range of desired and precisely directed target effects, and significantly reducing injury to warfighters. They are envisioned to increase standoff ranges and provide the warfighter a range of capabilities that are offensive in nature, increasing range of delivery, high volume of non-lethal fire, screening, and/or communications.
The NLMPMs shall be expeditionary in design and support, inherently simple, durable, tailored, and easily integrated into the TUGV power and control systems, as well as have independent target tracking and acquisition, power, and control systems when mounted on other systems or in the ground emplaced mode. The NLMPMs will capitalize on the TUGV’s internal design capabilities for range finding, power, maneuverability, etc. when attached to the TUGV. However, it is desirable that the NLMPMs be capable of being detached from the TUGV and mounted on other platforms and tactical vehicles such as the HMMWV, LAV, and potentially an Army Future Combat System (FCS) variant. In addition, the NLMPM should have the capability to be dismounted and employed independent of any platform (e.g., ground emplaced, mounted to a structure, etc.).
OPERATIONAL CONCEPT:
The TUGV is designed to support dismounted ground forces during the performance of their mission, across the spectrum of conflict and range of military operations. The NLMPM is intended to be capable of engaging targets, both point and area, at various ranges and elevations relative to the base mounting platform (TUGV, tactical vehicle, etc.), using a variety of non-lethal munitions and agents.
The TUGV will execute the following non-lethal mission tasks:  (a) support ground forces to disperse crowds who have become unruly and dangerous to the mission; (b) control groups of personnel by using area effects that force them to either move from one area to another or that corral them into one area; (c) control individuals by using point effects that cause individuals to comply with the desires of the force--ringleaders can be singled out of large groups and removed from the area, generally defusing the situation; (d) deny an area to personnel and vehicles by strategically positioning the TUGV and NLMPM such that it prevents passage thereby creating a clear area; and, (e) clearing large facilities can be accomplished by either driving the TUGV (or other tactical vehicle) into the facility or by engaging the facility from the outside if the non-lethal weapons (NLW) effects can penetrate the walls. 
While the TUGV is still under development, for purposes of this RFI the following design parameters of the NLMPM apply:  (a) the TUGV, with NLMPM, must possess the capability to traverse and search to acquire targets quickly in day or night, in all weather conditions, and deliver a high volume of non-lethal fire to dissuade individuals or groups while directly supporting dismounted infantry on urban and/or rough terrain; (b) shall be capable of being operated by the TUGV operator with the TUGV operator control unit (OCU) out to the same distances set in the TUGV ORD (a 2 km (threshold), 4 km (objective) radius of the OCU); (c) shall be capable of engaging targets at different elevations in relation to the position of the TUGV; (d) shall be capable of acquiring and engaging a point target at a minimum range of 50 meters (threshold), and 100 meters (objective); (e) shall be capable of engaging an area target 5m x 5m (threshold), 20m x 20m (objective) with a volume of non-lethal fire at a minimum range from the vehicle of 50 meters (threshold) to 100 meters (objective); (f) NLMPM consumable non-lethal munitions reloading shall be accomplished by one individual in less than 10 minutes (threshold), 5 minutes (objective); (g) shall be capable of being remotely employed, separate from the TUGV and the OCU; (h) shall not exceed the payload capacity of the TUGV (ideally no more than 300 lbs); and, (i) shall allow NLMPMs to be attached or detached in no more than 15 minutes by two Marines (threshold), 10 minutes (objective.)
RESPONSES:
Information is requested on concepts for a NLMPM as described above and any technologies that might be components of such a system, for example:  non-lethal payloads, launcher, platform interfaces, target acquisition and fire control, and related technologies that would facilitate the employment of non-lethal weapons platforms. We also request respondents provide their assessment of the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of their technologies and address any technical issues, challenges, opportunities associated with integration into an NLMPM system. 
The Government requests one hard copy submission not to exceed 20 pages, and an accompanying CD with documents formatted in Microsoft Office products. Proprietary information should be marked appropriately to ensure proper protection and handling. Classified information should not be submitted in response to this request. 
Interested firms are requested to respond no later than 23 July 2004, with a Capability Statement outlining their ability to meet or exceed this potential requirement. Interested sources should send all Capability Statements to:  Commanding General, Marine Corps Systems Command, 2200 Lester Street, ATTN:  IWS (Maj R. A. Hollen), Quantico, VA 22134. No submissions via E-Mail will be accepted. THE SUBMISSION OF THIS INFORMATION IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PROCURE ANY ITEM/SERVICES, NOR FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR THE INFORMATION RECEIVED. NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS.

<SUBJECT>A--ADVANCED AIR GROUND COMMUNICATIONS CONCEPTS FOR AIR TRAFFIC SERVICES
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICIATION.  IT IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. In responding to this notice, please refer to “Advanced Air Ground Communications Concepts for Air Traffic Services” or NNC04PRA003L.  Send information/literature/qualification statement no later than July 19, 2004 to the e-mail or postal address as provided herein.  NASA does not intend to award a contract based on this information.  This RFI is for planning purposes only and to allow industry the opportunity to provide information relative to the goals set forth below. NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) is seeking information about advanced concepts in future air-ground communications systems for potential use in providing air traffic services (ATS).	For the purposes of this RFI, ATS includes the following services: separation assurance; air traffic control advisory; traffic management synchronization; navigation; airspace management; emergency and alerting; flight planning; infrastructure/information management; and traffic management strategic flow.  Transition to this future system would begin in the 2015 – 2020 time period, and the useful life of the system should be at least 20 to 30 years.   The information received from this RFI will be used by NASA GRC in support of a collaborative Future Communications Study between the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Eurocontrol.	The FAA/Eurocontrol Future Communications Study will help to define and design a global air-ground communications system that provides for world-wide interoperability among all ATS users.  The work plan and associated terms of reference for the FAA/Eurocontrol Future Communications Study can be found at http://www.eurocontrol.int/faa-euro/AP-group-meetings/ap17/ap17.htm   NASA GRC is responsible for Technical Theme 3 in the Future Communications Study work plan, to investigate new technologies for mobile communication.  This RFI is intended to provide input for conducting Task 3.1, Technology Pre-screening.  The Advanced Engineering & Sciences Division of ITT Industries, Inc. is under contract to assist NASA GRC in the technology pre-screening task.  They and other contractors of NASA and the FAA will have access to the information submitted for the purpose of conducting the technology pre-screening process.   NASA GRC seeks information on candidate system solutions for mobile communications that can be used for ATS both domestically and internationally.  Both current capabilities (based on existing or planned products) and potential future concepts are encouraged in response to this RFI.  Concepts based on terrestrial broadcast, air-to-air relay, and/or satellite relay are acceptable as inputs to the technology pre-screening process. It is desirable that information provided to describe the advanced air-ground communications system concepts include: •	A technical description of the system solution including but limited to: air interface; end-to-end latency (pilot-to-controller and controller-to-pilot if asymmetric); ATS communications services provided; protocols; network topology; spectrum required; security features; and any simplifying assumptions needed to meet or exceed the design goals described below.   •	Areas of expected improvement over current air-ground communications systems for ATS. •	Scalability of the system to meet increasing demands and the system’s ultimate total capacity. •	A description of the impact (high-level transition plan, schedule and relative cost) on current airborne and ground avionics and infrastructure.  •	Technical maturity of the system solution, including status of applicable standards, commercial availability of electronics, and estimates of time for infusion into the National Airspace System. The following high-level functional design goals for a mobile air-ground communications system to be used in providing ATS are intended to provide insight into the performance of the current system, and desired characteristics of a future system:	 •	Increase the channel capacity of the current air-ground communications system. •	Utilize the VHF aeronautical communications frequency band, or justify the utilization of other aeronautical frequency allocations.  •	Provide for an orderly and efficient transition from the current VHF communications system. •	Provide a mechanism for “real-time” voice, with requisite combined performance in latency and channel access that promotes efficient and effective communications between a controller and the set of aircraft within the controlled airspace. •	Provide a mechanism for both addressable and broadcast data functions. •	Provide a mechanism to specify various Quality of Service (QoS) classes for data transfer. •	Within each QoS class, provide a mechanism for scheduling and prioritizing data delivery. •	Include configurable security measures to provide user authentication features. •	Provide a mechanism to control multiple sectors in the same geographic area. •	Provide aircraft position location capability.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

This is accomplished by providing internet access and general library services to the Library patrons to include researching biographical information for commanders prior to the visitation of dignitaries, locating general historical information for publications, and providing basic Air Force historical information for foreign officers. The Library plays an important role in the U.S. Air Force mission and educational support to the Base population.

<DESC>Please note that the anticipated award date has been moved to mid-July, but the due date for responses remains the same.  Offerors with a reasonable chance for award will be invited to give an oral presentation of their response to the Government.  

Questions and Answers are as follows:
Q.	Can you provide a list of the data sources that Regal Decision Systems has used for their model, since using the same sources (assuming alternate sources are not superior in quality) would be beneficial from consistency and compatibility standpoint?
A.	 No, this could be a potential conflict of interest in some cases, and are not relevant in others.	

Q.	Has Regal Decision Systems been allowed to participate in this bidding? If not, would you be able to recommend a point of contact at Regal Decision Systems to discuss model related issues?
A.	No, Regal is not bidding on this contract, and we can provide a contact but need to know who is asking what type of question in order to provide an appropriate point of contact.  

Q.	Considering that some of the data needed might be considered proprietary to
the data owners (airlines, airports, etc.) would TSA provide a “mandate” for the contractor to facilitate sharing of such data?
A.	No. Initially the successful contractor will need to provide the data from their own sources or from what is in the public domain.  Our intent is to improve the quality of the data by working with the airlines, airports and industry organizations in coordination with the contractor.

Q.	Would TSA allow the contractor to be reimbursed for the possible costs of acquiring not-published data and to exclude such costs estimate from the quote due June 25th?
A.	TSA will not separately reimburse the contractor candidate for acquiring non-public data for the purpose of bidding on this contract.  Any costs incurred by the contractor candidate must be recovered through the successful bidding for this contract.  
	If you wish to exclude the costs of acquiring not-published data in your response, please do so, and note as much in the response.  This may be negotiable.  

Q.	Can TSA supply a complete list of the airports and terminals that shall be considered to be within the scope of this contract?
A.	There are in excess of 450 airports currently serviced by TSA and in the scope of the contract.  However, additions and deletions to this list occur frequently and TSA will provide the list of airports that require data at any point in time.  The important realization is that this is not a static list, and the contractor must be able to add and subtract to the list as required. The contractor should expect the list to change by +/- 5% annually.

Q.	Is there any additional directions related to the scope of this project not included in the RFQ?
A.	The contractor must be willing to work with TSA in using data that may become available to TSA from other sources, and in working with TSA to acquire additional and/or better quality data.	

Q.	Can you confirm when the first batch of data must be provided? The Statement of Work (paragraph 3.4 on the last page) seems to indicate that it is only one day after the anticipated award date of June 30, 2004. 
A.	Approximately August 16, 2004.  (Please note that the anticipated award date has been moved out to mid-July.)

Q.	What does "NSP" in attachment B mean?
A.	Not Separately Priced

Q. 	 Some data items such as load factors and originating percentages can only be obtained after the FY2004 cycle (after 9/30/2004), but they are listed as part of deliverables for July 1, 2004.  
A. 	TSA is requesting that the most current, highest quality information is supplied.  Please note any circumstances such as this in your response.  

Q.	The scope of work does not address the FIS re-check/ re-screening. Is International-to-Domestic transfer passenger screening part of the scope? Does TSA request any data related to that?
A. 	This work is not excluded in the RFQ, but should be in the scope of the contract

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) intends to award a firm-fixed price Purchase Order (PO) for regular aviation industry-specific data updates for our Regal Decision Systems’ staffing modeling system.  Original award is for three months, with two one-year option periods.  This requirement is set-aside for small businesses.

The TSA anticipates award by Wednesday, June 30, 2004 with an anticipated start date of July 1, 2004.  Award will be made to the offeror whose quote is considered to be of best value to the Government. 

BACKGROUND:  During 2002, all passenger and property screening was taken over by Federal screeners and related personnel as mandated by Congress under the Aviation and Transportation Security Act.  Significant effort resulted in the planning, staffing and training of over 50,000 positions.  During 2003/2004 a significant effort was initiated with REGAL Decision Systems to develop a comprehensive staffing modeling system to be used as a tool for the TSA in planning capacity, establishing staffing budgets, and scheduling staff at the TSA airports. With the completion of this effort scheduled mid 2004, we now require a Data Sustainability Phase which will provide updated aviation industry specific data on a regular and ongoing basis.

DESCRIPTION OF WORK:  All commercial USA airline data that is required to operate the REGAL staffing model system must be provided monthly in a specific format for updating the system.  This information must include data for scheduled and unscheduled airline service such as:
Airport, Terminal, Airline, Operator, Flight Number, Destination, Equipment Type, Departure Time, Days of Operation, Effective Date, Discontinue Date, Sector, Seats, Stage Length, Number of Available Seats per Aircraft, Terminal or Concourse location of each Flight, Load Factors, Connecting %, Passenger Arrival Curves, Passengers Per Group, Bags Per Passenger, Seasonality Impact on Bags Per Passenger, Percent Oversize, Bags, Seasonality Impact on Arrivals, Contact Ratio/Check-In Split. 

A comprehensive list of data is provided in the RFQ documents.

Please contact Heather Morvant at:  Heather.Morvant@dhs.gov to have all documents transmitted.  These include:  Instructions, Attachment A - Company Information, Attachment B - Pricing, Attachment C - Statement of Work.

All attachments must be received in order to submit an offer.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to address potential offerors questions.

Question 1: What I do not yet understand is that you "must not require liquid nitrogen cooling" however a filter wheel is required. Typically a filter wheel for best performance is integrated into the LN2 dewar which conflicts with the "no LN2" specification. Please clarify this point.

Answer to Question 1: The filter wheels are optional items
(CLIN 0003), Option II and (CLIN 0004), Option III. The Government is aware that a filter wheel or filters will introduce noise into the system, however the targets that we typically measure have very high IR outputs. The system is required to have a stirling cooler or equivalent because the system is intended to be used both in the laboratory environment and in the field where the liquid nitrogen is not always convenient or practical.

Is there a specific requirement for the base, wood, (plywood, walnut, particle board) plastic, stone? 	ANSWER:  The base should be large enough to support the model and the engraved plaque.  Vendors may use creativity in their solution, ie whether it is wood, Plexiglas, crystal, etc, whatever, enhances the model and not detract. 4.  There is no requirement for engraving, but is there a requirement for the brass plaque to be supplied. 	ANSWER:  There is no requirement for the brass plaque to be supplied.   5.  Do the trophies need to be packaged separately? 	ANSWER:  YES, the trophies need to be packaged separately for protection and safety of the model not esthetics.   6.  Does it matter what type of silver or grey metal? 	ANSWER:  It does not matter what type of silver or grey metal is used.  Creativity in final solution is encouraged especially if the detail is enhanced. 7.  What material is requested for the Space Station trophies?	 	ANSWER:   The type of material specified for the International Space Station (ISS) is specified in the on-line RFP as silver or grey metal. 8.

6 		Project Descriptions and Profile

		The Ministry of Energy has taken the lead in moving forward its Energy Sector Master Plan and Energy Strategy Plan to balance energy reserves, production and consumption in Thailand.  The country relies heavily on its domestic natural gas reserves from the Gulf of Thailand for power generation as well as for industry.  The Ministry has recently approved PTT Public Company Limited to develop a $650-800 million LNG Receiving Terminal for Thailand by 2008-2010.  The project aims to both enhance the country’s strategy for energy security and expand the availability of energy reserves from 30 years to 50 years.  PTT anticipates the project will lead to the more efficient use of local natural gas, a reduction imported oils, and a cleaner environment through the use of a cleaner fuel.  Although LNG would have to be imported to Thailand from Indonesia or the Middle East, it is anticipated that LNG would be available at a price competitive to domestic natural gas.  

		In the area of electricity supply, the Ministry forecasts that an additional 1,000 MW of power each year will be needed to meet the rising demand.  It anticipates the use of LNG to fuel the growth in power generation capacity.  To promote investment in this sector, the government is seeking to privatize state enterprises and reform the power sector.  Key entities in line for privatization in the second half of 2004 are the Electricity Authority of Thailand (EGAT), the Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA) and the Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA).  All of them are long-term partners of USTDA and major buyers of U.S. products.  Privatization and reform could hold much potential for over $10 billion in investment opportunities in power generation and distribution during the next 10 years.

		The government has also set an ambitious goal to transform Thailand into an energy trader and to extend the country’s energy role beyond its national boundaries.  Major steps forward in this direction have been taken in the Sri Racha Energy Hub and the Strategic Energy Land Bridge.  The DM will review these projects and their ability to realize Thailand’s goal as a regional hub.

Project Title:  Alternative Energy Projects in Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan

1		Scope of Work

The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (“USTDA”) requires services under this non-personal services Contract to support or improve its decision-making relative to the funding of projects and activities in developing and middle income countries. The Contractor shall provide a report to USTDA, which will: 

1.2		assess and justify whether or not USTDA should provide funding for the proposed feasibility study or other activities; 

1.3		assess any alternative study or activities which the Contractor sees as viable options for USTDA consideration; and 

1.4		provide supporting analysis and recommendations on the above information in a final report that analyzes all the relevant issues, as called for in Section C.

The Contractor for this activity shall travel to Uzbekistan and Azerbaijan to review potential projects.  


2  		Delivery & Performance Requirements

2.1		Kick-Off Meeting with the USTDA Program Office

Upon award, the Contractor shall contact USTDA’s Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) to schedule a meeting to discuss details of the Contract assignment.  Unless otherwise advised by the COTR, this meeting will be held at USTDA’s office in Arlington, Virginia. The COTR shall provide the Contractor with names and addresses of the project sponsor(s), other pertinent entities to contact in the United States and overseas, and any other relevant details that may impact upon the design and/or evaluation of the proposed project(s).  




2.2		Pre-Visit Report

Prior to departure to the host country, the Contractor shall provide the COTR a pre-visit written report of 3-5 pages containing the proposed schedule or itinerary, preliminary strategies or findings on project viability, financing options, U.S. company interest in the project, a list of contacts to be made during the visit and a pre-visit checklist of issues, information and questions to be utilized during the visit.  

2.3		USTDA Responsibility

USTDA will advise the U.S. Embassy in the host country of the Contractor’s proposed travel itinerary prior to departure and request that they provide the Contractor with names and addresses of suggested appropriate host country officials with whom to meet.

2.4		Contractor’s Host Country Travel 

The Contractor shall travel to the host country to meet with relevant project officials and with the U.S. Embassy.    The Contractor shall contact the U.S. Embassy upon arrival and prior to departure for briefing and debriefing meetings.   While the Embassy may be able to assist the Contractor in arranging some initial meetings with host country officials, the Contractor is responsible for arranging the meetings as well as logistics for the visit, i.e., hotel accommodations, transportation, and interpretation services. In some cases, the Contractor may need to Contract with a local entity to assist with these logistics.  Local entities may not provide the technical work of substance for the creation of the DM report. 

2.5		Contractor Meaningful Discussions

The Contractor shall hold meaningful discussions with appropriate contacts to determine and gauge the interest of potential project financiers and potential U.S. suppliers and assess whether the proposed project(s) is economically, financially, and technically viable.  The Contractor shall analyze the potential procurement of U.S. goods and services for project implementation by categories and dollar values.  The analysis shall include an assessment of the project risks and its financial viability, the priority of the project and political/social/organizational support it has, potential sources of financing, and the capability and experience of the project sponsor.  The analysis shall also include an assessment of the social and economic development impacts of the proposed project.

2.6		USTDA Report Objectives

If the Contractor recommends that USTDA fund the study (ies) in a phased approach, and/or if any outstanding issues should be resolved or conditions met before funding is approved, those phases, issues and/or conditions should be clearly explained in the recommendation.

2.6.2		The Contractor shall provide a final report to the USTDA, which will: 

2.6.2.1		assess and justify whether or not USTDA should provide funding for a feasibility study of the proposed project(s); 

2.6.2.2		assess any alternative or other activities which the Contractor sees as viable options for USTDA consideration; and 

2.6.2.3		provide recommendations on the above information in a final report that analyzes all relevant issues, as cited in Sections 3.1 through 3.15.

2.6.3		Contractor recommendations shall be based upon USTDA funding criteria, which are that the project must: 

2.6.3.1 		be likely to receive implementation financing, and in addition, have a procurement process that provides “equal access” to U.S. firms;

2.6.3.2		represent an opportunity for sales of U.S. goods and services that is many times greater than the initial investment of USTDA assistance;

2.6.3.3		be a development priority of the project sponsor and country where the project is located and have the endorsement of the U.S. Embassy in that nation; and

2.6.3.4		involve U.S. companies that are facing strong competition from foreign companies receiving subsidies and other support from their governments.

6	Project Descriptions and Profile

The Government of Uzbekistan has recently increased efforts targeted at developing Uzbekistan’s solar energy sector.  Uzbekistan, with its sunny, dry climate, is considered to be a particularly good candidate for solar energy development.  In July of 2003, the Government of Uzbekistan sent a small delegation to the U.S. to meet with the National Renewable Energy Laboratories in Florida, as well as with Unisolar, a private company in Michigan that produces components for manufacturing photovoltaic equipment.  Uzbekistan currently has one photovoltaic factory, Foton, and the Government of Uzbekistan would like to develop its capacity, as well as the potential for the use of photovoltaics in smaller towns and villages around Uzbekistan.  

Concurrently, the Government of Azerbaijan has requested assistance in developing its wind, solar and biomass resources.  The capital city of Azerbaijan, Baku, originally meant “city of wind”, and the government would like to employ this resource to diversify Azerbaijan’s energy supply, as well as promote more environmentally friendly technologies.  The Government of Azerbaijan has been in contact with the Tennessee Valley Authority and the Joint Institute for Energy and Environment regarding how best to use wind energy, but it is agreed that closer study of the issues is warranted, especially from the standpoint of commercial viability.  The Government of Azerbaijan has also requested assistance in evaluating potential biomass projects.
