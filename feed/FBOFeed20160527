<DESC>In accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System (AMS) Policy 3.2.2.4, the purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of FAAâ€™s intention to contract with Honeywell Technology Solutions, Inc. (HTSI) of Longmont, Colorado using single-source procedures.

The FAA intends to establish a â€œbridgeâ€ contract extension with HTSI for services currently provided under the Corrective Maintenance Contract (DTFAWA-11-C-00005A).  The contract extension is required for the continuity of maintenance support for physical security systems at 524 staffed FAA facilities through September 2017. A competitive SIR incorporating this requirement was cancelled on February 1, 2016. Subsequently, the FAA has decided to proceed with a new competitive SIR for the maintenance requirement. The period of time needed to develop and issue a SIR and award a contract will likely take 9 to 12 months.

The present contract will end September 16, 2016, leaving no other vehicle for addressing failed security systems after that date.  A â€œbridgeâ€ contract will support repairs of critical physical security systems until a competitive contract is awarded. 

A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement.

The period of performance will be 9 to 12 months.

The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The FAA is not liable for any costs associated with the preparing of a response to this announcement. All responses to this announcement must be directed to amy.wright@faa.gov no later than 5pm EDT June 2, 2016.

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contracting Office Address:<br /></span></strong>Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 9609 Medical Center Drive, Room 1E144, Bethesda, MD 20892, UNITED STATES
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Description:<br /></span></strong>National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB), plans to procure on a sole source basis support services to link the USRT cohort with the virtual pooled cancer registry database, from the University of Minnesota (UMN), Department of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, 420 Delaware Street S.E., 807 Mayo, Minneapolis, MN 55455</p>
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1) and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6. The North American Industry Classification System code is 541990 and the business size standard is $15.0M.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>The period of performance is estimated as follows:<br />Base Period (non-severable discrete work segment): June 24, 2016 through June 23, 2017<br />Option I (non-severable discrete work segment): November 24, 2016 through May 23, 2018<br />Option II (non-severable discrete work segment): November 24, 2017 through May 23, 2018</p>
<p>It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.</p>
<p>The Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) is a research program of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), one of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The Division is the world's most comprehensive cancer epidemiology research group. Its renowned epidemiologists, geneticists, and biostatisticians conduct population and multidisciplinary research to discover the genetic and environmental determinants of cancer and new approaches to cancer prevention. The Division's research impacts public health policy in the United States and around the world.</p>
<p>The research mission of the Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB) is to identify, understand, and quantify the risk of cancer in populations exposed to medical, occupational, or environmental radiation, and to advance understanding of radiation carcinogenesis.</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to procure support services for an ongoing radiation epidemiology cohort study of U.S. Radiologic Technologists (USRT). The objectives of this contract are to link the USRT cohort with the virtual pooled cancer registry database to: (a) identify new cancers in study participants that were not reported by questionnaire responders; (b) identify new cancers in subjects who did not complete one or more questionnaires; (c) assess the accuracy of self-reported cancers; (d) obtain detailed medical information on incident cancers regardless of source; and (e) evaluate the completeness of the virtual pooled cancer registry.</p>
<p>Since 1982, the REB and the University of Minnesota (UMN) have conducted a cohort study of cancer incidence and mortality among 146,022, primarily female (73%), U.S. radiologic technologists (USRT) to quantify radiogenic risks from protracted low dose exposures and to determine the applicability of current radiation risk estimates. Other studies of medical radiation workers have examined substantially smaller, mostly male, populations of radiologists and radiologic technologists. A fourth survey of the cohort was conducted during 2012-2013 to obtain updated information on cancer incidence, cancer and other disease risk factors, work history, and personal medical radiation exposures. About 58,000 of 94,000 (62%) known living cohort members completed the fourth survey.</p>
<p>The National Association of American Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR), with funding support from the Division of Cancer Control and Population Studies, NCI, is currently constructing a virtual pooled cancer registry for use in conducting national cancer surveillance and cancer incidence follow-up in epidemiologic cohort studies. The USRT study and another ongoing cohort study have been selected to participate in a test of the completeness and utility of the pooled virtual cancer registry for such studies. A major benefit of participating in this test will be the opportunity to identify new cancers in USRT study participants. <br /><br />NAACCR will initially provide a summary of the total number of cancers identified by state. After obtaining necessary state IRB approvals, NAACCR will provide a file containing individual-specific information on incident cancers (i.e. date of diagnosis, ICDO code, cell type, stage, grade, receptor status, genetic markers, other) and demographic characteristics (i.e. year of birth, gender, race, state of residence). To assess the completeness of cancer ascertainment in USRT cohort members, observed total cancer and cancer-specific incidence in study participants will be compared with expected incidence based on general U.S. population rates. Additionally, self-reported cancers will be compared with registry-derived cancers overall, by time period, and by <br />geographic area. Accuracy of self-reported diagnoses will also be evaluated.<br /><br />Contractor shall perform the following:<br /><br /><em>Base Period (non-severable discrete work segment):</em><br />&bull; Assist NCI in contacting NAACCR representatives to obtain information about needed approvals, transfer agreements, submission file formats, and other requirements. <br />&bull; Assist NCI in obtaining IRB approvals to conduct the initial linkage with NAACCR to obtain total cancer information by state. <br />&bull; Develop data transfer agreement packages and assist NCI in obtaining data transfer approvals.<br />&bull; Develop file formats and documentation, prepare and submit to NAACCR a file of USRT study participants for linkage with the pooled virtual cancer registry. <br />&bull; Assist in reviewing returned summaries from NAACCR on numbers of cancers identified by state, and determining from which states to pursue IRB approvals. <br />&bull; Submit interim progress reports as tasks are completed and a final summary of findings that includes a recommended list of states from which detailed cancer information for individual cohort members should be pursued upon completion of all Base Period tasks.</p>
<p><em>Option I (non-severable discrete work segment):</em><br />&bull; Assist NCI/NAACCR in obtaining IRB approvals from individual states to conduct the second linkage with NAACCR to obtain individual-specific cancer information by state. <br />&bull; Pending receipt of IRB and other required clearances, prepare and submit a second cohort file to NAACCR to obtain individual-specific cancer information from selected states. <br />&bull; Receive NCI-recoded cancer validation database, and prepare a new cancer validation database "Master USRT cancer validation database" that will incorporate original and recoded cancer outcome information from self-report and medical record review, cancer information from the individual registries, and new cancer outcome variables that will be developed based on the most valid information available from each of the sources. <br />&bull; From the return file provided by NAACCR, evaluate results to ensure correct matches for individual cohort members. <br />&bull; Enter NAACCR-reported breast, thyroid, brain, and hematopoietic cancers into the Master USRT cancer validation database, compare against existing reports to identify new and previously-reported cancers, identify cancers that were previously reported but misclassified, rule out duplicates, identify cancers that were previously reported and/or medically validated but not identified from the virtual cancer registry, and, after determining decision criteria with NCI investigators, create new cancer outcome variables for the entire cohort of questionnaire responders and non-responders based on the best available information from self-report, medical record review, and cancer registries. <br />&bull; Submit preliminary cancer incidence files to NCI for review. <br />&bull; Submit a final cancer incidence file with detailed documentation. <br />&bull; Submit interim progress reports as tasks are completed and a final Option I progress report upon completion of all tasks.</p>
<p><em>Option II (non-severable discrete work segment):</em><br />&bull; Assist NCI in evaluating the accuracy of cancers that were self-reported by individual technologists. <br />&bull; Assist NCI in evaluating the completeness of the virtual cancer registry by determining which of the self-reported and/or medically validated cancers were not identified through the virtual registry linkage. <br />&bull; Work with NCI to prepare a publication-quality summary of the completeness and accuracy of self-reported cancer information before and after medical record review, and the completeness of the virtual cancer registry. <br />&bull; Submit a final progress report for Option II upon completion of all tasks.</p>

<p><br />This support services are provided by the University of Minnesota. The University of Minnesota has been under contract to the NCI since 1982 (NO1-CP-21015, N01-CP-15673, N01-CP-51016, HHSN261200900583P, N01-CP-31018, HHSN261201000139C) to conduct USRT cohort follow-up, including administering four questionnaire surveys to collect information on work history, cancer and other disease risk factors, and medical outcomes for assessing radiation-related and other risks.. Because of their direct involvement in the conduct of all aspects of the USRT study for more than 30 years, staff from the University of Minnesota (UMN) have access to and intimate knowledge of all information contained within the comprehensive USRT study database. <br />The UMN maintains personal identifying information and protected health information for all USRT study participants and is charged by the UMN and NCI Institutional Review Boards that review and approve this study to maintain the privacy and confidentiality of these data. The UMN has an established relationship with the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists (ARRT), which certifies individuals in radiography, radiotherapy, nuclear medicine and other medical radiation specialties. The USRT cohort was initially identified and has been subsequently followed through certification and annual recertification records from the ARRT. ARRT has granted UMN sole access to their historical certification and annual recertification records. As the only organization with access to both the USRT and ARRT databases, UMN is uniquely qualified to perform the tasks described in the Statement of Work for this procurement. Because of the continuing nature of this cohort, maintaining the integrity and quality of this on-going study depends on the unique performance qualifications of the current Contractor. A change in Contractors would be disruptive to the ability of the REB to analyze the study's cumulative results.</p>

This is a SOLICITATION for a non-commercial item using Simplified Acquisition Procedures under FAR Part 13, which will be posted on both FEDBIZOPPS and NECO (https://www.neco.navy.mil/). The reason for this Synopsis is to allow the Solicitation to flow to FBO.
 Per FBO requirements, a Synopsis is required per FAR 5.203 prior to issuance of any solicitation; however, since the exception in FAR 13.106-1(b) is being utilized and NOT FAR 6.302, a Synopsis need not be utilized.  Also, per FAR 5.202 (a)(13), The contracting officer need not submit the notice required by 5.201 when(a) The contracting officer determines that (13) The proposed contract action 

(i) Is for an amount not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold;

(ii) Will be made through a means that provides access to the notice of proposed contract action through the GPE; and 

(iii) Permits the public to respond to the solicitation electronically

This noncommercial under SAT Requirement falls under this exception; however, since the Solicitation was already built in NECO, a Combined Synopsis/Solicitation cannot be created.
  Per the NECO helpdesk, a recommendation to create a synopsis was suggested in order for the Solicitation to post to FBO.  

The solicitation N0060416T3111 documents and incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through FAC 2005-88 and DFARS Publication Notice 20160510.  It is the responsibility of the contractor to be familiar with the applicable clauses and provisions.  The clauses may be accessed in full text at these addresses: https://www.acquisition.gov/far/    and http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/dars/dfarspgi/current/index.html.  The proposed contract action is for non-commercial supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106(b).
  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all bids, proposals, or quotations received by the closing response date will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Provide a semi-custom rooftop air handling unit with chilled water cooling and steam heating on the roof adjacent to the penthouse.  The unit will be sized for 21,000 cfm of 100% outside air and a total of 27,000cfm to give it the ability to backup any 1 of the 5 existing air handling units.  The supply duct will be ducted into the penthouse and connect to the existing supply air duct system just upstream of the smoke damper to provide air to the system while AC-S1 is being replaced.  Steam will be piped from the penthouse out to the unit to serve the pre-heat coil.  Chilled water will be piped from the penthouse to the unit to serve the chilled water coil.

Provide a semi-custom air handling unit with chilled water cooling and steam heating and humidifier in the penthouse.  The unit will be sized for 21,295 cfm of 100% outside air to match the capacity of the unit being replaced.

<DESC>SMALL BUSINESS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE
<p>Agency/office:  Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services <br /> Office of Acquisition &amp; Grants Management<br /> Information Technology Contracts Group<br /> Health Insurance General Ledger Accounting System (HIGLAS) Recompete<br /> Action No. HHSM500-2016-RFI-170457; HIGLAS Hosting, Operations &amp;Maintenance Contractor<br />Classification Code: D318- IT-Integrated Hardware/Software/and related services, where  Services are the Predominant Portion of the Contract Value.<br />NAICS Code:  518210 - Data Processing, Hosting, and Related Services.<br />Response Date: Tuesday-June 7, 2016</p>
<p><br />Description:</p>
<p>This is a SMALL BUSINESS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE. This is not a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.  The purpose of this notice is to obtain  information regarding: 1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; 2) whether there are any small businesses, HUBZONE small businesses, service-disabled small businesses, 8(a) small businesses, woman-owned small businesses, or small disadvantaged businesses; and their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition, in accordance with FAR 7.104(d).  Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method.  An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code 518210 should not submit a response to this notice. This action is HHSM500-2016-RFI-170457. This is NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL/REQUEST FOR QUOTE.</p>
<p>THIS NOTICE IS STRICTLY MARKET RESEARCH. CMS WILL NOT ENTERTAIN QUESTIONS REGARDING THE RESULTS OF THE MARKET RESEARCH.</p>
<p>Purpose:</p>
<p>Small business(es) will need to demonstrate the ability to independently provide the necessary capacity, staffing, knowledge, aptitudes, expertise, and facilities to accomplish the work requirements outlined within the enclosed performance work statement.  The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), Office of Financial Management (OFM), Financial Management Systems Group (FMSG), is looking for small business(es) capable of acting as the HIGLAS Hosting, Operations &amp; Maintenance (HOM) Contractor.  This sources sought notice addresses the three separate but integrated work streams:</p>
<p>1.	Hosting of the application code, entitlement accounting and payment processing, and payments database. HIGLAS is a FISMA-High system and no cloud solution is acceptable.<br />2.	Operations, consisting of performing daily, monthly, quarterly, and annual federal accounting functions and reporting, as well as performing payment processing with 99.95% system availability. There is also a significant requirement for performance of enterprise security.<br />3.	Maintenance, of the application code through quarterly release process, addressing break-fixes, and off-cycle changes necessitated by legislation or policy.</p>
<p>In addition, CMS may require additional ad-hoc hosting, operating, and maintenance tasks, and the small business contractor must be able to address increased needs efficiently.  Therefore, prospective small businesses are advised to make plans which could accommodate additional storage and increased data processing/transmission , if additional CMS customer(s) requirements were to be added at a future date.</p>
<p>HIGLAS Transitions, would commence November 15, 2016, and continue thru February 28, 2017. The three month transition period will be followed by a twelve (12) month production base period. There would be up to six additional option periods, each consisting of twelve (12) months-and each exercisable at the discretion of the Government</p>
<p>It is anticipated that any eventual contract would consist of a hybrid-type contract, under which there would be firm-fixed price and cost-plus-fixed-fee line items would be issued - depending upon the nature of the work and the inherent risks. Any HOM prime contractors must be operating with a Government-approved and audited accounting system.</p>
<p>NAICS Code: HIGLAS Hosting, Operations&amp; Maintenance Contractor = 518210 (Data Processing, Hosting, &amp; Related Services.</p>
<p>History:</p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is under direction to reduce the costs of operation. <br />1.	 In 2003, CMS issued contract no. 500-03-0014 to IBM Global Services (IBM) to develop and operate the new HIGLAS Solution. The contract was issued as an indefinite delivery - indefinite quantity contract, under which annual task orders were issued. The incumbent contract expired February 27, 2013.</p>
<p>Under that contract, with CMS direction, IBM provides system life-cycle management, engineering, development, integration,  and operational support of the primary Medicare financial database, control, and dual-entry accounting system-that supports both the claims processing and accounting functions required to administer health insurance programs for all Medicare Parts A-B-C-D, Medicaid, and the Children's Health Insurance Program.  The primary HIGLAS objective was to leverage commercial off-the-shelf software, in order to increase automation and efficiencies, in order to maximize economies, while eliminating redundant and inefficient/ineffective manual processes. The backbone of the HIGLAS system is Oracle Federal Financials, Release R11 product, with custom bridge code to various predecessor CMS financial systems. The HIGLAS Program Office was established to implement financial and accounting reform for CMS.  The HIGLAS system represents the CMS portion of DHHS effort to standardize accounting efforts for over 21% of total federal government outlays. It leverages a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solution for CMS to: <br />-	Standardize and retain a clean CFO audit opinion, and<br />-	Resolve material weaknesses in financial systems/processes including CMS general and applications controls.</p>
<p><br />2.	The HIGLAS solution was divided into two segments and was re-competed in 2012, under the GSA ALLIANT GWAC. Contract HHSM500-2012-00172G for Application Code Maintenance was awarded to CSRA, and separate contract HHSM500-2012-00161G was awarded to IBM-Federal for Hosting and Operations. The incumbent staffs include Oracle Subject Matter Experts(SMEs), Certified Public Accountants (CPAs), Financial Analysts, Data Analysts, Information Technology SMEs, Program Managers, Operations Managers, Configuration Control Specialists, Architects, Developers, Network Engineers, Systems Engineers, Testers, System Administrators, Data Base Administrators, Security, Quality, Risk Management Experts, Procurement, Technical Writers, and others. As non-severable special projects, in 2014, the application code was successfully upgraded to Oracle 12.2, and the database definition was upgraded to Oracle 12C.</p>
<p>At present, the HIGLAS production process system operates 24x7 including scheduled system maintenance. On average, HIGLAS processes approximately 4.5 Million claims transactions daily, which amount to over 1.2 billion transactions annually, acting as the system-of-record for all Medicare Parts A, B, C, D, Medicaid, and Children's Health Insurance plan payments nationally. HIGLAS creates  186,000 payments daily, which approximate $1.5 Billion.  The HIGLAS system runs 200,000 reports or ad hoc queries daily. These numbers will increase steadily through CY2016-2017. There are currently about 4,000 active users accessing the production environment.</p>
<p>Additional accounting functionality has been, and continues to be, added. The CMS HIGLAS system performs daily cycles, month-end and year-end reconciliations, compiles tax-forms data, and is to report CMS composite financial results to the Dept. of Health and Human Services, via the Unified Financial Management System (UFMS). <br />HIGLAS processes the mission-critical payment calculations for Medicare benefits to Part A-Part B, Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs), Medicaid Grants, and CHIP (Children's Health Insurance Program) Grants for the entire nation. HIGLAS also performs internal CMS administrative program accounting transactions for the entire agency.<br />HIGLAS supports: <br />-	Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA)<br />-	Federal Managers Integrity Act (FMFIA)<br />-	Federal Payment Levy Program (FPLP) from the TIPRA<br />-	OMB Circular A-123<br />-	OMB Circular A-127 (Financial Management Systems)<br />-	Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) program</p>
<p>IBM-Federal currently maintains a primary data center located within an IBM facility in Boulder, CO. There is a disaster recovery plan in effect and a secondary/back-up data center located in another facility in San Jose, CA.</p>

<DESC>Sources Sought Synopsis
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY The Government is currently conducting market research to gather information and identify potential sources for the requirement identified below. A solicitation is not available at this time, and requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. This notice does not constitute a commitment by the United States Government.</p>
<p>NOAA's Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, Western Acquisition Division-Boulder, in support of the Earth System Research Laboratory, Global Monitoring Division seeks potential vendors for a two room shelter. Depending on the materials and type of construction used, the facility may be one larger or multiple smaller buildings. The facility will be located in a corrosive marine environment and must be able to withstand the local conditions (salt corrosion and heavy rain and winds up to 70mph). Certain construction materials will be prohibited from use because they emit gases that are measured by the highly sensitive instrumentation inside the building. Primarily, these are halogenated gases used in adhesives and insulation. Access limitations at the site, including a narrow gravel road, require the facility to be assembled on-site or be comprised of smaller prefabricated structures. Finally, it is desirable for the facility to blend with the environment as much as possible (colors) and to be low profile and be largely out of sight behind the tree line. Building Size: The total interior footprint of the facility should be 630 to 700 square feet. Exterior building height (including roof) should be minimized to the extent possible and must accommodate interior ceiling heights of 8' plus roof insulation. Location: Trinidad Head Observatory, 95570 zip code.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS FOR WRITTEN INFORMATION ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT AND ANY FOLLOW-UP REQUESTS.  NO TELEPHONE CALLS REQUESTING A SOLICITATION WILL BE ACCEPTED OR ACKNOWLEDGED. 

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is performing market research to identify the capabilities of firms that can provide support to the EPA's Office of Water with section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA).  The CWA section 404 regulatory program permits a wide range of projects which impact waters of the US.  Under section 404 the US Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) or states who have assumed the permit program issue the permits in compliance with regulations established by the EPA.  EPA reviews public notices for proposed projects and policies, approves assumption of permit program and works with the US Army Corps of Engineers and states on ways to more efficiently and effectively implement the 404 program.  The permit review criteria for the 404 program are laid out in regulations referred to as the 404(b)(1) Guidelines (see http://www.epa.gov/cwa-404/section-404b1-guidlines-40-cfr-230).  

One of the key components of the Guidelines is the review of projects for additional potential avoidance and minimization of impacts to waters of the US.  Identifying and comparing project-specific opportunities for additional avoidance and minimization often requires advanced technical knowledge of the design and implementation of the proposed activities.  Given the complexity of some of these projects and proposals, EPA is seeking technical expertise for the review of proposed activities requiring authorization under CWA section 404.  Common activities under review include transportation infrastructure development, residential and commercial developments, and mineral and coal mines and facilities.  Based on the circumstances of the proposed project and impacts, review of these projects may focus on the identification of jurisdictional waters on site; direct impacts to aquatic resources; effects on the physical, chemical, and biological integrity of downstream waters; and/or secondary and cumulative environmental impacts.

It is anticipated that the contract will be an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) single award contract with firm fixed price and time and materials task orders with an ordering period of 5 years.  Approximately 25,500 hours are anticipated for the ordering period. The applicable NAICS code is 541620 Â¿Environmental Consulting ServicesÂ¿ with a size standard of $15 million in average annual receipts. In the capabilities statements, contractors must provide their size status for the above referenced NAICS code, (i.e. large, small) and whether or not they are a certified hub zone, 8(a), women owned, small disadvantaged and/or service disabled veteran owned concern.  EPA intends to set this action aside 100% for small businesses.  As a reminder, small businesses are required to perform at least 50 percent of the costs of the contract performance with their own personnel (See FAR 52.219 14) under a procurement set aside for small businesses.  

A draft copy of the performance work statement (PWS) is included as an attachment. Interested parties with the capability of providing any of the services described in the draft PWS posted at the FedConnect website: https://www.fedconnect.net/ are invited to submit a document (maximum 5 pages), in writing, sufficient information that clearly demonstrates their ability to provide the services described in the draft PWS, including personnel, experience and qualifications. A description of similar services previously or currently provided shall be provided.  Standard company brochures will not be considered a sufficient response to this Sources Sought Synopsis. 

Capabilities Statements in response to this Sources Sought Synopsis MUST BE SUBMITTED THROUGH THE FEDCONNECT PORTAL by 4:00 p.m. EDT, on June 26, 2016.  Any questions regarding the content of this sources sought synopsis announcement must be submitted through the FedConnect portal. You must register with FedConnect to submit documents, questions, and to view responses. FedConnect can be accessed at https://www.fedconnect.net/Fedconnect/. FedConnect is a web portal that connects agencies and vendors to streamline the process of doing business with the federal government. Through FedConnect contractors will be able to receive, review and respond to contract pre- and post-award actions and documents such as correspondence, request for proposals, tasking instruments and contract modifications. The use of FedConnect also furthers the EPA's commitment to moving towards a paperless acquisition environment by reducing its carbon footprint and conducting its business in an ecologically friendly manner. There is no charge to use FedConnect. Vendors can register with FedConnect at www.fedconnect.net/FedConnect/. For assistance in registering or for other FedConnect technical questions please call the FedConnect Help Desk at (800) 899-6665 or email at support@fedconnect.net. In addition, all vendors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM), as this facilitates registration for FedConnect.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS. No proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis.
<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Seattle District is seeking information regarding capability and availability of potential contractors to perform a Firm Fixed Price Contract to furnish, install, commission, and place in service the DC and Preferred AC system at the Chief Joseph Dam Powerhouse in Bridgeport, WA.</p>
<p>The purpose of this notice is to measure the interest of Small Businesses (SB), 8(a), Woman Owned Small Business (WOSB), Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), or HUBZone prime contractor business sources and their size classifications relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 238210 "Electrical Contractors and Other Wiring Installation Contractors" (Size Standard of $15 Million) for the subject opportunity.</p>
<p>Background and Summary Scope of Work (SOW):</p>
<p>The Chief Joseph Powerhouse was constructed on the Columbia River in Washington between 1956 and 1961. The Powerhouse originally had 16 generating units, and was expanded between 1973 and 1979 with 11 additional generating units. Power is generated at 13.8kV and transformed to 230kV and 500kV for transmission to the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA). Critical power for generator controls and life safety are provided by a combination of the following battery and inverter systems: (a) 125 Volt DC System No. 1 and 2. (b) 125/250 volt DC System No. 3. (c). 24/48 Volt DC System No. 4. (d) Preferred AC System. The Chief Joseph Powerhouse has four separate DC systems and one single Preferred AC system. One DC system provides 125 volt DC critical control power to Units 1 -16 power production equipment and the other 125 volt DC system feeds Units 17-27. The 125/250 volt DC system feeds station service, emergency lighting, and large loads required for black start capability. The 24/48 volt DC system provides power for SCC indicating lights and spillway SCADA. All equipment in these systems is original construction (Units 1-16 are over 50 years old and Units 17-27 are over 30 year old), with the exception of the storage battery banks which were replaced in the mid 1990's.</p>
<p>The DC and Preferred AC distribution system has become antiquated and difficult to maintain due to the shortage of contemporary replacement parts. The demand load has also grown to the limits of the existing equipment. The current DC distribution configuration relies on a single source, rather than on redundant sources now embraced as regional station service design philosophy. The existing battery chargers, AC and DC feeders, and battery switchboard circuit breaker protections are undersized for the current battery capacity and the existing switchboards are not compliant with current life safety standards. The panel breakers in the individual unit switchboards for units 1-16 are undersized and parts are no longer available from the original equipment manufacturer. The battery room auxiliary equipment (ventilation, alarms, and monitoring), is not up to present safety codes and design standards and current battery capacity exceeds current charger capacity.</p>
<p>This project will procure and install a set of upgrades including four 125 VDC battery banks and two 24 volt DC battery banks, each with two redundant chargers and two switchboards. Also included will be two new 120VAC switchboards, redundant inverters, a new annunciator panel, hydrogen gas detector, power terminal box, battery monitoring system, appropriate enclosures for the systems, cable reducing boxes, exhaust fans and DC emergency lights. The individual switchboards will be incorporated into one master battery switchboard.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTS:<br />Interested firms should submit a capabilities package, to include the following:<br />1. Firm's name, address (mailing and URL), point of contact, phone number, email address.<br />2. Business classification, i.e., Small Business (SB), Small Disadvantage Business (SDB), Woman-Owned Small Business (WOSB), Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Small Business, 8(a) Program, or Other Than Small Business (large business).<br />3. Two (2) examples of past projects valued over $2,000,000.00 and completed within the last ten years with electrical experience installing 125 volt DC station battery banks with chargers and switchboards and replacing 120 volt AC inverters and boards at a powerhouse or similar industrial facility. At least one project shall demonstrate contractor's ability to cutover while keeping critical systems energized through construction.</p>
<p>Examples should include the following information:<br />a. A description of the project, customer name, timeliness of performance, customer satisfaction, and dollar value of each project;</p>
<p>4. CAGE Code and DUNS number.<br />5. Firm's Joint Venture Information, if applicable.<br />6. Bonding Information:<br />a. Provide the following, on the bonding company's letterhead:<br />(1) Bonding Limits<br />(a) Single Bond<br />(b) Aggregate</p>
<p>All interested parties who believe they can meet the requirements are invited to submit, in writing, complete information describing their interest and ability to meet all requirements stated above.</p>
<p>Prior Government contract work is not required for submitting a response under this Sources Sought Announcement.</p>
<p>The official Synopsis citing a solicitation number will be issued on Federal Business Opportunities (www.fbo.gov) inviting firms to register electronically to receive an electronic notification of a solicitation should one be issued.</p>

<RESPDATE>071516
<CONTACT>Reginald O. Solomon, Contracting Officer, Email whs.ncr.ad.mbx.deca-privatization-info@mail.mil
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI). This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The information gained will assist in developing a plan to privatize all or portions of the Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA) and Defense Commissary System through the Office of the Deputy Chief Management Officer (ODCMO) (http://dcmo.defense.gov/). <br /><br />The result of this market research will contribute to determining the method of procurement (if any). The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this procurement is 445110.
<p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION <br />To this end, the WHS Acquisition Directorate is seeking the following information from interested companies with respect to the following items/questions:<br /><br />1. Identify which of the tasks above your business concern already performs (with respect to grocery store operations, support, and management).<br /><br />2. Could your business concern fully perform these tasks in lieu of the DeCA, or would you need to partner with one or more other business concerns to fully perform these tasks?<br /><br />3. Could your business concern perform the tasks without subsidy from the Government and still maintain the savings to patrons and the quality of both product and service?<br /><br />4. What is your organization's optimal operating model with respect to full support, as outlined in Section I, or partial support, as outlined in Section II?<br /><br />5. Describe any challenges, issues, and constraints that your business concern perceives may exist that would hamper its ability to operate any or all of the Defense Commissary System or to operate in a military environment.<br /><br />6. Would your business concern be willing to provide an agreed upon level of savings to authorized patrons for the products and services of the current commissary system (in lieu of commissaries remaining open)?<br />a. How would you implement?<br />b. What percentage savings might your concern prepared to offer?<br /><br />7. Describe innovative and/or alternative approaches to commissary operations that your business concern could offer that might reduce appropriated fund support while maintaining savings and service. Address whether an approach would require legislative change in order to implement. Some examples might be:<br />a. Provision of groceries in remote locations using smaller (or no) storefronts, eCommerce, and direct-to-door (delivery) services.<br />b. Coupon/discount programs leveraging eCommerce that link directly to patron credit cards.<br />c. Implementation of a grocerant concept in targeted commissaries.<br /><br />8. What is your business concern's willingness to adopt the current commissary <br />employee structure, in addition to retaining the current employees? <br /><br />9. What is your business concern's willingness to offer a preferential hiring program for veterans and military family members?<br /><br />10. Would your business concern expect to assume control of or responsibility for the existing physical infrastructure? <br />a. Under what conditions would you do that? <br />b. Describe your organization's preference to engage in either a Government Owned-Contractor Operated (GOCO) or a Contractor Owned-Contractor Operated (COCO) relationship, with regard to facilities?<br /><br />11. What specialty categories can your business concern offer (i.e., deli, bakery, prepared foods)?<br /><br />12. What types of loyalty programs can your business concern offer? <br /><br />13. How would your business concern use business analytics to improve the quality of products and services offered to authorized patrons or to increase patronage?<br /><br />14. How would your business concern address generational (e.g., Millennials, Generation Z) impacts through products and services targeted to increase patronage (particularly among junior enlisted members and their families), customer satisfaction, and/or sales?<br /><br />15. Use the table at Appendix A to indicate your organization's desired composition of commissary functions.</p>

<DESC>It is incumbent upon the offeror to review this DRAFT Request For Proposal (RFP) in its entirety. Proposals are NOT to be submitted as a result of this DRAFT RFP.
<p>US Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground Edgewood Division (ACC-APG ED) on the behalf of the Joint Program Manager Information Systems (JPM IS) intends to post solicitation W911SR-16-R-0006 for the Joint Effects Model (JEM) on or around 30 July 2016, with proposals due 45 days thereafter. NAICS Code IS 541511.</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is for the development and integration of existing and new software capability to model and simulate the effects of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) weapon strikes and Toxic Industrial Chemical/Toxic Industrial Material (TIC/TIM) incidents.  The primary objective of the JEM contract is to support software research and development, and integration, upgrade, modernization and sustainment to advance an intelligent Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Warfare infrastructure.</p>
<p>The contractor will work in a team-based Agile environment. The Agency will create and maintain system roadmaps, project plans, and product and release backlogs that will be the basis for the contractor's work. The Product Owner will specify high-level requirements to the Agile team. As in typical Scrum-based Agile processes, the Agency Product Owner will work together with the team to develop and estimate user stories and establish acceptance criteria. These acceptance criteria will specify expected functionality for a user story, as well as any non-functional requirements that must be met in the development of the story. The Agency Product Owner, supported by SMEs and business analysts, will determine whether or not acceptance criteria have been satisfied.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates utilizing both Cost-Plus-Award-Fee (CPAF) and Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) for software development and sustainment services on a Level of Effort (LOE) basis. The Government intends to award a single Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Requirements type contract with the first Task Order concurrently awarded for the first year of services, with a one (1) year option.</p>
<p>All questions on the draft RFP shall be submitted via email to lenore.y.paseda.civ@mail.mil and david.j.shriner.civ@mail.mil no later than 4:00 PM Eastern Time on June 6, 2016.

<p><br /><br />Section C - Descriptions and Specifications</p>
<p>CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT</p>
<p><br />SUP 5252.204-9400 Contractor Unclassified Access to Federally Controlled Facilities, Sensitive Information, Information Technology (IT) Systems or Protected Health Information (July 2013)</p>
<p>Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, requires government agencies to develop and implement Federal security standards for Federal employees and contractors. The Deputy Secretary of Defense Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-006 - "DoD Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive - 12 (HSPD-12)" dated November 26, 2008 (or its subsequent DoD instruction) directs implementation of HSPD-12. This clause is in accordance with HSPD-12 and its implementing directives.</p>
<p>APPLICABILITY <br />This clause applies to contractor employees requiring physical access to any area of a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoN or DoD computer/network/system to perform certain unclassified sensitive duties. This clause also applies to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information, provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified by DON as National Security Position, as advised by the command security manager. It is the responsibility of the responsible security officer of the command/facility where the work is performed to ensure compliance.</p>
<p>Each contractor employee providing services at a Navy Command under this contract is required to obtain a Department of Defense Common Access Card (DoD CAC). Additionally, depending on the level of computer/network access, the contract employee will require a successful investigation as detailed below.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO FEDERAL FACILITIES <br />Per HSPD-12 and implementing guidance, all contractor employees working at a federally controlled base, facility or activity under this clause will require a DoD CAC. When access to a base, facility or activity is required contractor employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Navy Command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO DOD IT SYSTEMS <br />In accordance with SECNAV M-5510.30, contractor employees who require access to DoN or DoD networks are categorized as IT-I, IT-II, or IT-III. The IT-II level, defined in detail in SECNAV M-5510.30, includes positions which require access to information protected under the Privacy Act, to include Protected Health Information (PHI). All contractor employees under this contract who require access to Privacy Act protected information are therefore categorized no lower than IT-II. IT Levels are determined by the requiring activity's Command Information Assurance Manager. Contractor employees requiring privileged or IT-I level access, (when specified by the terms of the contract) require a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) which is a higher level investigation than the National Agency Check with Law and Credit (NACLC) described below. Due to the privileged system access, a SSBI suitable for High Risk public trusts positions is required. Individuals who have access to system control, monitoring, or administration functions (e.g. system administrator, database administrator) require training and certification to Information Assurance Technical Level 1, and must be trained and certified on the Operating System or Computing Environment they are required to maintain.</p>
<p>Access to sensitive IT systems is contingent upon a favorably adjudicated background investigation. When access to IT systems is required for performance of the contractor employee's duties, such employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The decision to authorize access to a government IT system/network is inherently governmental. The contractor supervisor is not authorized to sign the SAAR-Ni therefore, the government employee with knowledge of the system/network access required or the COR shall sign the SAAR-N as the "supervisor".</p>
<p>The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date.</p>
<p>When required to maintain access to required IT systems or networks, the contractor shall ensure that all employees requiring access complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>INTERIM ACCESS <br />The Navy Command' s Security Manager may authorize issuance of a DoD CAC and interim access to a DoN or DoD unclassified computer/network upon a favorable review of the investigative questionnaire and advance favorable fingerprint results. When the results of the investigation are received and a favorable determination is not made, the contractor employee working on the contract under interim access will be denied access to the computer network and this denial will not relieve the contractor of his/her responsibility to perform.</p>
<p>DENIAL OR TERMINATION OF ACCESS <br />The potential consequences of any requirement under this clause including denial or termination of physical or system access in no way relieves the contractor from the requirement to execute performance under the contract within the timeframes specified in the contract. Contractors shall plan ahead in processing their employees and subcontractor employees. The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is permitted to have unclassified access to a federally controlled facility, federally-controlled information system/network and/or to government information, meaning information not authorized for public release.</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR'S SECURITY REPRESENTATIVE <br />The contractor shall designate an employee to serve as the Contractor's Security Representative. Within three work days after contract award, the contractor shall provide to the requiring activity's Security Manager and the Contracting Officer, in writing, the name, title, address and phone number for the Contractor's Security Representative. The Contractor's Security Representative shall be the primary point of contact on any security matter. The Contractor's Security Representative shall not be replaced or removed without prior notice to the Contracting Officer and Command Security Manager.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO NATIONAL SECURITY POSITIONS OR PERFORMING SENSITIVE DUTIES <br />Navy security policy requires that all positions be given a sensitivity value based on level of risk factors to ensure appropriate protective measures are applied. Navy recognizes contractor employees under this contract as Non-Critical Sensitive [ADP/IT-II] when the contract scope of work require physical access to a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoD computer/network, to perform unclassified sensitive duties. This designation is also applied to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information (PHI), provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified by DON as National Security Positions. At a minimum, each contractor employee must be a US citizen and have a favorably completed NACLC to obtain a favorable determination for assignment to a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position. The NACLC consists of a standard NAC and a FBI fingerprint check plus law enforcement checks and credit check. Each contractor employee filling a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position is required to complete:</p>
<p>* SF-86 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (or equivalent OPM investigative product) <br />* Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission) <br />* Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. Background investigations shall be reinitiated as required to ensure investigations remain current (not older than 10 years) throughout the contract performance period. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>Regardless of their duties or IT access requirements ALL contractor employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Employees requiring IT access shall also check-in and check-out with the Navy Command's Information Assurance Manager. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date.</p>
<p>The contractor shall ensure that each contract employee requiring access to IT systems or networks complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. Contractor employees shall accurately complete the required investigative forms prior to submission to the Navy Command Security Manager. The Navy Command's Security Manager will review the submitted documentation for completeness prior to submitting it to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Suitability/security issues identified by the Navy may render the contractor employee ineligible for the assignment. An unfavorable determination made by the Navy is final (subject to SF-86 appeal procedures) and such a determination does not relieve the contractor from meeting any contractual obligation under the contract. The Navy Command's Security Manager will forward the required forms to OPM for processing. Once the investigation is complete, the results will be forwarded by OPM to the DON Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) for a determination.</p>
<p>If the contractor employee already possesses a current favorably adjudicated investigation, the contractor shall submit a Visit Authorization Request (VAR) via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) or a hard copy VAR directly from the contractor's Security Representative. Although the contractor will take JPAS "Owning" role over the contractor employee, the Navy Command will take JPAS "Servicing" role over the contractor employee during the hiring process and for the duration of assignment under that contract. The contractor shall include the IT Position Category per SECNAV M-5510.30 for each employee designated on a VAR. The VAR requires annual renewal for the duration of the employee's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO OR PERFORMING NON-SENSITIVE DUTIES <br />Contractor employee whose work is unclassified and non-sensitive (e.g., performing certain duties such as lawn maintenance, vendor services, etc ...) and who require physical access to publicly accessible areas to perform those duties shall meet the following minimum requirements:</p>
<p>* Must be either a US citizen or a US permanent resident with a minimum of 3 years legal residency in the United States (as required by The Deputy Secretary of Defense DTM 08-006 or its subsequent DoD instruction) and <br />* Must have a favorably completed National Agency Check with Written Inquiries (NACI) including a FBI fingerprint check prior to installation access.</p>
<p>To be considered for a favorable trustworthiness determination, the Contractor's Security Representative must submit for all employees each of the following:</p>
<p>* SF-85 Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions <br />* Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission) <br />* Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>The contractor shall ensure each individual employee has a current favorably completed National Agency Check with Written Inquiries (NACI) or ensure successful FBI fingerprint results have been gained and investigation has been processed with OPM.</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date.</p>
<p>* Consult with your Command Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager for local policy when IT-III (non-sensitive) access is required for non-US citizens outside the United States.<br /><br />Section E - Inspection and Acceptance</p>

<DESC>Proposers' Day Conference
<p>The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) will host a Proposers' Day Conference for the Fun GCAT program on 28 June 2016 in anticipation of the release of a new solicitation.  The Conference will be held from 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM EDT in the Washington, DC metropolitan area.  The purpose of the conference will be to provide information on Fun GCAT and the research problems the program aims to address, to address questions from potential proposers, and to provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.</p>
<p>The Fun GCAT program intends to develop better approaches and tools for characterization and analysis of biological threats based on gene function. Currently, threats are organized based on genetic relatedness, resulting in static, threat-based lists that fail to emphasize biological functions. In order to better characterize known threats, and improve our capacity to understand the relative risk posed by new and emerging threats, the Fun GCAT program will seek to characterize biological threats from a functional perspective and will seek to develop new and better computational and bioinformatics tools to analyze biological data, predict structure/function relationships, and ascribe a relative risk potential to unknown genes.</p>

<DESC>Proposers' Day Conference
<p>The world's oceans carry 90% of global trade and key waterways such as the Strait of Hormuz and Strait of Malacca carry up to 35% and 25% of the world's seaborne oil shipments, respectively. Disruption of critical U.S. ports can rapidly impose a cost of billions of dollars per day. And while these Sea Lines of Communication (SLOCs) are a vital economic avenue, they are also exploited for malign interests including international terrorism, drug trafficking, illegal immigration, worldwide trafficking of women and children, illicit transfer of materials for weapons of mass destruction, and arms trafficking. Several high-profile and/or recent maritime concerns include al-Qaeda's attack on the USS Cole, Somali pirate activity in the Gulf of Aden, mass migration across the Mediterranean, the seizure of semi-submersible "drug subs", the interdiction of an illicit arms shipment aboard the North Korean vessel Chong Chon Gang, and the Tanker War in the Persian Gulf. Maritime security is a multi-faceted topic that intersects many diverse components of the U.S. Intelligence Community including those embedded within the Department of State, Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security (e.g. Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the U.S. Coast Guard), the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Energy, the Department of Treasury, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Department of Commerce.</p>
<p>IARPA's UnderWatch program seeks to develop an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV)-based maritime reconnaissance capability that will allow unobtrusive surveillance of vessel traffic in critical harbors, waterways, and chokepoints. Analogous to the DoD's concept of "overwatch," the UnderWatch system will leverage a unique vantage point (the undersea environment) to monitor ships and maneuver to inspect contacts of interest. UnderWatch must necessarily have an organic sensing capability to observe traffic at long range, with applicability to a broad set of vessel types such as container ships, cruise ships, commercial fishing traffic, recreational vessels, go-fast boats, and Self-Propelled Semi-Submersibles (SPSSs). The UnderWatch system will enable remote surveillance of critical waterways in support of broad interests in the maritime domain.</p>

<DESC>The Uniformed Services University (USU) is the Nation's Federal health sciences university and we are committed to excellence in military medicine and public health during peace and war.  We provide the Nation with health professionals dedicated to career service in the Department of Defense (DoD) and the United States Public Health Service (PHS) and with scientists who serve the common good.  We serve the uniformed services and the Nation as an outstanding academic health sciences center with a worldwide perspective for education, research, service, and consultation; we are unique in relating these activities to military medicine, disaster medicine, and military medical readiness.  USU is located in Bethesda, MD on the grounds of the Naval Support Activity Bethesda.
<p>The USU intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with EMD Millipore Corporation to upgrade existing Millipore ImageStreamX Mark II.</p>
<p>This upgrade will be procured in accordance with the procedures of FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.</p>
<p>Sole source determination is made in accordance with:</p>
<p>FAR subpart 13.106-1 Soliciting Competition<br />(b) Soliciting from a single source.<br />(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available.</p>
<p>The mission of USU is to provide the highest quality education programs in the health sciences to those selected individuals who demonstrate dedication to a health profession career in the Uniformed Services.  As such, it is essential USU provide the necessary training and equipment required for our students to become successful doctors and nurses and to be able to provide the best care possible for our soldiers and to support our research efforts.</p>
<p>Millipore ImageStream X Mark II is a high-resolution microscope for suspended cells.  USU Departments of Pediatrics, Surgery, Pathology, and Microbiology all use this instrument and they have the need to extend the number of fluorochromes for increased detection.  Currently the instrument has 2 lasers for excitation and 6 channels for bright field and emission detection.  USU plans to expand the number of lasers for excitation by installing a 405nm camera and the number of detection channels to 12 with an additional camera.  This upgrade is proprietary to EMD Millipore Corp. and no third-party company is authorized to provide this requirement by EMD Millipore Corp.</p>
<p>EMD Millipore Corp. is the only known source that can fulfill our requirement.</p>
<p>This is not a Request for Quote (RFQ) and a solicitation package will not be issued.  Sources interested in responding to this requirement must be able to provide compelling evidence that they can provide the abovementioned requirement as specified.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contractual action based upon responses received is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Responses must be submitted via email to andrew.lee@usushs.edu by 10:00PM EST on June 10, 2016.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-91)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />Email: OPAP@uscg.mil<br />Fax: 202-372-8447<br />Phone: 202-475-5786</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<p>FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATION -- COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2014)</p>
<p>The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.<br />***Past performance is significantly more important than price.***</p>
<p><br />The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>1. Past Performance</p>
<p>(a) The Government will evaluate the offerors past performance information for quality and confidence. The offeror shall identify at least two relevant (dining and lodging) and current federal, state or local government or private contracts performed during the last three (3) years.</p>
<p>If subcontracting arrangement is proposed, the above data must also be provided for each first tier subcontractor. If a joint effort or teaming arrangement is proposed, highlight previous experience with the proposed team or subcontractor.</p>
<p>The past performance evaluation will take into account the guidelines outlined at FAR 15.305(a) (2). The quality of past performance and relevance of experience to the Coast Guard will be evaluated. The ability to manage and maintain a qualified workforce will be considered. Customer satisfaction will be an integral consideration. In evaluating past performance the Government will consider contracts performed during the last 3 years. Emphasis will be placed upon the contractor's administration of the contractual responsibilities. For example:</p>
<p>(1) Adequacy of contract start up. <br />(2) Performance in accordance with proposed method of performance. <br />(3) Sufficiency of proposed personnel to perform contract. <br />(4) Filling of key positions with qualified individuals. <br />(5) Quality performance of work. <br />(6) Response to emergency situations. <br />(7) Schedule adherence (including administrative aspects of performance.) <br />(8) Responsiveness to Government requirements. <br />(9) Performance in accordance with contract requirements. <br />(10) Customer satisfaction. <br />(11) Complete submittals. <br />(12) Timely delivery of paperwork. <br />(13) Timely and accurate invoice submittals <br />(14) Knowledge of Customer Requirements and Expectations. <br />(15) Management and cost control of subcontracts</p>
<p>Following the quality evaluation, the Government will assign an overall confidence rating to each past performance reference, considering both the relevance and quality of the provided reference. The Government will then assign a composite past performance confidence rating for the vendor's overall past performance, considering the confidence ratings assigned to each individual reference. The confidence evaluation will be in accordance with the following table</p>
<p>Past Performance Quality Rating:<br />Rating Definition<br />Exceptional Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds many to the Government's benefit. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being evaluated was accomplished with few minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were highly effective.<br />Very Good Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds some to the Government's benefit. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being evaluated was accomplished with some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were effective.<br />Satisfactory Performance meets contractual requirements. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element contains some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor appear or were satisfactory.</p>
<p>Marginal Performance does not meet some contractual requirements. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being evaluated reflects a serious problem for which the contractor has not yet identified corrective actions. The contractor's proposed actions appear only marginally effective or were not fully implemented.<br />Unsatisfactory Performance does not meet most contractual requirements and recovery is not likely in a timely manner. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element contains a serious problem(s) for which the contractor's corrective actions appear or were ineffective.<br />Neutral The offeror has no past performance history OR the Contracting Officer has determined that the past performance information provided is not directly related or similar to the requirements in the RFP</p>
<p>(b) The Government may review Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) ratings <br />on relevant contracts and may also consider Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) <br />ratings, regulatory agency databases, past performance questionnaires, information submitted by each <br />Offeror with its quote, and other existing past performance information contained in either local or <br />other supervisor files, or from other Government sources or non-Government sources. Offerors are <br />advised that in evaluating an Offeror's past performance, the Government may, in its sole discretion, <br />consider information from sources outside the Offeror's quote. For example, the Government may <br />consider information based on its own experience with the Offeror and/or may contact the parties for <br />whom the Offeror performed contracts and consider their response when evaluating the Offeror's <br />quote. General trends in a contractor's performance will also be considered. In the case of an Offeror <br />without a record of relevant past performance, or for whom information on past performance is not <br />available, they will not receive a favorable or unfavorable rating.</p>
<p>The assessment of the Offeror's Past Performance is one of the factors used for evaluating the <br />Offeror's ability to successfully perform the requirements of this solicitation as well as to determine <br />the Offeror's performance risk for the subject solicitation. Such consideration is separate and distinct <br />from the Contracting Officer's responsibility determination under FAR 9. The Government reserves <br />the right to contact references provided by the Offeror, and otherwise verify statements and <br />representations made in the Offeror's quote, but reserves the right not to contact.</p>
<p>2. Price</p>
<p>The total price of the offeror will be determined by totaling the proposed prices of all the Definite Items. Offeror's price shall represent the best price in response to the request for quotes. The price shall be evaluated to determine fairness and reasonableness.</p>
<p>Price quote will be reviewed for completeness and reasonableness.</p>
<p>A written notice of award or acceptance of a quote mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful quoter within the time for acceptance specified in the quote, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the quote's specified expiration time, the Government may accept a quote (or part of a quote), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. <br /><br />This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-87-2.<br /><br />The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541990 - All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services. The small business size standard is $15.0M. This acquisition is 100% set-aside for small businesses. Simplified acquisition procedures will be utilized.<br /><br /><strong><em>Background Information</em></strong><br /><br />The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Information Technology Laboratory's (ITL) Information Access Division's Retrieval Group works with industry, academia, and other government agencies to promote the use of more effective and efficient techniques for manipulating information not specifically structured for automatic use--especially the browsing, searching, and presentation of that information. Accurate evaluation of the capabilities of current information access systems is a prerequisite to improving the systems' capabilities. Human-created annotations are essential to the evaluation of information systems. Examples of these annotations include identification of documents that are relevant to a searcher's need, hand-written summaries of documents and sets of documents, and answers to questions. These annotations are fundamental to comparing the performance of automatic information systems, and to understanding differences within the range of performance that people achieve at the same tasks.<br /><br />The evaluation of search systems is performed within a series of workshops known as The Text Retrieval Conference (TREC). TREC requires the building of reference material for use in evaluation. This reference material includes a set of test questions plus judgments on whether text extracts answer the questions.<br /><br />The Text Retrieval Conference Video Retrieval Evaluation (TRECVID) extends this paradigm to the evaluation of systems that use multimedia queries to research large collections of digital video.<br /><br />For the Text Analysis Conference (TAC), researchers are developing automatic summarization systems that will help a person track or follow up on a news story by giving the person summaries that focus on what is new or different as the story develops over time.<br /><br />In an effort to fulfill ITL's mission, NIST requires Contractor support to create judgments, view short video clips to determine if the clips contain the requested video material, to write summaries of Contractor selected documents, and to assess the summary content and the readability/linguistic quality of Contractor written summaries.<br /><br />The TREC, TRECVID, and TAC conferences are held yearly at NIST at the conclusion of the tasks.<br /><br /><strong>APPLICABLE ATTACHMENTS:<br /></strong><br />Attached to this solicitation are the following:<br />&bull; Attachment I - Statement of Work for resultant Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract;<br />&bull; Attachment II - Mock Task Order (MTO) Statement of Work;<br />&bull; Attachment III - Evaluation Criteria, Required Submissions, and Basis for Award;<br />&bull; Attachment IV - Standard Form (SF) 1449, which includes the solicitation's provisions and clauses.<br /><br /><strong>1352.215-73 INQUIRIES (APR 2010):</strong><br /><br />Offerors must submit all questions concerning this solicitation in writing electronically to adam.powell@nist.gov.

NAICS Code IS 541712.
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to procure prototypes for the Technical Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) phase on a full and open competitive basis. The CSD is intended to replace the Dual Wheel Sampling System (DWSS), the liquid/ground contamination sampler currently installed on the Stryker Nuclear Biological Chemical Reconnaissance Vehicle (NBCRV). The CSD will provide a near real-time, on-the-move capability to detect and identify Chemical Warfare Agents (CWAs), Non-Traditional Agents (NTAs), and Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TICs). The detection/identification function will continually interrogate the surface, provide data for processing, and apply algorithms to the data to detect and identify the contaminant which is present. A warning function will display detection/identification information locally and store the information in a format compatible for transmission to external communication systems.</p>
<p>Contract requirements are for the TMRR phase - where the contractor provides prototype hardware with Government testing, program, systems engineering and logistics support, and delivery of technical data (end-item products, software, and logistics). Initial prototypes will be Brassboard for laboratory tests. Final prototypes will be capable of integrating on the M998 High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) to test on the move capability. In future efforts, the CSD will integrate onto the Stryker NBCRV. The only application for integration on the M998 HMMWV is to test capability.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates utilizing Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) completion type contract for the TMRR phase. The government intends to make up to three (3) awards.</p>

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Columbia Cascades Area Office, Yakima Washington, has a need to overhaul a turbine and pump located at the Chandler Pumping Plant facility which is located at 47415 Old Inland Empire Hwy, Benton City, Washington 99320.  The work consists of inspection, testing, repair, and final machining of pump and turbine components.  Work includes: testing and inspection of bearings to confirm the usability and repairs if needed and approved; final machining of the wear ring on a spare turbine runner; and inspection and refurbishing the existing turbine runner including the installation of a new wear ring and the inspection and repair of the existing impeller.  The contractor shall be responsible for all labor, materials, and supplies to rebuild and test the turbine and pump, and pick-up and delivery.  Reclamation recognizes that without dismantling the pump prior to complete diagnoses, a complete statement of work is not available.  Firm fixed price tasks will be addressed in the solicitation.  Any additional work (determined necessary during the inspection) that is NOT defined in the solicitation will be addressed after award via modification.  Additional work will be negotiated with a Reclamation Contracting Officer and the contractor.  The turbine is a James Leffel and Company turbine and the pump is a Worthington Hydrocone Pump.  Known condition at time of last operation is that the turbine and pump were fully operational.  This requirement is being issued as a full and open competition.  The product services code is J043.  An electronic copy of the Request for Quotation will be posted in the near future.  Price, experience, technical, and branch location will be evaluated to determine the awardee.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 1: RFI EXTENDED; RESPONSES DUE BY 4PM EASTERN TIME ON JUNE 3, 2016.<br /><br />Request for Information (RFI): Biospecimen Processing and Storage<br /><br />Notice Number: <br />HHS-NIH-NCI-RFI-PCPSB-65002-45<br /><br />Key Dates: <br />Response Due Date: no later than 4PM Eastern Time on June 3, 2016.<br /><br />Issued By:<br />National Cancer Institute (NCI), Office of Acquisitions (OA)<br /><br />General Information:<br />This Request for Information (RFI) is intended to provide source material for a Biospecimen Core Resource (BCR) to support various cancer genomics studies. The BCR consists of three components: Biospecimen Processing Center (BPC), Clinical Data Center (CDC), and the Center for Cancer Genomics (CCG) Biorepository and Archive (CBA). A major prerequisite of the genomics studies supported by the CCG is the acquisition of high quality biospecimens. To meet this need, NCI maintains relations with clinical sites and projects providing high quality, clinically annotated biospecimens to a centralized quality control and processing facility.<br /><br />This RFI should not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Federal Government, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.<br /><br />Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.<br /><br />This RFI is issued for the purpose of providing source material to assist in formulating a procurement strategy for a prospective solicitation from the National Cancer Institute.<br /><br />Purpose:<br />The responses to this RFI may guide the NCI in awarding future contracts at an undetermined time. There is no solicitation available at this time; no basis for claims against NCI shall arise as a result of this RFI, responses thereto or the NCI's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.<br /><br />This notice is for market research only to make decisions regarding the contract type best suited to provide biospecimen processing and storage for the NCI CCG. The NCI is specifically interested in determining whether a fixed price type contract utilizing fixed unit prices for services is possible for the tasks outlined below.<br /><br />NAICS Code and Size Standard:<br />In the event a Request for Proposal (RFP) is issued, Task Area A is assigned North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541380 - Testing Laboratories which has a size standard of $15,000,000. Task Area B is assigned NAICS code 493120 - Refrigerated Warehouse and Storage which has a size standard of $27,500,000 are being considered. The majority of the work is estimated to be under NAICS 541380.<br /><br />Background: <br />The Center for Cancer Genomics (CCG) conducts genomics studies on biospecimens from patients in clinical trials and from other source sites using many of the components in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) infrastructure. These components include one or more Tissue Source Site (TSS), Biospecimen Processing Center (BPC), Clinical Data Center (CDC), CCG Biorepository and Archive (CBA), Genome Characterization Center (GCC), Genomic Data Analysis Center (GDAC), and Genomic Data Commons (GDC). The CCG Biospecimen Processing Center (BPC) will support an expanding list of genomics studies.<br /><br />CCG Biospecimen Core Resource<br />A major prerequisite of the genomics studies supported by CCG is the acquisition of high quality biospecimens. To meet this need, NCI maintains relations with clinical sites and projects providing high quality, clinically annotated biospecimens to a centralized quality control and processing facility. The term "high quality" refers to the histological and molecular properties of the tissue, the existence of appropriate informed consent provisions for the intended use of the biomolecules and data, collection and subsequent distribution under an Institutional Review Board (IRB) reviewed protocol, as well as unencumbered access for research use (e.g., intellectual property restrictions). For these genomics studies, the BPC contractor will be the primary biospecimen interface between CCG and the sites that provide samples. <br /><br />The CCG BCR will serve as the centralized tissue processing center for genomics studies. In addition, the BCR will provide analytes for one or more designated characterization center(s) and collect and standardize clinical annotations. Standard Operating Protocols (SOP) will govern sample collection, pathological examination, analytes (e.g., DNA and RNA) extractions, quality control, laboratory data collection, and analyte distribution to designated characterization center(s). The BCR will ensure that samples and sample data are received and managed under Material Transfer Agreements that represent the policies of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for each genomics study.<br /><br />Anticipated tasks include:<br /><br />TASK AREA A - Biospecimen Processing Center (BPC) Services<br />1) Biospecimen and Associated Data Procurement<br />2) Biospecimen Management and Biorepository Operations<br />3) Biospecimen Quality Control<br />4) Biospecimen Processing into Molecular Analytes<br />5) Biospecimen and Analyte Distribution<br />6) Data Export<br />7) Other BPC-related Services<br />8) Pilot Studies<br />9) Transition Activities<br /><br />TASK AREA B - Biospecimen Processing Center<br />1) Biospecimen and Associated Data Receipt and Storage<br />2) Biospecimen Management and Biorepository Operations<br />3) Biospecimen and Analyte Distribution<br /><br />Information Requested: <br /><br />I. General Information - contact information, including name, institution / organization, telephone numbers, e-mail address, and website URL.<br /><br />II. Cost and Pricing capabilities <br /><br />The NCI seeks to understand whether it is feasible and practical to assign fixed prices to the aforementioned Task Areas. The fixed unit prices should include all labor, materials, ODCs, indirect costs and fee to perform the activities in each Task Area including the submission of deliverables. It is envisioned that there would be multiple fixed unit process depending on the activity. It is not necessary for one vendor to meet all of the capabilities described in the Statement of Work (SOW); however, vendors should be in the business of providing services for either Task Area A or B. Please review the attachments for specific activities in each Task Area and additional instructions.<br /><br />- Based on the provided SOWs and Additional Instructions, can a fixed price or fixed unit price structure be established for the required activities under each Task Area?<br />- If fixed prices are not feasible, what cost/pricing structure or combination of cost/pricing structures is feasible for the types of activities required? <br /><br />III. Vendors are encouraged to comment on any aspect of the TO SOW that they think will provide clarity to the requirement whether technical or business related.<br /><br />IV. Would your organization be able to provide the capabilities in Task Area A or B or both?<br /><br /><br />The following information pertaining to this requirement is attached to aid in determining your response to the above questions:<br />- Task Order SOW<br />- Business Proposal Instructions<br />- List of Deliverables<br /><br />How to Submit a Response:<br />Interested organizations should submit a response to this Request for Information, not to exceed 10 single sided pages including all attachments, charts, etc. (single space, 12 point font minimum) that clearly responds to the above questions.

<DESC>The 496th Air Base Squadron at Mor&oacute;n Air Base, Spain has a requirement for an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multi-discipline Architect-Engineer (A-E) Services contract.
<p>The intent is to award three (3) IDIQ contracts, but the Government reserves the right to award less than three (3) or more than three (3). The duration of the contract will be one (1) base year with four (4) one-year options which may be exercised at the discretion of the Government. The Government will award A-E design projects by issuing Firm-Fixed- Price (FFP) individual task orders (TO) to the contractor as requirements are identified by the 496th ABS/CE office during the contract period. The minimum Task Order amount is $500.00 and the maximum Task Order amount is $350,000.00.</p>
<p>No contract for construction of any project shall be awarded to the firm, subsidiaries, or affiliates that designed the project. Prior to contract award, the selected firm must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) at www.sam.gov. Failure to register may render the firm ineligible for award. If already registered, ensure representations and certifications in SAM are current.</p>
<p>In an effort to eliminate conflict of interest issues, the Government may award an IDIQ contract to a prime contractor and their first level subcontractor and/or team members, but not to both. For example, a prime contractor, first level subcontractor and/or team members who were selected for one A/E contract will not be considered for another A/E contract. The separation of contracts is intended to mitigate conflict of interest issues with competing A/E firms.</p>
<p>Due to the overseas location of this solicitation, no Small Business set-aside will be used. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes for this acquisition are 541330, 541310, and 541690.</p>

F.	The exterior of the machinery and any other parts of the equipment subject to rust shall be properly painted. Any surfaces, particularly floors, steps and handrails that have a dull or worn appearance after cleaning shall be painted so that cleaning efforts are evident.

G. CO/COR shall periodically inspect equipment and equipment spaces for cleanliness.  The inspection shall consist of a visual observation to detect any accumulation of dust on any surface required to be kept clean under this Contract.

H.	Debris, rubbish, and recyclable material resulting from work under this Contract may be disposed of on VAMC property at the direction of the CO/COR or off site at the option of the Contractor. The Contractor must dispose of all hazardous waste in accordance with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and its associated state and local regulations. 

PART V - QUALITY CONTROL

5.1 QUALITY CONTROL PROGRAM

	A. Contractor shall establish a complete Quality Control Program to assure the requirements of the Contract are provided as specified. The Contractor shall submit this program to the CO/COR, for acceptance within ten (10) days of Notice to Proceed. QCP shall be in compliance with the Maintenance Control Program as required by ASME A17.1 Section 8.6. The program shall include the following:

		1. An inspection system covering all the services described in the Contract. A checklist used for inspecting Contract performance during scheduled or unscheduled inspections and the name(s) of the individual(s) who will perform the inspection.

		2. The checklist shall include every area of the Contractor's operation as well as every task required to be performed.

		3. A system for identifying and correcting deficiencies before the level of performance becomes unacceptable and/or the Medical Center inspectors point out the deficiencies.
		4. A file of all inspections conducted by the Contractor and the corrective action taken.  This documentation shall be made available to the VAMC upon request, at any time during the term of the Contract.

PART VI - PAYMENT

6.1 PAYMENT FOR VERIFIABLE WORK COVERED UNDER THE CONTRACT

	A. Payment for all of the work covered under this Contract shall be made on a lump-sum basis for a one-year period billed on a monthly basis.  Payment will include compensation for all labor, materials, parts, tools, equipment, transportation, supervision, administration, insurance, third-party testers, certifications, licenses, travel and all costs incurred directly or indirectly by the Contractor in an effort to complete the work of this Contact.

B. Payment will be made in arrears of the specified billing period after receipt of a properly prepared invoice, provided all required work, including preventive maintenance, submission of reports and all other requirements for the period in questions have been performed in accordance with contract stipulations, and can be verified with service reports signed by VA Engineering COTR or designee.

C. Contractors failure to schedule and perform a PM within the specified time interval shall be considered non-compliance with terms of contract, and VA will deduct proportionately from payments for services missed. Criticality of this equipment requires that continued such failure will necessitate holding Contractor in default and the VA obtaining suitable service via separate means.

6.2 PAYMENT FOR WORK NOT COVERED UNDER THE CONTRACT

	A. Unless otherwise directed by the CO or unless acting in a good faith effort to perform emergency work (i.e., life, safety, entrapment, etc.), the Contractor shall not perform any work outside of the Scope of this Contract without authorization from the Contracting Officer and the issuance of a separate Purchase Order.  Failure to receive prior approval for out-of-scope work will most likely result in the denial of compensation.

Justification and Approval (J&A)
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition (>$150K)


Acquisition Plan Action ID: 659-16-2-6843-0006

1.	Contracting Activity:  The Department of Veterans Affairs VISN 6 Network Contracting Office plans to contract by means other than full and open competition in response to procurement request for Radio System Upgrade and Expansion in support of the Salisbury Veterans Affairs Medical Center.

2. 		Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed: This requirement is to expand current Medical Center communications capabilities for VAMC Salisbury and adds HCC Charlotte and Kernersville, NC.   An upgrade to multi-site capabilities is required to the existing system in order to accomplish this expansion.  This expansion is required to comply with the initial Hazard Analysis finding conducted during HCC Pre-activation planning phase. This expansion project will provide back-up communications capabilities at each facility as well as provide communications between the HCC's, and the HCC's and VAMC Salisbury existing digital voice systems. Project will ensure direct communications on a daily basis at each location and will enhance Incident Command and Control functions during activation. Project will also provide redundant communications capabilities in the event of a single system failure. Project will provide direct, instant, and secure communication capabilities with leadership during emergency situations that require activation of Hospital Incident Command functions. The VISN 6 Network Contracting Office intends on awarding a sole source firm fixed price contract to Two-Way Radio of Carolina Inc. 

3. 	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  Equipment required to upgrade the existing system to multi-site includes a multi-site controller, networking equipment, multiservice router and digital repeater.   VHF hand held radios shall integrate with current TDMA digital voice and data communication system that is housed at Salisbury VA Medical Center. The system shall provide reliable, efficient, radio functionality within the Salisbury VA Health Care System (SVAHCS) and shall connect the VA Medical Center Facilities together using IP Connectivity interference free VHF frequencies. Each radio shall be able to turn to each operational channel of another facility and maintain communications during normal operations or an emergency event. The radio system shall seamlessly connect all of the VAMC Facilities together utilizing IP connectivity. Select supervisors shall have the ability to maintain priority levels on their communications to ensure Command and Control during emergency events and will also have the ability to initiate an "All Call" to broadcast emergency traffic. 
The total estimated cost of this procurement is $ 185,435.00  

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:   

	( X )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	(  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
		       or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
	(  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
	(  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

 
5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):    

a.	Only One Responsible Source (FAR 6.302-1)  

In 2013, VAMC executed a competitive bid process and chose a Motorola solution to fulfill their Emergency and Operational communications requirements.  This current requirement is an upgrade to the existing equipment and supports the system chosen in the competitive bid process of 2013 in all aspects of form, fit and function.  Part 22, FB8 Frequencies have a 70 mile interference free contour making them ultimately interference free.  All frequencies are controlled and licensed by the FCC and the FCC issued the rights to use them to Two-Way Radio of Carolina for a period of ten years with all rights of renewal in specific geographic areas. The two areas specified in this requirement are Area 18 for Kernersville and Area 23 for Salisbury and Charlotte.  Two-Way Radio of Carolina is the licensee of the required frequencies for those areas.  These rights were recently renewed for another ten years.  These Part 22, FB8 licenses and rules of use and protection are public record, and they cannot be used by anyone without permission of the licensee, and are protected by the FCC enforcement division for these types infringements.  Two-Way Radio of Carolina holds the license needed to provide the local Exclusive Private FB8 guaranteed Interference free VHF frequency service required to ensure the VAMC communications will maintain interference free communications during normal operations and emergency critical events.    

The Carolina Connect Wide Area System is required to provide coverage for personnel that are travelling between sites or off campus.  Motorola Connect Plus is the system that the VA chose in 2013 and the method that the system uses to process the signals is the proprietary ownership of Motorola.  The FB8 frequencies are a "must" for the Motorola trunking system when using a public safety level control channel.
 
This upgrade to the existing investment uses proprietary signaling and trunking format which limits the source to one manufacturer.    The Multi-Site expansion of the system requires clean, Hi-Powered VHF Exclusive Spectrum which is currently only available through Two-Way Radio of Carolina.
  
b.  Unusual and Compelling Urgency (FAR 6.302-2, 6.303-2(a)(9)(ii))  
c. 	Industrial Mobilization; or Engineering, Developmental, or Research Capability (FAR 6.302-3) 
d. 	Authorized or Required by Statute (FAR 6.302-5)  
e. 	National Security (FAR 6.302-6) 
f. 	Public Interest (FAR 6.302-7)  

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  Additional sources were not sought.   As this requirement is an upgrade and expansion to the existing system purchased in 2013 and installed and maintained by Two-Way Radio of Carolina, the knowledge and expertise held by the original vendor is paramount in avoiding any undue duplication costs or delays.  Because this is an upgrade and expansion of an existing system and because of the proprietary nature of the trunking system, purchase of any other system would require the replacement of the existing usable system.  Two-Way Radio holds the license for the frequencies needed to guaranteed Interference free VHF frequency service required to ensure the VAMC communications will maintain interference free communications.
  
7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:   Contracting Officer has determined cost to be fair and reasonable based on the knowledge of the Contracting Officer Representative for this project as well, historical pricing data from the 2013 purchase of original system and comparison to similar projects.

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  Market Research findings included the 2013 contract that was awarded competitively - VA246-13-P-2337.  Previous solicitation was for Motorola Brand Name Only, small business set-aside requiring offerors to be a Certified Motorola Premier Service Partner. SAM, small business and Experian were used to verify the status of Two-Way Radio of Carolina with acceptable results.  The Federal Communications Commission website was accessed to verify the ownership of the frequencies.  
 
9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  Motorola equipment is specified for compatibility with the existing Motorola system.   Motorola radios specified will decrease training expense on new equipment and allow immediate interchangeable equipment in case of a radio failure.  Emergency services radio communications require intricate knowledge of various jurisdictional (local/state/regional) requirements and expertise in addition to the technical aspects of installing, maintaining and programming/configuring the system.  Motorola/Two-Way Radio of Carolinas were the original installers and the most qualified to complete this upgrade and expansion.  

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  N/A

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  
As the primary equipment in the system becomes obsolete and requires replacement, competitive sourcing market research to determine other interested sources or suppliers of similar products in an open source environment will be conducted. If other sources or suppliers of similar open source products can be identified in the future without a substantial duplication of cost or gap in service, the Government can procure the equipment and services without proprietary source code. Future market forces will likely ensure a more competitive environment as the current equipment will eventually require technical refresh/upgrade beyond that provided in this particular acquisition.

Acquisition Plan Action ID: VA244-16-AP-6183

This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program. The material or service listed in par. 3 below is sole source, therefore, consideration of the number of contractors required by FAR Subpart 8.4 - Federal Supply Schedules, is precluded for the reasons indicated below.  

Restricted to the following source:  Provide original manufacturer's name for material or contractor's name for service.  (If a sole source manufacturer distributes via dealers, ALSO provide dealer information.)

Manufacturer/Contractor: Beckman Coulter	
Manufacturer/Contractor POC & phone number:  Jim Hitt	
Mfgr/Contractor Address: jim.hitt@beckman.com; 239-898-2723	
Dealer/Rep address/phone number: OI Box 8000, 205 S. Kraemer Blvd, Brea, CA 92822	

1  The requested material or service represents the minimum requirements of the Government.

(1)  AGENCY AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITY:	Department of Veterans Affairs	
	Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Services 
		
	     	
                                                                          VISN:	4	

(2)  NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF ACTION BEING APPROVED:
This is for a new interim BPA with Beckman Coulter for Chemistry, Immunoassay, and Hematology laboratory testing services.  The current BPA (VA244-15-A-0064) expires on May 31, 2016 and the new, competitive BPA will not be in place by that time. This justification will provide for an interim BPA for the period of June 1, 2016 - July 31, 2016.

This procurement is for Chemistry, Immunoassay, and Hematology Laboratory testing services for VISN 4 Medical Centers and is justified in accordance with FAR 8.405-5(c).

(3)	(a)	A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEED:
The required service is Chemistry, Immunoassay, and Hematology laboratory testing services for the VISN 4 VA Medical Centers. The period of performance will be June 1, 2016 - July 31, 2016. The BPA will cover the services needed until a new, competitive action is awarded.  The total estimated value of this acquisition is $ 545,300.90, which is based on historical pricing.

	(b)	ESTIMATED DOLLAR VALUE:  $545,300.90	

	(c)	REQUIRED DELIVERY  DATE:   June 1, 2016 - July 31, 2016	

(4)	IDENTIFICATION OF THE JUSTIFICATION RATIONALE (SEE FAR 8.405-6), AND IF APPLICABLE, A DEMONSTRATION OF THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED SUPPLY OR SERVICE.  (CHECK ALL THAT APPLY AND COMPLETE)

1	Specific characteristics of the material or service that limit the availability to a sole source (unique features, function of the item, etc.).  Describe in detail why only this suggested source can furnish the requirements to the exclusion of other sources.

The services are currently covered under BPA, VA244-16-A-0081, which expires on May 31, 2016. A new contract is being competitively solicited and awarded but that contract will not be in place by this time.  Without this interim BPA, the VA would experience unacceptable delays for patient testing services. 

The VA is currently using Beckman Coulter's equipment (analyzer and reagents) to perform the testing services.  After May 31, 2016 Beckman Coulter has no contractual obligation to keep their equipment in the VA Medical Centers.  Without the equipment, VA cannot perform the required testing and patient services would be inadvertently impacted.  

Beckman Coulter is approved by the FDA for their supplies and equipment. The company also has the equipment in place at the medical centers so that VA Lab technicians can continue to perform testing. Another company would not be able to put their equipment in each medical center and ensure its operational by June 1, 2016.  Accordingly, Beckman Coulter is the only firm capable of providing the analyzer reagents without the Veteran's Health Administration experiencing unacceptable delays in fulfilling its requirements.

0	A patent, copyright or proprietary data limits competition.  The proprietary data is:  
     (If FAR 8.405-6(a)(2)iii before posting.  Do not include specific proprietary data. Only mention the type of equipment, procedure, etc. to show that proprietary supplies or services are being procured.)	
     	
     	
     	
     	

0	These are "direct replacements" parts/components for existing equipment.  
____________________________________________________________________________
____________________________________________________________________________

0	The material/service must be compatible in all aspects (form, fit and function) with existing systems presently installed/performing.  Describe the equipment/function you have now and how the new item/service must coordinate, connect, or interface with the existing system.
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	

0	The new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order must not have been previously issued under sole source or limited source procedures. 

     	
     	
     	
     	


0	An urgent and compelling need exists, and following the ordering procedures would result in unacceptable delays. 
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	

(5)  DESCRIBE WHY YOU BELIEVE THE ORDER REPRESENTS THE BEST VALUE CONSISTENT WITH FAR 8.4 TO AID THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IN MAKING THIS BEST VALUE DETERMINATION:  
This contract's pricing was based off of Federal Supply Schedule purchase prices over the past five years.  It is estimated that the cost of this interim BPA will be  $545,300.90.  FAR 8.404(d) states that GSA pricing is determined to be fair and reasonable at the time of GSA contract award.  Further, this pricing is consistent with the prior, competitive BPA's pricing (VA244-BP-0077 which expired on 09/30/2015) which was also determined to be fair and reasonable at the time of BPA award.  Therefore, the BPA prices are fair and reasonable.  

(6)  DESCRIBE THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AMONG SCHEDULE HOLDERS AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
A new contract is currently being solicited for competitive award.  Due to CRB approvals and revised requirements, this new contract will not be in place by June 1, 2016.

(7)  ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE JUSTIFICATION:
N/A.

(8)  A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS THAT LED TO THE RESTRICTED CONSIDERATION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES IS MADE:
A new BPA is being prepared for competitive solicitation and award.

(9)  REQUIREMENTS CERTIFICATION:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.  I understand that processing of this limited sources justification restricts consideration of Federal Supply Schedule contractors to fewer than the number required by FAR Subpart 8.4.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development in Kosovo (USAID/Kosovo) intends to make a sole source award to Chemonics International, Inc. for a cost extension to an existing task order (AID-167-TO-14-00002) under the Public Financial Management IDIQ contract (AID-OAA-I-12-00035).  Launching a competition at this stage of the activity would result in a duplication of costs and efforts, and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.  The Partnerships for Development (PfD) activity is the flagship USAID economic policy, legal reform and governance improvement program in Kosovo.  This extension for continued services under the present task order will supplement the program with resources needed to further the progress achieved to date and allow USAID to conclude a number of on-going, long-standing initiatives as well as continue to respond to Government of Kosovo's urgent needs.<br />The statutory authority permitting the award without providing full and open competition is AIDAR 706.302-70(a)(2), which says that "full and open competition need not be obtained when it would impair or otherwise have an adverse effect on programs conducted for the purpose of foreign aid, relief and rehabilitation."  It further states in 706.302-70(b)(5) that this authority may be used for an award for the continued provision of highly specialized services when award to another resource would result in substantial additional costs to the Government or would result in unacceptable delays.<br />No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.
