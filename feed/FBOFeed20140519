<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to support the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention (NCHHSTP). This will be a new requirement. It is anticipated that the resultant contract will be a cost-plus-fixed-fee type with a period of performance of 72 months (Base Period of 24 months, with two (2) Option Periods for 24 months each). The applicable NAICS code is 541712 with a size standard of 500 employees. The RFP will be posted on FedBizOpps and is expected to be released on or about June 10, 2014. Interested parties are responsible for checking the website regularly for release of the RFP and for other procurement-related documents. TELEPHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. The information provided in this pre-solicitation is for information purposes only. If there are any differences in the information provided here and the actual solicitation when released, the information provided in the actual solicitation shall govern.<br /><br />The CDC/NCHHSTP has a potential requirement to better understand the performance of available HIV tests using fresh whole blood and oral fluid specimens. CDC is particularly interested in sensitivity early in infection, when the antibody response is developing.<br />&nbsp;
<p>An estimated 50,000 new HIV infections occur each year in the United States. Men who have sex with men (MSM) are estimated to have the highest incidence of new HIV infections. The first few weeks after HIV infection, referred to as the acute stage in this document, can be defined as the stage when HIV infection can be detected by testing for HIV virus directly, but there is no detectable HIV-specific antibody response. Although clinical sensitivity of tests for HIV antibodies appears to be improving, detection of HIV infection during the acute stage, by definition, requires the ability to detect virus directly rather than relying on detection of antibody. Molecular tests for HIV have traditionally been complicated and expensive to perform, and although a variety of strategies to utilize these tests in clinical settings have been proposed, they are still not widely used. Several new HIV tests have recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use on unprocessed specimens (e.g. fingerstick whole blood and/or oral fluid) at the point-of-care (POC), or their approval is imminent. So that CDC can monitor and update HIV testing guidance that reflects newly available testing technology and characterizes the relative performance of available tests, an evaluation must be conducted to understand the differences in sensitivity of the newest HIV serologic tests using unprocessed specimens collected from infected individuals while they are in the acute stage of disease. In addition, there is a need to evaluate the diagnostic performance of nucleic acid (molecular) tests to allow CDC to determine the applicability of this technology for use in a variety of clinical and point-of-care settings. In order to maximize the yield of persons identified shortly after they have been infected while limiting overall project costs, the study will be conducted in three parts.</p>
<p>The objectives of each part of the proposed project are:</p>
<p>1) To identify persons at high-risk for early infection. In Part 1, up to 50,000 persons presenting for an HIV test at study sites will be categorized as high or lower risk, based on information extracted from their medical records, or collected directly from participants through a short questionnaire. This behavioral screener which will be used on 50,000 participants seeking HIV testing will be used to identify no more than 10,000 highest risk clinic clients for selection for Part 2. <br />2) The objective of Part 2 is to evaluate the tests under study using fresh specimens collected from no more than 10,000 Part 2 participants, including a minimum of 600 HIV-infected participants and 50 participants with early infection. Part 2 of the study will involve collecting specimens for testing with the HIV testing technologies being evaluated.<br />3) The objective of Part 3 is to evaluate the seroconversion sensitivity of the new HIV tests through serial follow-up. Participants with discordant test results will undergo frequent follow-up testing to document either seroconversion on all tests being evaluated, two consecutive visits with negative test results on all tests (indicating reactive Part 2 tests were false-positive), or the completion of 70 days of follow-up. It is expected that at least 50 participants with early infection will complete Part 3 follow-up.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that more than one contract may be awarded from the resultant solicitation.</p>
<p>The offeror shall furnish all the necessary personnel, facilities, supplies, equipment, as appropriate, to provide CDC with the required scientific, technical, and operational services, within the general work parameters set forth in the statement of work.</p>

Synopsis: THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source purchase order under Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 13.106-1(b).
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Acquisition Resource Management (OARM), 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington, DC 20460 requires maintenance service for two Government-owned spectrometers.

This requirement is to provide maintenance on two government owned Isoprime Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometers. Elementar Americas Inc. is the only company that is authorized to provide factory trained technicians and original manufactured parts for Isoprime Isootope Ratio Mass Spectrometers at EPA?s facility at Atlantic Ecology Division, 27 Tarzwell Drive, Narragansett, RI.

<DESC>The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b), with Fondriest Environmental, Inc. to purchase five (5) YSI 6600-M multi-parameter sonde with bulkhead connector, medium depth, conductivity, turbidity, temperature and Rhodamine sensors.
Fondriest Environmental, Inc. is an authorized distributor for YSI.  The nature of the acquisition requires a vendor that possesses the unique capabilities of supplying a broad range of components and subsystems to complete our present gaps in existing YSI inventory so as to assemble complete monitoring systems for green infrastructure research in various US locations. The components and subsystems must be compatible with our existing YSI inventory, which we have built up over the years, and because our USGS (in both OH and NE) partners use YSI gear. These units must be compatible to communicate with each other. We have had issues in the past with different brands that are unable to ?talk to each other?, and compatibility issues with sensors when calibrations and specifications are different.  EPA currently has five YSI 6600 sondes in inventory and requires five additional matching units with the capabilities to measure turbidity, pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), oxida tion reduction potential (ORP) and conductivity, with the addition of a Rhodamine sensor, so that we have full coverage for watershed and GI projects. Rhodamine is a trace dye placed in a designated stream, drain or other streamflow, and then the concentration is measured at a downstream location with a Rhodamine sensor. This will provide accurate measures of discharge and show proper mixing in water. Based on the above, the exact units are needed to fulfill the government?s requirements. 
YSI does not directly sell their equipment, but uses regional vendors, with only one vendor in each region.  Sondes take a lot of abuse in the field.  Ready access to technicians and parts is essential to maintain contiguous monitoring for the different sampling periods, which will include storms. EPA has identified Fondriest Environmental, Inc. as the only contractor in the region able to meet the requirements of this procurement.  Fondriest Environmental, Inc., is the only authorized distributor in Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Kentucky, West Virginia and Western Pennsylvania to sell, service and upgrade this equipment.  
This procurement will be accomplished under FAR Part 12 Commercial Procedures.  Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETATIVE QUOTATIONS.  A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Sources wishing to be considered by the agency MUST submit documentation to the office identified in this notice.  Documentation must be submitted within 15 calendar days of the date of publication of this notice.  Submit your request in writing to Renita Tyus at the address shown above or email at tyus.renita@epa.gov.   Telephone requests will not be honored.

<a href="mailto:Marsha.R.Sells@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Sacramento</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is authorized by Congress to maintain both the Sacramento and Stockton Deep Water Ship Channels (DWSC) to their authorized depths.  The maintenance dredging for these channels is conducted on an annual basis.  The Sacramento DWSC is contained within the confines of the Sacramento River and the man-made portion of the ship channel.  The Stockton DWSC follows the San Joaquin River.  Due to natural sedimentation, shoals develop which compromise the authorized depths of both ship channels.  These shoals cause draft restrictions which increase the cost and safety for the shipping industry.  Historically, approximately 200,000 to 400,000 cubic yards of shoaled material has been dredged annually.  Due to endangered species, the fisheries window for maintenance dredging is Aug 1 through Nov 30.  After the winter storm run-off, the USACE conducts bathymetric surveys used to determine where shoaling has developed.  The USACE also develops the Notice of Intent (NOI) which is presented to the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board (CVRWQCB).  The NOI is used by the CVRWQCB to issue the Clean Water Act Section 401 Water Quality Certification in the form a Notice of Applicability (NOA).       <br> This solicitation will be for a 3 year Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) Single Award Type (SATOC) contract with a maximum capacity of $10M per year for a total contract capacity of $30M.  The estimated dredge quantities for the Task Orders will be developed from the NOA and bathymetric surveys.  The pricing for Task Orders will be based on the individual pricing schedule set for each year of the contract.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> Acquisition Information: <br>  <br> This acquisition is proceeding as a Request for Proposals (RFP) using the Trade-off Method.  This RFP is a Competitive, Unrestricted Full and Open Competition and all businesses may respond.   <br>  <br> Estimated Cost Range is between $25,000,000 - $100,000,000 <br>  <br> Period of Performance for Construction:  121 Days each dredging season. <br>  <br> This Procurement will be conducted under FSC CODE: Z1KF, SIC CODE: 1629, NAICS Code: 237990.  The size standard for this code is $33,500,000.  All questions should be directed to the Contract Specialist, Marsha Sells, at (916) 557-5232, FAX: No.: (916) 557-5278, e-mail marsha.r.sells@usace.army.mil.   <br>  <br> Information about the time and location of the site visit/pre-proposal conference will be found in Section 00 21 00 of the solicitation. If you need assistance with downloading the plans or specs or registering as an Interested Vendor, please contact the Contract Specialist. <br>  <br>  <br> It is anticipated that the RFP will be issued on or about June 2, 2014, for downloading at the Government's website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.

<DESC>Pre-Solicitation Notice - VA261-14-R-0538

This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice that the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Palo Alto Health Care System (VAPAHCS) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) as a 100% Set-Aside to Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB) to perform four (4) major tasks as identified in the Synopsis below.

Interested Vendors are not required to notify the Contracting Officer of their intent. Vendors are to look for the posting of the RFP on/about May 27, 2014 in the FBO Website under VA261-14-R-0538.

Synopsis of Requirement: 

The Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System (VAPAHCS) at 4951 Arroyo Road, Livermore, California 94550, Building 62, has a dental clinic which operates four chairs, six days a week. The current dental vacuum system identified as Gardner Denver was installed in 1973 utilizing a non-positive-displacement pump multi-stage centrifugal system. The current vacuum system has a 480 volt, 3-phase motor manually controlled from the dental clinic via a push button control. The main vacuum lines are 2-inch copper tubes running from the basement room number 9 to room number 247, 248 and 251 on the second floor. 

Description of the Required Work: The branch lines have recently been upgraded from  inch tube to 1  inch tube. The jet flow, 14 gallon separation tank, is damaged and is held together with "duct tape plumbed with ABS" and without an amalgam separator. The ABS exhaust tubing from the vacuum producer is not within VA specifications and has the potential to fail or harm maintenance staff.  The VA dental clinic has complained that the vacuum system does not provide adequate suction during dental clinic procedures. The current suction is between 2.5-3 SCFM (standard cubic feet per minute) which does not satisfy the VA specification of a minimum suction of 7 SCFM at each high volume oral evacuation (HVE).

Four Major Tasks  

1. The Contractor shall procure and install VPD10D2- ECO Dry-VAC System or brand name or equal and SolmeteX HG5 Amalgam separator per manufacturer's installation instructions and VA Specifications.  

2. The Contractor shall remove and replace with existing dental vacuum system, ABS plumbing and components without interruption of service. 
 
3. The Contractor shall purchase the necessary materials and components to replace the ABS plumbing with copper tubing and install the trap seal primer. 

4. The Contractor shall modify and relocate the existing sump pit guardrail and access ladder. The Contractor shall paint the guardrail to match existing colors.

The proposed NAICS code is 561990 and small business size is $10.0 million.  

The VA intends to award a Firm-Fixed Price contract. Period of Performance will begin immediately after award of contract. 
 
The solicitation document will be posted on/about May 27, 2014. Potential offerors are to obtain all the required documents and attachments from the FBO website. 

Questions should be emailed directly to Leala.Jew@va.gov Include in the email, the POC Name and address of company, phone numbers, DUNS number, and email address. 

 DISCLAIMER
 
This Notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation. All information received in response to this notice that is marked as proprietary will be handled accordingly. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this Notice.

Part: U.S. Government Procurements<br /><br />2. Subpart: Engineering Services<br /><br />3. Procurement Classification Code: R-Professional, Administrative, and Management Support Services.<br /><br />4. Agency: Department of the Air Force<br /><br />5. Responsible Office and Address: Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center (AFNWC), Contracting Division (PZID) 8500 Gibson Blvd SE, Bldg. 20202 Kirtland AFB, NM 87117.<br /><br />6. Notice Type: Sources Sought - Statement of Capabilites<br /><br />7. Description of the efforts needed are included in the attached draft Performance Work Statement (PWS): The Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center contracting office (PZID) is contracting for Engineering tasks required to support the AFNWC/EN to define and execute a Hardness Testing and Validation (HT&amp;V) process that gathers data to certify electromagnetic pulse (EMP) survivability for AF nuclear capable air systems. This will require an understanding of the roles and responsibilities of the appropriate DOD and DOE organizations to determine points of contact to conduct an in depth evaluation and derive the HT&amp;V process solution. The goal of this effort is to generate a Nuclear Weapon Effect (NWE) EMP HT&amp;V aircraft system survivability process. The offeror must understand the goal, content, purpose and direction to build a process that certifies AF nuclear capable air systems, including aircraft on-board nuclear command and control (NC2) equipment, will not fail due to NWE generated EMP.
<p>The contractor shall accompany the Government to acquire information, including, but not limited to, surveying the activities, procedures, goals and limitations of the organizations listed in PWS Para 2.1.1. Gathered information will be used to ensure that Military Standard (MIL STD) 3023/2169C certification requirements are met. Access to classified DTRA database and classified information will be required at the Secret Level. All work must be integrated with government civilians within AFNWC/EN and will only be done in AFNWC facilities at Kirtland AFB NM, except during temporary duty support.</p>
<p>The offeror is responsible for training employees in current publication software on offeror time. The offeror will submit a documented quality control plan, number of experienced employees, currency of employee experience, and capability plan to replace employees who resign or are removed for cause. The offeror will support TDYs for conferences or other support activities in CONUS per government direction. All personnel must have and be able to maintain a minimum of a Top Secret Security Clearance.</p>
<p>8. Foreign owned firms are advised they are precluded from submitting a SOC. These firms are advised to contact the Contracting Point of Contact or Technical Point of Contact with any questions. These positions require employees to be United States Citizens with the capability to obtain and maintain a minimum Top Secret clearance.</p>
<p>Restriction on performance by foreign citizens (i.e., those holding non-U.S. Passports): This topic is "Export-controlled". The information and materials provided pursuant to or resulting from this topic are restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), 22 C.F.R. Parts 120 - 130 or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 C.F.R. Parts 730 - 774, which control the export of sensitive technical data. Foreign Citizens may perform work under an unclassified award resulting from this topic only if they are designated as a US Person, as defined by 22 CFR &sect; 120.15 or if bidder is able to obtain an export license through the Department of State or Department of Commerce. Foreign Citizens designated as US Persons are not permitted to perform work under a classified award. Foreign citizens will at no time be allowed to work on Air Force installations.</p>
<p>9. Technology developed under the subject program may be subject to U.S. export-control laws and regulations. These laws restrict the transfer, by any means, of certain types of items, information and technology to unauthorized persons. The award of a government contract does not negate the contractor's responsibility to comply with export control requirements under the Arms Export Control Act (Department of State) or the Export Administration Regulations (Department of Commerce). Potential security risks/export violations may occur when contractors employ foreign nationals or outsource portions of the contract's statement of work. The transfer of sensitive or critical unclassified technology to a foreign national without an approved export license is a violation of the Arms Export Control Act and the Export Administration Act.</p>
<p>10. Request for Statement of Capability (SOC):</p>
<p>The Statement of Capability (SOC) shall contain the following information: (1) Demonstrate ability to respond to all mission areas; (2) Include a notional plan to assure the availability of an adequate number of qualified and trained personnel to perform the continuous mission requirements; (3) Demonstrate how classified work at the Top Secret level would be accomplished to define and execute a Hardness Testing and Validation (HT&amp;V) process that gathers data to certify EMP survivability for AF nuclear capable air systems.</p>
<p>All interested firms shall submit a response that includes detailed information demonstrating their capabilities to the Contracting Specialist listed below. Email one (1) copy to the Contracting Specialist no later than 5:00 pm MST on 26 Feb, 2014.

All contractors' employees shall maintain, at a minimum, a Secret level clearance Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI), CNWDI, and NATO. Also, access to classified AF and DTRA databases will be required at the Top Secret Level.</p>

Firms should include if they are a GSA Schedule holder and what Schedule and Special Item Number(s) (SINs) they would propose potential work under. NAICS Code to be used for this acquisition is 541712, Size Standard $7M.</p>
<p>12. Any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought synopsis is strictly voluntary. As stipulated in FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely within the Government's discretion. This Sources Sought Notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. Respondents will not individually be notified of the results of any government assessments. The Government's evaluation of the capability statements received will factor into whether any forthcoming solicitation will be conducted as a full and open competition or as a set-aside for small businesses, or any particular small business designation (e.g., SDVOSB, HUBZone, 8(a), SDB, WOSB, VOSB, etc.).

We require accurate temperature readings of the filament/sample up to 3000&deg;C along with a temperature and optical display on the end of the pyrometer. In addition to these technical requirements there are several size constraints. The pyrometer will be mounted onto the optical view port of the mass spectrometer. This view port is 3 inches in diameter . The view port is on the side of the chamber, meaning the pyrometer must be light in weight in order to be mounted correctly and prevent slipping. The pyrometer weight should be around 2 1bs. Finally , the view port is located near other cabling and a hand turn wheel mechanism . In order to avoid rewiring the cabling and for this hand turn wheel mechanism to work with full functionality the pyrometer must be small in diameter and length with minimal accessories. The pyrometer should be close to 2.66" in diameter and 8.66" in length with no other necessary viewing stations.</p>

This is for an initial contract to provide full support at Red River Army Depot (RRAD). This contract will be a Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Type Contract not to exceed 5 years. The awardee will function as a Prime Services Integrator (PSI ) for three separately described but integrated services required to effectively and efficiently support the M-ATV industrial production programs: 1) Repair parts, components and kits support to accomplish the required repairs and upgrades; 2) Technical support to apply best manufacturing and repair practices to any Full or Tailored Implementation Sites, currently RRAD which is a full implementation site, and 3) Operation of a dual supply system for replenishing (i.e. "pushing") the required parts using proven just-in-time supply practices. <br />Provide functional support services as well as parts support for any M-ATV part, for any M-ATV variant, both current and future. The initial population of items to be priced is approximately 1500 items in support of the Army industrial based production programs at RRAD. Additional parts may be added as needed. The schedule of supplies for these items will be provided as an attachment to the solicitation.
<p>Support includes:<br />(1) Supply of proprietary and non-proprietary items</p>
<p>(2) Management of inventory</p>
<p>(3) Forecasting customer requirements and "pushing" supplies to the production line</p>
<p>(4) System engineering and technical support</p>
<p>(5) Synchronize supply distribution to meet depot and operational requirements</p>
<p>(6) Rapid response manufacturing for priority requirements</p>
<p>(7) Kitting of identified items as required</p>

<p>The contractor will store and maintain title to contractor owned inventory until the point of consumption by the customer. The stock will be held at either Government locations or Contractor warehouses near depot production sites, currently at RRAD and LEAD. As the contractor will maintain ownership of the stock until consumption, the contractor will be responsible for maintaining a discrete level of safety stock suitable to prevent stock outs. The contractor will have visibility of stock attrition to effectively plan and ramp up and forecast the requirements. The contractor will also store, manage, and forecast inventory for Government sourced parts, with the Government retaining title to the inventory until point of consumption.</p>

<DESC><strong>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.</strong> This is a Sources Sought Notice for a commercial acquisition.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Notice or reimburse the costs incurred by potential offerors in providing the information requested herein.  In preparation for an upcoming procurement, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Geodetic Survey (NGS) and Eastern Region Acquisition Division are conducting market research to determine potential sources to acquire services to construct, operate and repair Continuously Operating Reference Station (CORS) that are owned and operated by NGS.<br /><br />
<p>The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541990.  The small business standard for this NAICS code is $14.0 million.  This is not a request for technical or cost proposals.   All types of business concerns, both large and small, are encouraged to submit a brief, typed Capability Statement in response to this sources sought announcement  demonstrating their capability to construct and maintain CORS installations services, corporate experience providing same or similar services,  references, and your business size using the above size standard.</p>
<p><strong>Overview of Potential Requirement:</strong></p>
<p>A COR consists of a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) antenna that is directly coupled to the ground via monument and this antenna is connected via cable to a  receiver that collects the observed signals.  The receiver in turn is connected to a power source and telecommunications device.</p>
<p>NGS currently owns and operates 43 CORS.  These stations are located within the United States and its territories, plus one station in Brazil and one in Bermuda.  NGS anticipates the need to expand this network by between 2 - 5 stations a year adding up to a total of about 20 new CORS over a five year period.  The bulk of the new sites will be located in the United States and its territories.  Less than 5 may be located in neighboring countries around North and Central America.</p>
<p><strong>Repair of Existing Stations:</strong></p>
<p>For existing NGS CORS sites, the contractor will repair/upgrade equipment once informed by NGS. Quality control of the data from the sites will remain an NGS responsibility along with retrieving, processing, distributing, and archiving the GNSS data from the receivers. The contractor will repair the station to return it to a normal operating status, namely: Antenna, receiver, antenna cable, power supply (primary/alternate), grounding equipment and associated telecommunications equipment are in good working order and that the quality of the data obtained by NGS is satisfactory. If an upgrade is needed the contractor will test equipment before it is sent out. The contractor will be expected to provide 0900h-1700h Eastern Time support with resolution of most problems within 24hrs of regular business hours Monday-Friday,</p>

<SOLNBR>N0018914TG117
<CONTACT>Jimmy Toala
Jimmy.Toala@navy.mil
<DESC>The Fleet Logistics Center Norfolk Contracting Department, Groton Office requests responses from qualified sources to develop and execute all activities and procedures necessary to conduct a sizing correlation study to gather data on United States Navy (USN) male and female personnel to determine if the U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps Anthropometric Survey II (ANSUR II) anthropometric data correlates to the current Navy population, in accordance with the Performance Work Statement (PWS). This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE for commercial services prepared in accordance with the information in FAR Subpart 12, using Simplified Acquisition Procedures for commercial items found at FAR Subpart 13.5  (Test Program for Certain Commercial Items) as supplemented with the additional information included in this notice.
 This synopsis shall be posted on both the FEDBIZOPPS and NECO (https://www.neco.navy.mil/). The Request for Quote (RFQ) number is N00189-14-T-G117. The NAICS code is 541990  All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services, and the small business standard is $14 Million. The Fleet Logistics Center Norfolk, Contracting Department, Groton, CT Branch is seeking information as to determine whether or not there are small businesses that can support this effort. Based on the information received, a determination will be made as to whether or not the procurement will be issued as a small business set-aside and whether or not will be issued on a competitive basis. In addition, the purpose of this effort is to determine if it is appropriate to use the Army data to update the USN uniforms, protective clothing and equipment sizing systems.
 References to Government contained within the PWS refer to Navy Clothing and Textile Research Facility (NCTRF), Government Furnished Property (GFP), Government Furnished Information (GFI), Government Furnished Materials (GFM), and Government Furnished Equipment (GFE). The USN female population was last surveyed in 1988 and the USN male population in 1997.  Since then the body dimensions/proportions of the U.S. population have significantly changed thereby adversely impacting the fit of the current USN uniforms (dress and utility), protective clothing and equipment.  As a result, the current sizing systems for the USN male and female communities do not meet the needs of the 21st century Sailor, leading to dissatisfaction with the fit of the Navy clothing, as well as the potential safety concerns related to the lack of interoperability of corresponding components and accessories.
  These inadequacies in the patterns have forced us to increase the amount of sizes available, with some items ranging from 108 to 195 sizes.  While the Navy has not collected recent body dimension data on their personnel, in 2010 the U.S. Army conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the body sizes of their population and published the results in the U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps Anthropometric Survey II (ANSURII) report.  The ANSURII survey collected both manual and 3D body dimensions.  Anthropometric dimensions are used to effectively design to and accurately fit a designated population.  The proposed program shall conduct a study that would include a systematic collection of noninvasive dimensions utilizing standardized and scientific quantitative techniques.
  A comparative analysis will be performed between the dimensional/body size variables collected on Navy personnel and the ANSURII data, utilizing validated statistical matching procedures.  The proposed approach would determine if a direct correlation between the demographics of the USN and U.S. Army populations exists.  If there is a positive correlation, the ANSURII database (Army sizing data) would be appropriate for the USN to utilize in lieu of conducting a full scale, costly USN anthropometric survey.  This study would complement and extend the research from the ANSUR II survey.  The USN will make every effort to utilize and leverage data collected in the Army and Marine Corps evaluations to gain efficiencies in data collection and analysis.
  The applicable documents for this requirement include, but is not limited to: the U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps Anthropometric Survey II (ANSURII) Test methods and data; 2010 Anthropometric Survey of U.S. Marine Corps Personnel (Methods and Summary Statistics); and U.S. Navy Demographics & Sampling Strategy.   
The purpose of the correlation study is to develop and execute all activities and procedures necessary to:  1) conduct a sizing correlation study of representative USN sailors; 2) summarize the anthropometric data in a structured database; 3) perform statistical matching on the Navy data compared to the ANSUR II data; and 4) prepare a final report.  The study shall result in a comprehensive anthropometric database that represents the current USN population and can be used to support design, sizing, and tariffing of clothing and equipment.
  All data collected shall parallel data collection procedures conducted by U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps (ANSUR II) to ensure validity of subsequent correlations for use in future joint service programs.  The ANSUR II data must be evaluated and utilized to the maximum extent possible to streamline the data collection and analysis processes where possible. The study shall be conducted by NCTRF - with assistance from the contractor - and will include a systematic collection of noninvasive dimensions utilizing standardized scientific quantitative techniques.  A comparative analysis shall be performed between the dimensional/body size variables collected on Navy personnel and the ANSURII data utilizing validated statistical matching procedures.The proposed approach will determine if a direct correlation between the demographics of the USN and U.S.
 Army populations exists. If so, the ANSURII database (Army sizing data) would be appropriate for the USN to utilize. This study would complement and extend the research from the ANSUR II survey and significantly reduce Navys costs associated with conducting a comprehensive anthropometric study.  The study shall be conducted by appropriately trained and experienced personnel, such as anthropologists.  Personnel should have a minimum of 3 years experience in the design and execution of military anthropometric surveys and a minimum of 3 years experience in the analysis of anthropometric survey data to characterize the current population of the USN. Following data collection, the data shall be analyzed by the experienced professionals who will add lessons learned and validity to the USN study.
 Measurement collection technique must follow that of the ANSUR II evaluation in order to maintain validity of Navys data and allow for adequate statistical matching with other services.   During data collection or at any other time where contractor personnel are interfacing with subjects or military personnel, the contractor shall, at all times, clearly indicate through clothing or other markings that they are contractor personnel.  Appropriate business attire shall be worn by contractor personnel.  This effort is unclassified; however, because data collection will take place on military installations and contractor personnel will directly access US troops and have access to data on them, no foreign nationals may be assigned to this project.
 All contractor support personnel must be properly screened to prevent security issues at the data collection areas. The contractor shall furnish all necessary services, personnel, hardware, facilities, information and supplies (as specified in the contract) required for the study.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is issuing this Sources Sought Announcement for a construction project for Repairs to the Menemsha Creek Jetties in Chilmark, Martha's Vineyard, MA, to determine interest, availability and capability of HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned and Small Business concerns.  Work is expected to begin in October 2014 and all work, including site restoration, must be completed by May 31, 2015.  The estimated construction cost is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. <br>  <br> Menemsha Creek Federal Navigation Project is located on the northwestern end of Martha's Vineyard, MA about 12 miles southwest of Falmouth, Massachusetts.  The proposed work involves repairing those sections of the east and west jetties that were damaged by Hurricane Sandy in late October 2012 and will involve mobilizing heavy construction equipment, armor stone and other project materials to Menemsha by water. <br>   <br> The repair work will involve reconstructing both the east and west jetty to pre-storm conditions including side slopes and crest height.   The quantity of stone to be placed is currently estimated at approximately 1,000 tons, split between the two jetties.  A small amount of displaced stone is expected to be recovered from the site adjacent to the jetties, but the majority of stone needed for the repairs will need to be brought to the construction site from offsite (mainland) sources as there is no known quarry on island. New stone needed to repair the structures is expected to range in size from 2 - 4 tons.   Significant portions of both jetties will require  quote mark dismantling quote mark  prior to rebuilding with new stone so that pre-storm elevations and side slopes can be matched and the armor stone can be properly aligned and interlocked.  It is expected that some of the areas of repair will need to be worked on from marine plant as equipment located on land cannot safely reach portions of the structure. <br>  <br> Interested firms should submit a capabilities package to include the following:  business classification (i.e. small business) as well as demonstrating qualifications and experience with performing at least 3 projects in the last 5 years involving construction/repair of similar massive stone structures, such as seawalls, rubble mound breakwaters, and jetties, from marine plant.  Responses should include experience of Foreman and Crane Operators working on massive stone structures from marine plant.  Please indicate the team subcontractor(s), including their prior experience and qualifications, which will be used to support the offeror's effort.  Responses are limited to twenty (20) pages and proof of bonding capability is required.  Responses are due no later than 4:00PM on June 9, 2014.  Responses should be addressed to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District, 696 Virginia Road, Concord, MA 01742-2751, ATTN:  Raushanah Muhammad or by email to raushanah.m.muhammad@usace.army.mil.  Interested firms shall provide the above documentation in one original form and one copy. The Government will not pay for any material provided in response to this market survey nor return the data provided.  This is not a request to be placed on a solicitation mailing list nor is it a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a solicitation.  The results of this survey will be considered to be in effect for a period of one year from the date of this notice.   <br>

<CONTACT>Amy Lacy, Email Amy.Lacy@ic.fbi.gov
<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to negotiate a one-time, sole source, fixed price task order under an existing FBI contract with Gulfstream Aerospace; 500 Gulfstream Road, Savannah, GA 31408. The purpose of this task order is for the installation of communications platform upgrades for the FBI's Gulfstream GV aircraft. While the aircraft is already located at Gulfstream for necessary avionics upgrades, the FBI is requesting the installation of the AirCell ATG 5000. This will streamline the upgrade process and allow for less downtime for the aircraft. AirCell is the manufacturer of the system, but the system will be installed by Gulfstream personnel. Gulfstream personnel are familiar with AirCell technology and are fully capable to install the system.
<p><br />Based on Market Research, and Government experts in the field, it has been determined that only Gulfstream Aerospace may facilitate these upgrades due to approved GV proprietary platforms, warranty certifications and FAA air worthiness flight certifications. <br /><br />Additionally, Gulfstream is the only facility identified by the FBI with all of the following technical capabilities:</p>
<p>A secure installation facility<br />Heavy lift overhead crane capability internal to facility<br />Ready inventory of essential components<br />Standardized training of personnel with service and installation procedures</p>
<p>The FBI aircraft will be maintained in a secure environment.</p>
<p>The FBI intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FRA 6.302-1. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement to the attention of Amy Lacy, email address: Amy.Lacy@ic.fbi.gov by Thursday, May 22,2014 (3:00 pm Eastern). Emailed responses will only be considered. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is at the discretion of the Government.</p>

<DESC>Military Sealift Command- Washington, DC (MSC-DC) intends to issue a Firm-Fixed-Price Contract to a single source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), on or about 01 June 2014 to The Glosten Associates (Glosten). The period of performance will include approximately six (6) months of services. The purpose of this contract is to procure specialized engineering support to conduct Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and develop work items, itemized estimated costs and installation drawings for the modifications required to correct the existing directional thruster intake casing cracks onboard USNS Howard O. Lorenzen. Glosten is the only contractor that can reasonably satisfy the necessary requirement due to its specific and unique experience related to the thruster intake casing cracks on USNS Howard O. Lorenzen. Glosten was closely involved with the initial design of the USNS Howard O. Lorenzen directional thruster tunnels as a subcontractor to the Government Contractor. In the performance of the design effort, Glosten developed Finite Element Models (FEM) of the area experiencing cracking as well as drawings and other relevant engineering analyses that will be required to perform this task. Awarding this effort to any company other than Glosten would result in unacceptable delays and substantial duplication of cost.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to issue a Limited Sources award under Federal Supply Schedule 70 to Hughes Network Systems to resume the installation and connectivity services at 128 sites for EPA?s RadNet Fixed Monitor High Speed Satellite Systems.  The services shall include an equipment upgrade to (4G) technology with a two way satellite internet access service by the installation of Satellite Modems, Satellite Dishes and De-icing Equipment at 126 specified sites throughout CONUS, Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico. The performance elements of the  Statement of Work addresses the contractor providing IP Services for Internet connections with upload speeds of 200 kbps and download speeds of 1Mbps, Unique and permanent Static IP addresses for each system and monthly service connectivity plans after each complete installation. The period of performance will be, one twelve month base (annual) period with three twelve month (annual) option periods ther eafter.  Hughes Network Systems initially performed these services under EPA Task Order EP-G12D-00328 which was competed in 2012 as a GSA Full and Open requirement and awarded as a Fixed Rate, Fixed Price Task Order. The period of performance was initially for a twelve month base (annual) period with four subsequent option periods.  Since the original Schedule Contract/Task Order is no longer valid as of October 2013, the Government is unable to exercise any options or continue the installation schedule against this Contract/Task Order and therefore a logical follow-on is requested. Approval is being requested by the EPA, National Air and Radiation Environmental Laboratory (NAREL)  Program to establish a new Contract/Task Order citing, FAR 8.405-6(a)(i)(C)? In the interest of economy and efficiency, the new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order not previously issued under a sole-source or limited sources procedures?. 
Any firm that believes it can provide the services as outlined above are invited to submit written justification to the assigned Contract Specialist NLT June 3, 2014.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the firm?s ability to provide the stated capability.  Information shall be sent electronically (via e-mail) to Beverly Barbour, Contract Specialist at Barbour.Beverly@epa.gov.  No telephone requests will be accepted.  Responses will be evaluated, however; a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received, EPA will proceed with the Limited Sources Contract.

<p>&bull;	Increase employee based size standards for 46 industries in North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Sector 42, Wholesale Trade<br />&bull;	Increase the employee based size standard for one industry in NAICS Sector 44-45, Retail Trade<br />&bull;	Retain the current size standards in the remaining industries in those sectors<br />&bull;	Retain the current 500-employee size standard for Federal procurement of supplies under the nonmanufacturer rule (13 CFR 121.406).</p>
<p><br />SBA reviewed all 71 industries in NAICS Sector 42 and two industries in NAICS Sector 44-45 that have employee based size standards as part of its ongoing comprehensive size standards review.  These revisions primarily affect eligibility for SBA's financial assistance programs.</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [X], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

If the lowest priced offer is not technically acceptable, the vendor does not have acceptable or neutral past performance, or both, then the Government will evaluate the second lowest priced quote for technical acceptability and acceptable or neutral past performance.  This method will continue until the lowest priced, technically acceptable quote, by a vendor with acceptable or neutral past performance, is determined. Quotes will be evaluated based on price and technical acceptability.  Quoter certifies that the product quoted meets or exceeds all minimum requirements as stated in the Request for Quotes. <BR> <BR>Quotes must be submitted per unit price and total price.

<p>SECURITY CLEARANCE:</p>
<p>A security pre-clearance must be performed for any employees referred to HIS through this contract.<br />Fingerprints must be completed and adjudicated prior to services being performed under this contract.<br />No contract award shall be made to any vendor or provider listed on the OIG Exclusion List http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov throughout the duration of the contract. It shall be the responsibility of the contractor to notify the acquisition official if there is a change in provider.<br />Performance of this contract will require routine access by employees of the Contractor or its subcontractors to facilities or systems controlled by the Indian Health Service (I.H.S.). Before starting work requiring routine access to I.H.S. facilities or systems each person must complete a FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) adjudicated by an I.H.S. employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System. Contractors shall allow five business days for I.H.S. processing of fingerprints taken electronically at an I.H.S. site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258. A list of I.H.S. sites with electronic fingerprint capability is available from the Contracting Officer. In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov. As soon as practicable prior to the performance of the work, the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer the names of all individuals to be used in performance of work for screening against the LEIE. During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.<br />The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to I.H.S. is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour or Cost Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.<br />Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the extra investigation(s).</p>
<p>ACCEPTANCE PERIOD: Your quotation must stipulate that it is predicated upon all the terms and conditions of this RFQ. In addition, it must contain a statement to the effect that it is firm for a period of at least 30 days from the date of receipt by the Government.</p>

<p>(v) This combined synopsis/solicitation is for the following commercial item(s):</p>
<p>0001: Resonant switch design/assembly.</p>
<p>(vi) Description of requirements for the items to be acquired: Vendor must design and assemble a resonant switch (concept described in Matter et. al. IEEE Trans. Med. Imag., Vol. 25, No. 1, Jan. 2006), to accelerate the ramp-up and ramp-down of 200 A of current through a 27 mH electromagnet.</p>
<p>(01) The circuit must include the design shown in the attached schematic, with capacitor bank, high-power diodes, and IGBT switches. It must be able to control 200 A of current through a 27 mH, 0.5 ohm coil, ramping up in tru(0%-90%) &lt; 20 ms and ramping down in trd(99%-0.5%) &lt; 15 ms.</p>
<p>Must Include:<br />&bull; Carefully chosen components, with robust circuit protection features such as RC-snubbers, diodes, buffers, and filters, to allow continuous unattended operation over a period of days.<br />&bull; Optically-isolated control of the switch state. Must accept both manual control from the front-panel and electrical control from 5 V TTL lines for: ramp-up, ramp-down, and capacitor discharge.<br />&bull; Front panel with state indicator LEDs, ammeter and voltmeter displays, and a buffered, optically isolated current monitor.<br />&bull; Safe shutdown features that can be triggered by internal or external interlocks. User must be able to interrupt operation at any point and dump capacitor charge. Interlocks monitoring cooling water flow, cooling water temperature, and magnet relays must be able to interrupt operation without user intervention.<br />&bull; Safe enclosure of high-voltage (~1 kV) components.<br />&bull; High-current, low stray-inductance bus bar wiring.

<p>The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-72, dated January 30, 2014.</p>
<p>This requirement is restricted as a Total Small Business Set-Aside. The associated NAICS code is 812331 Linen Supply and the small business size standard is $30.0 million.</p>
<p><br />PROJECT DESCRIPTION<br />Background: Contractor shall provide Laundry and Linen Services for the NIA Clinical Unit and the NIA Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span Study (HANDLS). The National Institute on Aging (NIA), one of the 27 Institutes and Centers of NIH, leads a broad scientific effort to understand the nature of aging and to extend the healthy, active years of life. The Intramural Research Program (IRP) of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) provides a stimulating setting for a comprehensive effort to understand aging through multidisciplinary investigator-initiated research.</p>
<p>One of the IRP's program activities includes the Clinical Research Core (CRC) part of the NIA Clinical Unit within the Office of the Scientific Director. The CRC seeks to elucidate normative values and separate normal aging findings from disease states. The CRC's goal is to prolong disease-free states with age. The CRC serves as an infrastructure to facilitate the creation and development of therapeutic targets for the treatment of age-related disease across the Intramural Research Program. The CRC performs research in various protocol studies that have direct clinical applications to aging and disease states. Participants in the various protocols may spend one or more days in the Clinical Unit participant rooms. Therefore, clean linens are required for participants' overnight stays.</p>
<p>Purpose or Objective: The contractor shall provide all resources necessary to accomplish the tasks and deliverables described in this Statement of Work (SOW). The contractor shall provide linens and laundering services for NIA Clinical Unit participants and patient rooms.</p>
<p><br />CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS:<br />Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall be required to furnish all the necessary services, qualified personnel, material, equipment, and facilities, not otherwise provided by the Government, as needed to perform the tasks as specified herein. Specifically, the contractor shall provide or perform the following:</p>
<p>1. NIA Clinical Unit participant rooms and testing rooms with a total of 16 beds will be provided with fresh, clean linens as needed. Additional linens may be provided for the NIA HANDLS research study located in Baltimore City, MD in mobile Medical Research Vehicles (MRVs).</p>
<p>2. Linens include but not limited to: flat sheets, fitted sheets, draw sheets, pillowcases, thermal blankets, bath blankets, bath towels, washcloths, and tie gowns, tie gowns 8 X, pillows, under pads, and hamper bags. On rare occasions, may require laundering of participant or research items (i.e. clothes, etc.).</p>
<p>3. Clean linens will be delivered to and soiled linens will be picked up at the NIA Clinical Unit located at 3001 S. Hanover Street, Fifth Floor, Harbor Hospital, and Baltimore, MD 21225. Incumbent is responsible for any charges incurred in the delivery/or pick-up of linens to Harbor Hospital (i.e., loading dock fees, etc.).</p>
<p>Special hazard exposure control shall be adhered to as the items to be laundered include NIA Clinical Participant linens, and are potentially biologically contaminated. Proper precautions must be taken by laundry personnel to protect themselves from exposure to potentially hazardous material. Laundry areas should have hand washing facilities readily available to workers. Laundry workers should wear appropriate personal protective equipment (e.g., gloves and protective garments) while sorting soiled items. Laundry equipment should be used and maintained according to the manufacturer's instructions to prevent microbial contamination of the system. Damp textiles should not be left in machines overnight.</p>
<p>The NIA Clinical Unit and will be responsible for gathering the soiled linens from their facilities and pooling them together to be picked up by CONTRACTOR at designated location. Items will be placed in laundry bags (as determined and provided by vendor). Contractor must provide means of picking up soiled linens at least twice per week as NIA does not have storage space to hold soiled linens (preferably Wednesday and Friday afternoons). Contractor will pick up soiled lab coats at least twice per week, except vendor observed holidays. When Contractor is closed for a holiday, Contractor will pick up soiled coats on agreed upon day in lieu of the holiday. The number of items to be laundered will vary depending upon the NIA Clinical Unit and NIA HANDLS activities. Each pick up will consist of at least 10 hamper bags. Clean and contaminated items should be transported in vehicles (e.g., trucks, vans, and carts) that allow for separation of clean and contaminated items.<br /><br />Laundering shall consist of antimicrobial actions from a combination of mechanical, thermal, and chemical factors. If hot water is used, linen should be washed with a detergent in water at least 160 degrees F for 25 minutes. If low temperature (less than 160 degrees F) laundry cycles are used, chemicals suitable for low-temperature washing at proper use concentration should be used. Chlorine bleach provides an extra margin of safety. A total available chlorine residual of 50-150 ppm should be achieved during the bleach cycle. The last action of the washing process should include the addition of a mild acid to neutralize any alkalinity in the water supply, soap, or detergent. This shift in pH also may inactivate some microorganisms.</p>
<p>Clean Laundry Return shall consist of the clean linen being handled, transported, and stored by methods that will ensure its cleanliness. Cleaned items will be returned to the NIA Clinical Unit every Tuesday and Thursday, except on federally observed holidays. When vendor is closed for a holiday, vendor will return cleaned linens on agreed upon day in lieu of the holiday.</p>
<p>GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITIES<br />NIA will grant the incumbent access to the Clinical Unit located on the 5th floor of Harbor Hospital when linens are to be delivered or picked up. NIA will be responsible for all damage to or loss of items belonging to the vendor used in performance of this contract when those items are not in sole possession of the vendor. Upon request, NIA will return all items belonging to the vendor.</p>

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010) (a) Doug Smith is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The COR may be changed at any time by the Government without prior notice to the contractor by a unilateral modification to the contract. The COR is located at:

As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.

For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict.

The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.

<p>10.	AREA OF CONSIDERATION: 	U.S. Citizens and Third Country Nationals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>11.	INTRODUCTION &amp; BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID/Liberia is planning a new set of energy sector support activities under the United States Government's (USG) Power Africa Initiative (PAI). Power Africa is a USG five-year initiative supporting economic growth and development by increasing the supply of, and access to, reliable, affordable, and, when possible, lower carbon power in Sub-Saharan Africa and to ensure responsible, transparent, and effective management of energy resources in that region. Power Africa will initially focus on Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Ghana, Liberia and Nigeria - a group that includes countries with among the lowest access by households to electricity and countries with an immediate need for effective energy resource management due to recent oil and gas discoveries.</p>
<p>Under PAI, the Government of Liberia (GoL) and the USG have agreed on a plan to address the constraint to economic growth caused by the underperforming Liberia power sector. This strategy covers a range of activities in the Liberia power sector, including</p>
<p>1.	Improving energy sector governance by finalizing and adopting an Energy Law, and creating an independent Energy Regulatory Board that will be empowered to establish an energy policy and an efficient regulatory framework, needed to define the market rules, and attract private investment, including a clear and transparent regime for Renewal Energy Feed-in-Tariffs (REFITS); <br />2.	Organizing new and effective energy institutions by creating an effective Energy Secretariat, designed to function as the Power Africa "Delivery Unit", and empowered to develop national energy strategic plans, coordinate the efforts of public and private sector Power Africa partners, effectively manage the large scale reconstruction and expansion of Liberia's power system, and support high priority transactions especially in the area of creation of mini off-grid systems; and <br />3.	Reorganizing the operation of the energy market by creating commercially viable energy companies in generation, transmission and distribution, and enabling a favorable business environment for private investments to expand the provision of reliable and affordable electricity services, and enhance the participation of Liberia in international energy trade exchanges through the West Africa Regional Power Market.</p>
<p>As a member of the Power Africa interagency team in Monrovia, the Liberia Energy Advocate will perform a senior leadership role in managing the implementation of the USAID/Liberia Power Africa Initiative and in providing technical assistance and policy support to the GoL counterparts, including the Ministry of Lands, Mines and Energy (MLME), the Liberia Electricity Corporation (LEC), and the Rural Renewable Energy Agency (RREA). The Energy Advocate must be highly motivated and experienced in managing energy programs, especially power sector reform, within a complex political environment involving multiple stakeholders. Ideal candidates will have strong technical understanding of the sector, strong leadership and communications skills, and understanding of and preferably experience with USAID processes and procedures. The Energy Advocate is expected to be the principal liaison with the GoL and sector partners and provide guidance and advice to USAID, the Department of State, and other USG stakeholders such as the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), Department of Energy (DOE), and the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) as part of coordinating the USG's interagency efforts and assistance to Liberia.</p>
<p>12.	BASIC FUNCTIONS OF THE POSITION</p>
<p>The Energy Advocate will report to the Economic Growth Office Director at USAID/Liberia on administrative and management issues; and as a senior-level advisor and technical expert, he/she will exercise significant independent judgment on matters of policy and technical direction and will make decisions to ensure successful program implementation.  Moreover, he/she may be required to provide policy analysis and options on energy issues as requested by senior Mission management and other US Government officials through Mission management.  The Energy Advocate will also represent USAID, as requested and appropriate, at meetings with senior Liberian officials and technical counterparts, donors, non-governmental organizations, and implementing partners.</p>
<p>The Energy Advocate must be able to rapidly assimilate, analyze and respond to rapidly changing circumstances and help guide Power Africa process to achieve optimal results.  He/she must be proactive and innovative in bringing state-of-the-art technical practices to Liberia's country specific development in the energy context.  Cross-cultural communications, cultural sensitivities, and outstanding communication and interpersonal skills are essential for success.</p>
<p>13.	SPECIFIC COMPONENTS OF WORK</p>
<p>1.	Leading and managing the cooperation with GoL to support implementation of the Power Africa Initiative activities, monitoring and evaluating implementation progress and budgets, performing site visits, addressing issues/problems as they arise, and providing feedback and progress reports to interagency team and senior USAID staff. <br />2.	Providing professional advice to the GoL on energy sector reform, including appropriate models for private sector participation, approaches to improving utility management and operations, and development of an enabling legal and regulatory framework. <br />3.	Assisting GoL in the development of Liberian regulatory institutions, as needed, and help enable them to effectively carry out their mandate. <br />4.	Supporting an ongoing dialogue between GoL authorities, USG stakeholders, donors and partners to reach consensus on energy related activities and transactions; developing, tracking and monitoring milestones; and doing the necessary preparation of reports pertinent to performance monitoring and evaluation.<br />5.	Working closely with the interagency team members in the course of advancing the five-year work plan under Project Appraisal Document for the enabling environment of private sector transactions. <br />6.	Managing related outreach efforts with USAID's Development Outreach Coordinator and the State Department's Public Affairs Officer that may include public events, press releases, and close coordination with other USG partners.  <br />7.	Serving as COR/AOR for grants and contracts and assist with the implementation of the overall Power Africa portfolio; <br />8.	Monitoring and evaluating new and on-going programs; prepare performance reports, briefing papers, concept papers, and other periodic documentation for the Mission, USAID/Washington, the State Department, and the US Congress; <br />9.	Submitting drafts and technical documentation (i.e., RFAs, RFPs, SOWs) needed to develop energy projects and activities, obligate funds, and award grants and contracts; and, <br />10.	Serving as a member on various Technical Evaluation Committees (TECs), including those for proposal review and the hiring of personnel.</p>
<p>14.	POSITION ELEMENTS</p>
<p>A.	Supervisory Controls:  The Energy Advocate will receive supervision, policy direction, and guidance from the USAID/Liberia Economic Growth Office Director.  Performance is evaluated annually based on accomplishments. While this position reports to the Economic Growth Office Director, it is a position that works with considerable administrative discretion and the successful candidate must be sufficiently experienced to understand the needs of the Mission.</p>
<p>B.	Supervision Exercised:  The Energy Advocate will not have any direct staff supervision role.</p>
<p>C.	Exercise of Judgment:  He/she must also be capable of using judgment and technical expertise and ingenuity in order to continually assess, interpret, apply and integrate energy as a priority within other sectorial plans and priorities (e.g., health, agriculture, HIV/AIDS and water and sanitation).  He/she must have the technical mastery of energy programming, policy and research issues to be able to serve as the lead senior energy representative for USAID Liberia in high-level stakeholder policy and technical meetings.</p>
<p>D.	Available Guidelines: General guidance can be found in the Country Development Coordination Strategy, Mission program reporting documents, the PAI plan and implementation letter and other USAID/Liberia documents.  Given the PAI country-specific approach to Liberia, clear guidelines for performing the work of the Energy Advocate position do not exist.  The incumbent in this position will be required to be extremely resourceful, technically strong and use their own judgment and ingenuity in a significant way in order to continually assess, interpret, apply and integrate energy and Power Africa approach as a priority into other sectorial plans and priorities, including health, agriculture, economic growth, HIV/AIDS and water and sanitation.</p>
<p>E.	Nature, Level, and Purpose of Contacts:  The position requires considerable influencing skills to negotiate and persuade, but also justify, defend, negotiate, and settle matters among decision makers. The incumbent have contacts with individuals and groups from the Government of Liberia, development partners and private sector in unstructured settings.  He/she would represent USAID in meetings with senior national level government officials as well as senior-level regional and district officials and senior level executives from private sector companies working in the energy sector.</p>
<p>F. 	Authority to Make Commitments: The Energy Advocate will exercise the authority given to all USAID activity managers and CORs/AORs within their delegated authority, and may make administrative arrangements consistent with ADS guidance and Mission policy.  He /she will take action and define priorities based on available guidelines and professional judgment.  Guidance is sought when needed, and the supervisor informed of activity and project status.  The incumbent may negotiate ad referendum for the supervisor, but is not authorized to commit new US Government funds.</p>

<p>&bull;	Experience: Minimum of 10 years of experience in the power sector with a focus on such issues as public policy, sector reform, private sector investment (Independent Power Producers; Public-Private Partnerships in generation, transmission, and distribution; and Privatization), utility management and performance improvement (e.g. Aggregate Loss Reduction; Technological Transformation; and Change Management), infrastructure rehabilitation and expansion, renewable energy technologies, analysis of electricity rates, and off-grid electrification as well as a demonstrable understanding of the current status of the energy sector in Liberia. Experience in working in countries with similar conditions to Liberia is desirable.</p>
<p>&bull;	Skills &amp; Abilities: A solid understanding of policies, strategies, technology, and social components related to energy sector reform, utility management, rehabilitation and expansion of electricity infrastructure, and off-grid electrification. Experience in the restructuring, recapitalization, and privatization of state-owned utilities would be an asset. Strong analytical and communication skills and problem-solving ability are a requirement. Demonstrated project management skills to effectively lead and manage multi-disciplinary teams in the design and execution of programs and projects.

<p>ADDENDUM to 52.212-1, Instructions - Commercial Items (JAN 1999) is applicable to this procurement. <br />The following are additional instructions to Offerors:</p>
<p>The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. <br />The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <br />Factor 1: Technical capability<br />All quoters shall provide a technical proposal to include how the offeror will perform the contract in accordance with the Performance Work Statement (PWS), which shall include all certifications and stated requirements. The Technical Proposal shall be as specific and complete as to clearly demonstrate to the Government that the offeror has a thorough comprehension of and capabilities to perform all aspects of the solicitation requirements. Statements that the quoter understands the requirement and can or will comply with the requirements will be considered in adequate.<br />Quoters whose technical submittal are rated "Unacceptable" will be rejected and removed from further competition.</p>
<p>Factor 2: Past Performance</p>
<p>The quoter shall demonstrate relevant past performance or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant past performance. Relevant past performance is performance under contracts or efforts within the past three years prior to the solicitation closing date that is the same as or similar to, the scope and magnitude of the work described by this solicitation.</p>
<p>To demonstrate its past performance, the quoter shall identify up to two (2) of its most relevant contracts or efforts within the past three (3) years, and provide any other information the quoter considers relevant to the requirements of the solicitation. Quoters should provide a detailed explanation demonstrating the relevance of the contracts or efforts to the requirements of the solicitation. If subcontractor past performance is provided as part of the two (2) of its most relevant contracts or efforts, the subcontractor past performance will be given weight relative to the scope and magnitude of the aspects of the work under the solicitation that the subcontractor is proposed to perform. Therefore, the quoter's past performance submittal shall detail clearly the aspects of the work in the solicitation that the subcontractor is proposed to perform.<br />The quoter should complete a "Past Performance Information Form" for each reference submitted. The form is Attachment 1 to the combined synopsis/solicitation. The Government reserves the right to consider past performance report forms received after the due date of the solicitation and to contact references for verification or additional information.</p>
<p>Factor 3: Price<br />Procedures in FAR 13.106 are applicable to this procurement. The quoter shall provide sufficiently detailed information as to enable the Contracting Officer to determine the reasonableness of the proposed price. Prices for all line items in the schedule above shall be provided. Price quotes shall be held firm for sixty (60) days.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items.<br />(a) The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate the offers. The Technical Capability will be evaluated first; proposals that do not pass technical will not be evaluated further and will not be considered for award. If a proposal passes technical, it's past performance and price will be evaluated next. Past performance and price are considered equal in importance. <br />Factor 1- Technical capability - The Government will evaluate the quoters technical submission to determine compliance with the Performance Work Statement. The technical submissions will be rated as either "Acceptable" or "Unacceptable". Acceptable is defined as meeting the government's requirements and Unacceptable is defined as not meet the government's requirement's. If a quote's technical submission is determined to be Unacceptable it will no longer be evaluated or considered for award.<br />Factor 2 -Past Performance - Past performance will be evaluated based on relevancy and confidence.</p>
<p>For the Past Performance factor, the rating tables identified below, entitled "Past Performance Relevancy Ratings" and "Past Performance Confidence Assessment Ratings" will be used for the assignment of ratings for relevancy and confidence assessment. Relevancy includes similarity in scope and magnitude. Quoter's past performance information will be evaluated to determine the quality and usefulness as it applies to performance confidence assessment.<br />Past Performance Relevancy Ratings<br />Rating Description<br />Very Relevant Present/past performance effort involved essentially the same scope and magnitude of effort this solicitation requires. <br />Relevant Present/past performance effort involved similar scope and magnitude of effort this solicitation requires.<br />Somewhat Relevant Present/past performance effort involved some of the scope and magnitude of effort this solicitation requires.<br />Not Relevant Present/past performance effort involved little or none of the scope and magnitude of effort this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Past Performance Confidence Assessment Ratings<br />Rating Description<br />Substantial Confidence Based on the quoter's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the quoter will successfully perform the required effort.<br />Satisfactory Confidence Based on the quoter's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the quoter will successfully perform the required effort.<br />Limited Confidence Based on the quoter's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the quoter will successfully perform the required effort.<br />No Confidence Based on the quoter's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has no expectation that the quoter will be able to successfully perform the required effort.<br />Unknown Confidence (Neutral) No recent/relevant performance record is available or the quoter's performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.</p>
<p>Past Performance will be assessed as follows:<br />Evaluation will focus only on work experience already performed. Work yet-to-be performed, and work prior to the last 3 years, will not be considered. In addition, performance data will only be assessed for those references demonstrating at least 1 year of completed performance prior to the closing date of the solicitation. <br />Past Performance Relevancy Ratings - Regarding relevancy, each past performance reference under each quoter's Past Performance submission will be evaluated to determine its individual scope and magnitude relative to the instant requirement. The following definitions will apply to this evaluation:<br />&bull; Scope: Experience in the providing the same or similar items/services defined in the solicitation. <br />&bull; Magnitude: The measure of the similarity of the dollar value of actually performed work that exists between the solicitation's requirements and the quoter's contracts.</p>
<p>Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. However, the quote of a vendor with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government. In this instance, the quoter will receive a rating of "Not Relevant" in the relevancy rating factor.</p>
<p>Past Performance Confidence Assessment Ratings - The overall assigned rating for Past Performance will be the Past Performance Confidence Assessment rating. The assignment of this rating will be based on the quality of the relevant past performance and will consider the currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in contractor's performance. The quality of performance under a past performance reference that that has no relevance to the instant requirement will not be considered in the overall assessment of Past Performance Confidence. In the case of a quoter without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the quoter may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance rather the quoter will receive an "Unknown Confidence" rating. <br />In order to verify past performance information and determine the quality of the past performance submission, the Government may contact some or all of the references provided, as appropriate, and may collect information through questionnaires (i.e. the Past Performance Report Form), telephone interviews and existing data sources to include but not limited to Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting (CPARS). The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government. This past performance information will be used for the evaluation of past performance.<br />This evaluation and rating is separate and distinct from the Contracting Officer's responsibility determination. The assessment of the quoter's past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the quoter and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ. In determining the rating for the past performance evaluation sub-factor, the Government will give greater consideration to the contracts which the Government feels are most relevant to the RFQ.<br />Factor 3 - Price - Quotes will be evaluated on the basis of price reasonableness in accordance with FAR 13.106-3(a). Vendors responding to this solicitation are advised that, prior to award, the government may request vendors to submit additional information/data to support price reasonableness such as copies of paid invoices for the same or similar services, sales history for the same or similar services, price list with effective date and/or copies of catalog pages along with any applicable discounts. Failure to submit the requested information may result in disqualification of the submitted quote. <br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of a quote mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful quoter within the time for acceptance specified in the quote, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the quote's specified expiration time, the Government may accept a quote (or part of a quote), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112</p>

<p>(ix) FAR 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. Award will be made using a Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) approach; the Government will award to the lowest priced offeror that is determined technically acceptable. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>Factor 1: Technical Capability</p>
<p>Factor 2: Price</p>
<p>(1) Factor 1: Technical Capability</p>
<p>(A) Technical capability will be evaluated based on an evaluation of Technical Capability Factor; the factor will be rated as Acceptable or Unacceptable.<br /><br />Acceptable is defined as the quote clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation. <br /><br />Unacceptable is defined as the quote does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>(B) Technical Capability Factor: Offeror shall:</p>
<p>1. Provide active and current certificate of ordination.</p>
<p>2. Provide active and current certified authorization of ecclesiastical credentials approved by the Archdiocese for the Military Services (AMS), USA (www.milarch.org ). See Attachment 4 for application information. Note: If the certification process has been initiated and the credential application is awaiting AMS approval, please indicate that in your quote. In this case, an offeror's quote will not be considered technically acceptable "until active and current credentials are validated with AMS by the Government".</p>
<p>3. Read an excerpt from a typical mass. Excerpt will be provided by the Government. Contractor must demonstrate the ability to speak English and be clearly understood. This reading will be scheduled with each offeror individually after all quotes have been received. All readings will be scheduled on Thursday, 22 May 2014 from 1330-1600 MST.</p>
<p>(2) Factor 2: Price will be evaluated in order to determine if it is reasonable in accordance with FAR Parts 13.106-3 and 15.4. Offers should be sufficiently detailed to demonstrate their reasonableness.</p>
<p>(3) AWARD PROCESS: The Government will first evaluate all quotations for responsiveness and then on an acceptable or unacceptable basis to determine whether the quote meets the specifications defined in Factor 1: Technical Capability, paragraph B, 1and 2. The Government will then schedule contractors for excerpt readings and make a technical evaluation (acceptable or unacceptable basis) on Subfactor 3 after reading occurs. Quotes will then be ranked according to price. The offeror who submits the lowest price and meets or exceeds the specifications defined in Factor 1: Technical Capability, paragraph B, 1, 2, and<br />Subfactor 3 will receive the award. The award will be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offerors.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offer for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that the offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of the offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept the offer, whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

<DESC>Amendment no: 003 is for Solicitation No.: A14PS00486 is as follows:
1. To extend the closing date to Wedneday, May 21, 2014 at 9:00 a.m.
2. To Include questions from Site Visit:
A.  How extensive does the subsurface utility exploration need to be?  Are geophysical surveys required?
Answer: No geophysical surveys will be required for this site.  However, the contractor shall make a positive effort to locate the subsurface utilities by contacting the local utility provider, BIA or blue stake and plot the locations on the site plan.
B.  A survey for radon gas is requested for the buildings to be turned over. What is the desired duration for the testing, 3, 7 or continuous?
Answer: The 3-day testing duration is adequate for the four buildings proposed for transfer.
C.  Are scaled floor plans required to be developed for all buildings?
Answer: Yes.
D.  Is there a need to verify or validate dimensions on site plans, i.e. are topographic surveys required?
Answer: Yes.  Verify or validate the dimensions on site plans and conduct topographic surveys.
E.  Do we need to obtain TCLP lead samples to test the potential waste stream of the demolition debris.
Answer: Yes, to profile the waste for disposal.
F.   There is no line item for the work associated with utilities location/identification.  Where should the cost be indicated?
Answer: A line will be added to the solicitation for the utility location/identification.
G.  Please confirm there is no microbial or biological testing i.e. mold, pigeon droppings, hanta virus fo any structures including those to be reoccupied.
Answer: No microbial or biological testing is required for any building.  However, because of the possible exposure, the contactor shall include this item for purposes of worker protection as identified in the Health and Safety Plan.
H.  When the term Universal Waste is used on the list of samples, is there a specific analyte to be investigated.   
Answer: PCB levels in transformers, pesticides and lead acid battery water if found.  
I.   Sample numbers to be excessive (i.e. 10 lagoon, 50 Universal Waste) or inadequate, i.e. 50 asbestos, 64 man hours). Please review and revise.  
Answer: Agreed; The sample number for the lagoons should be changed to three (3) samples for the 2 cell  lagoons; 1 sample per cell and one at the discharge pipe.  The total number of asbestos samples will be changed to 300 each.  The contractor will provide a unit price per sample for any samples above the 3000 samples estimated.  In 1989, the AHERA interpretation was AHERA applied to school buildings occupied by students.  No facility management shops, well houses, pump houses; quarters were sampled as a result of this interpretation. Therefore, these area will need to be sampled. Universal waste was included to allow for sampling of pesticides, PCB transformers or light ballasts.  Agreed;   The number of universal waste samples will be reduced to 5 samples to profile for disposal or recycling. Lagoon Sampling:  Agreed; I am reducing number of sample to one in the center of each of  the two cells and  one at the discharge point for a total of three samples.  Man Hours:  The total man hours for the project will be changed to a total cost to conduct the work rather than in man hours.  
J.  Engineers Stamp: Is an engineers stamp required. The contract will be amended to change the requirement of an engineers stamp to read signed by an environmental professional.
Answer: No engineer stamp will be required.  The requirement will be amended to read signed by an Environmental Professional.   (The ASTM E1527-05 1.6 Opinion requires an opinion and statement of an environmental professional and ASTM E1903-11 11.5.6.4 requires the statement of an environmental professional.)
K.  Engineers Evaluation Cost Analyses:  This analyses can be certified by the Environmental Professional.  
Answer: No PE Cert is required and this item will be amended in the contract.

<DESC>Amendment No.: 0001 for Solicitation No.: A14PS00490 is as follows:
1. To extend the closing date to Wedneday, May 21, 2014 at 9:00 a.m.
2. To Include questions from Site Visit:
A.	Omissions: There were at least one building at each location which was not on the listing.  These building numbers will be added to the inventory
B.  A survey for radon gas is requested for the buildings to be turned over. What is the desired duration for the testing, 3, 7 or continuous?
Answer: The 3-day testing duration is adequate for the four buildings proposed for transfer.
C.  Are scaled floor plans required to be developed for all buildings?
Answer: Yes.
D.  Is there a need to verify or validate dimensions on site plans, i.e. are topographic surveys required?
Answer: Yes.  Verify or validate the dimensions on site plans and conduct topographic surveys.
E.  Do we need to obtain TCLP lead samples to test the potential waste stream of the demolition debris.
Answer: Yes, to profile the waste for disposal.
F.   There is no line item for the work associated with utilities location/identification.  Where should the cost be indicated?
Answer: A line will be added to the solicitation for the utility location/identification.
G.  Please confirm there is no microbial or biological testing i.e. mold, pigeon droppings, hanta virus fo any structures including those to be reoccupied.
Answer: No microbial or biological testing is required for any building.  However, because of the possible exposure, the contactor shall include this item for purposes of worker protection as identified in the Health and Safety Plan.
H.  When the term Universal Waste is used on the list of samples, is there a specific analyte to be investigated.   
Answer: PCB levels in transformers, pesticides and lead acid battery water if found.  
I.   Sample numbers to be excessive (i.e. 10 lagoon, 50 Universal Waste) or inadequate, i.e. 50 asbestos, 64 man hours). Please review and revise.  
Answer: Agreed; The sample number for the lagoons should be changed to three (3) samples for the 2 cell  lagoons; 1 sample per cell and one at the discharge pipe.  The total number of asbestos samples will be changed to 300 each.  The contractor will provide a unit price per sample for any samples above the 3000 samples estimated.  In 1989, the AHERA interpretation was AHERA applied to school buildings occupied by students.  No facility management shops, well houses, pump houses; quarters were sampled as a result of this interpretation. Therefore, these area will need to be sampled. Universal waste was included to allow for sampling of pesticides, PCB transformers or light ballasts.  Agreed;   The number of universal waste samples will be reduced to 5 samples to profile for disposal or recycling. Lagoon Sampling:  Agreed; I am reducing number of sample to one in the center of each of  the two cells and  one at the discharge point for a total of three samples.  Man Hours:  The total man hours for the project will be changed to a total cost to conduct the work rather than in man hours.  
J.  Engineers Stamp: Is an engineers stamp required. The contract will be amended to change the requirement of an engineers stamp to read signed by an environmental professional.
Answer: No engineer stamp will be required.  The requirement will be amended to read signed by an Environmental Professional.   (The ASTM E1527-05 1.6 Opinion requires an opinion and statement of an environmental professional and ASTM E1903-11 11.5.6.4 requires the statement of an environmental professional.)
K.  Engineers Evaluation Cost Analyses:  This analyses can be certified by the Environmental Professional.  
Answer: No PE Cert is required and this item will be amended in the contract.

Thoreau: L.  Is a Phase I ESA required here?  
Answer:  No. 
M..  Testing quantities appear to be excessive for the site.  
Answer: The LBP samples will be reduced to three for buildings 1-999 SQ Ft and to seven for buildings 1000 SQ FT or greater PCB samples will be reduced to 10 to allow for profiling unmarked ballasts or Transformers. Asbestos Samples will be increased to 200 samples.  A per unit cost will be required for any sampling above the allowed 200 samples and any increase will be added by an amendment.
N.  Man Hours are defined as 64.  Are we to estimate this number of hours or what we anticipate?
Answer: Man Hours:  The total man hours for the project will be changed to a total cost to conduct the work rather than in man hours.  
3. All other terms and conditions to remain the same.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [X], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [X], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM.

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only.

(End of clause) <BR> <BR>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:  Department of Homeland Security United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 FAX:  202.475.3904

Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)? (1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held?(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.(c) Special rules. <BR> <BR>The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships.

(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. (f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that [Check one]:0 It is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;0 It is a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73, but it has submitted a request for waiver pursuant to 3009.104-74, which has not been denied; or0 It is a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as continued...an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73, but it plans to submit a request for waiver pursuant to 3009.104-74.(g) A copy of the approved waiver, if a waiver has already been granted, or the waiver request, if a waiver has been applied for, shall be attached to the bid or proposal. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>This solicitation has been amended to address the following vendor questions/concerns.
VA247-14-Q-0703 - GROUNDS MAINTENANCE
VENDOR QUESTIONS CONCERNS

1. On the document attached in FedBizOpps the solicitation is set aside for small business but under FedBizOpps the requirement is set aside for Disabled Veteran Owned. Which set aside is this solicitation for?  
At this time, this action is set-aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business ONLY.
2. Under the scope of work, page 7 reads as if mowing is the only requirement. Do you just want mowing? Or do you want complete grounds maintenance to include mowing, edging, weed trimming, spraying for weeds and hedge trimming?
Mowing Only
3. Are you requiring weekly service all year or do you just need to be sure that the improved areas are kept at a level of 3-5 inches all year round? 
Weekly mowing of improved areas through 9/30/2014 to maintain a height of 3-5 inches.
4. On the price sheet, I noticed that the unit is JOB with QTY only at 1. Should the unit be Month with QTY 12 or maybe Unit JOB with QTY 12? 
Weekly mowing of improved areas through 9/30/2014 to maintain a height of 3-5 inches. This will include the required weekly cutting of improved grounds from June 1, 2014 through September 30, 2014. The vendor's price should also reflect the semi improved cutting 2x a month also.

<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">The purpose of this amendment is to post final questions and answers from interested parties. The proposal due date remains Wednesday 21-May-2014 at 4:30pm EST.</strong></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Question 12:<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></strong>It has been established there is no Program Manager built-in to the labor categories. Is it acceptable to the Government for the contractor to appoint a task lead for deliverable submission?</p>
<p>If yes, is it acceptable to the Government for this task lead to act as the local contractor representative on all matters, or does the Government expect/prefer the contractor to provide a Program Manager (non-billable) for this effort?</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="COLOR: #0070c0">Answer 12:<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></strong><span style="COLOR: #0070c0">Appointing one of the direct positions on a task order as a task lead is acceptable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The task lead can be assigned as the local contractor representative on all matters. SOW paragraph 1.1.1 details the requirements for program management responsibilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: #0070c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Question 13:<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></strong>How are offerors to submit proposals?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="COLOR: #0070c0">Answer 13:<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></strong><span style="COLOR: #0070c0">Offerors are to submit proposals through AMRDEC SAFE in accordance with L-900 Instructions to Offerors.</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: #0070c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Question 14:<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></strong>(14 - 0) The table provided in amendment 004 is referred to as the government estimate yet this table does not reflect salary differentials for a number of positions (eg. Software Engineer II-V (all graded as GS-855-12-4), Senior Engineer I-III (all graded as GS-855-12-8), etc.) as would be provided according to FAR 52.222-42, Statement of Equivalent Rates for Federal Hires.</p>
<p>(14 - 1) Does the table provided in Amendment 004 accurately reflect the labor rates used to determine the Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE) for the work to be performed on this contract?</p>
<p>(14 - 2) If this is not an accurate estimate of the IGCE and the salaries of employees currently performing this work will the government be evaluating each bidders pricing against the IGCE and current salary estimates for reasonableness and balance? &nbsp;&nbsp;For example, would a bidder who estimates salaries for their Software Engineers II-V above the government provided minimum salary but well below the market average for the knowledge and skill differential each labor category requires and separating them by only a small margin starting at $76,446 be found both reasonable and balanced?</p>
<p>(14 - 3) Can a bidder be eliminated for being above your stated minimums in each Labor Category but estimating salaries in some Labor Categories so low they demonstrate a lack of understanding of the work to be performed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="COLOR: #0070c0">Answer 14:<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></strong><span style="COLOR: #0070c0">(14 - 0) FAR 52.222-42 does not apply to this solicitation.</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: #0070c0">(14 - 1) Amendment 004 reflects the government's estimated GS Equivalents for corresponding labor categories and associated GS Salaries. The GS Equivalents are being used as a minimum threshold for determining the realism of an offeror's compensation plan IAW FAR 52.222-46.</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: #0070c0">(14 - 2) Any proposed labor categories reflecting a salary lower than the government's estimate, as stated in the table under M-900, will be considered unrealistically low and the corresponding price volume will not be evaluated for award. Price reasonableness will be supported by adequate price competition. Balanced Pricing will be evaluated to identify if one or more contract labor rates is significantly overstated or understated and if the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the government. Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, has the lowest total evaluated price.</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: #0070c0">(14 - 3) No. A bidder will not be eliminated for having low salaries as long as they are above the stated minimum GS equivalent per labor category.</span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="COLOR: #0070c0">Offerors are cautioned that if they are awarded the contract, they must perform on all task orders issued which includes being able to hire and retain qualified personnel, offerors should establish prices they believe are realistic to fulfill contract and task order requirements.</span></strong></p>

<DESC>*Regarding the DRAFT RFP posted on 14 May 2014: The date for Industry feedback has been extended. Feedback is requested from Industry by 30 May 2014. <br>  <br> *Questions and Answers from Industry Day on 15-16 April 2014 have been posted under additional documentation.  <br>    <br>  *14 May 2014: DRAFT RFPs for both High Velocity and Low Velocity can be found attached to this announcement.  The DRAFT RFPs are intended to provide offerors with the most updated information that the Government plans to include in the final RFP. However, offerors are cautioned that this is still just a DRAFT and all information including, but not limited to, Section B (CLIN Structure), Section C (SOO), Section H Down Select Criteria, Section L Proposal Instructions, and Section M Evaluation Criteria is subject to change. Feedback is requested from Industry by 23 May 2014. Attachments have been uploaded under Additional Documents.    <br>          <br>     *12 May 2014 Updates:      <br>            <br>      Recent pyrophoric 28-day Temperature and Humidity and Long Term Storage testing discovered material performance degradation and structural integrity issues.  Due to this new information, the Government will add Environmental & Storage as an element under the Technical evaluation of the Request For Proposal for the Low Velocity and High Velocity TP-DNT program.      <br>            <br>      Clarification for EUC submittals:      <br>      If the country in which your company is exporting your bid samples from requires an End User Certificate for Solicitations W15QKN-14-R-0038 40mm LV TP DNT and W15QKN-14-R-0039 40mm HV TP DNT, the quantity requested shall be 100 for LV and 128 for HV.  The USG will also not accept additional rounds above the USG requirement (100 for LV and 128 for HV).  Any offeror who requests additional quantities will be informed that the USG immediately does not concur with a request of this nature, and the Offeror shall resubmit their EUC request with the USG requirement quantity.      <br>            <br>      ATF Information:      <br>      Any offeror requiring import of an article from a foreign nation shall follow the ATF Guidebook - Importation & Verification of Firearms, Ammunition, and Implements of War as found on the following website to ensure that the importer has the correct ATF licenses/forms applicable to the importation process and transfer of items to USG (ATF Forms 6, 2 and 5):        <br>            <br>      http://www.atf.gov/files/firearms/guides/importation-verification/download/firearms-imporation-verification-guidebook--complete.pdf      <br>             <br>      The offeror is reminded that all ATF license coordination is the responsibility of the offeror.       <br>            <br>      Any questions surrounding what ATF paperwork is required shall be directed to the ATF Industry Liaison, Desiree M. Dickinson at 304-616-4584 or Desiree.M.Dickinson@usdoj.gov.      <br>            <br>      The Term  quote mark AMMUNITION quote mark  means ammunition or cartridge cases, primers, bullets or propellant powder designed for use in any firearm.      <br>            <br>      Special attention is drawn to the following:      <br>            <br>      1) An approved import permit on ATF Form 6, Application and Permit for Importation of Firearms, Ammunition and Implements of War, is required to import these articles into the United States and allows the importation of the articles listed on the form. A permit is valid for one year from its approved date.      <br>             <br>      2)To obtain approval of submitted applications, the items to be imported must be correctly and completely identified on the ATF Form 6. In the case of new or unusual firearms, photographs and drawings of all markings should be submitted with the permit. It is strongly recommended that persons wishing to import firearms, ammunition, and defense articles first determine if the items are importable and then obtain an approved ATF Form 6 before acquiring the items abroad or attempting to bring them into the United States. Items may be conditionally imported pursuant to 18 U.S.C.   925(d) and/or 26 U.S.C.   5844.      <br>            <br>      3) It typically takes the Firearms and Explosives Imports Branch (FEIB) personnel four to six weeks to process a properly executed ATF Form 6 import permit application.      <br>      Permit Application Tracking System One tracking method employed by importers involves the use and placement of an internal control number or optional number (as assigned by the Government) generated by the importers on the permit applications they submit. ATF encourages the use of internal control numbers or optional numbers by importers. Importers who elect to use an internal control numbers or optional numbers (composed of no more than 20 alpha-numeric characters) should place these numbers at the top of their ATF Forms 6 in the space entitled For Applicant's Optional Use. Our database will allow us to capture these unique numbers as a key field, and allows us to search for a given application the unique number established by the importer.  If the items will be utilized on a Government contract or solicitation please ensure to include the Contract or Solicitation Numbers on your paperwork.      <br>            <br>            <br>            <br>      *This is an update to the EUC language published on 17 April 2014.       <br>              <br>       Any offeror requiring an End User Certificate (EUC) shall submit a request with the following information:       <br>       1. Request shall be submitted on contractor letterhead.       <br>       2. List of supplier(s) and prime contractor.        <br>       3. Description of item along with the quantity being shipped.       <br>       4. Rationale for why the EUC is being requested.       <br>       5. The number of days that the supplier's country requires a DVC       <br>              <br>       Please keep in mind that High Velocity and Low Velocity will be two separate solicitations and if the offeror plans to submit bid samples for each, then two EUC requests will need to be submitted.

Feedback is requested from Industry by 30 May 2014.  <br>    <br>  *Questions and Answers from Industry Day on 15-16 April 2014 have been posted under additional documentation.   <br>      <br>   *14 May 2014: DRAFT RFPs for both High Velocity and Low Velocity can be found attached to this announcement.  The DRAFT RFPs are intended to provide offerors with the most updated information that the Government plans to include in the final RFP. However, offerors are cautioned that this is still just a DRAFT and all information including, but not limited to, Section B (CLIN Structure), Section C (SOO), Section H Down Select Criteria, Section L Proposal Instructions, and Section M Evaluation Criteria is subject to change. Feedback is requested from Industry by 23 May 2014. Attachments have been uploaded under Additional Documents.     <br>            <br>      *12 May 2014 Updates:       <br>              <br>       Recent pyrophoric 28-day Temperature and Humidity and Long Term Storage testing discovered material performance degradation and structural integrity issues.  Due to this new information, the Government will add Environmental & Storage as an element under the Technical evaluation of the Request For Proposal for the Low Velocity and High Velocity TP-DNT program.       <br>              <br>       Clarification for EUC submittals:       <br>       If the country in which your company is exporting your bid samples from requires an End User Certificate for Solicitations W15QKN-14-R-0038 40mm LV TP DNT and W15QKN-14-R-0039 40mm HV TP DNT, the quantity requested shall be 100 for LV and 128 for HV.  The USG will also not accept additional rounds above the USG requirement (100 for LV and 128 for HV).  Any offeror who requests additional quantities will be informed that the USG immediately does not concur with a request of this nature, and the Offeror shall resubmit their EUC request with the USG requirement quantity.       <br>              <br>       ATF Information:       <br>       Any offeror requiring import of an article from a foreign nation shall follow the ATF Guidebook - Importation & Verification of Firearms, Ammunition, and Implements of War as found on the following website to ensure that the importer has the correct ATF licenses/forms applicable to the importation process and transfer of items to USG (ATF Forms 6, 2 and 5):         <br>              <br>       http://www.atf.gov/files/firearms/guides/importation-verification/download/firearms-imporation-verification-guidebook--complete.pdf       <br>               <br>       The offeror is reminded that all ATF license coordination is the responsibility of the offeror.        <br>              <br>       Any questions surrounding what ATF paperwork is required shall be directed to the ATF Industry Liaison, Desiree M. Dickinson at 304-616-4584 or Desiree.M.Dickinson@usdoj.gov.       <br>              <br>       The Term  quote mark AMMUNITION quote mark  means ammunition or cartridge cases, primers, bullets or propellant powder designed for use in any firearm.       <br>              <br>       Special attention is drawn to the following:       <br>              <br>       1) An approved import permit on ATF Form 6, Application and Permit for Importation of Firearms, Ammunition and Implements of War, is required to import these articles into the United States and allows the importation of the articles listed on the form. A permit is valid for one year from its approved date.       <br>               <br>       2)To obtain approval of submitted applications, the items to be imported must be correctly and completely identified on the ATF Form 6. In the case of new or unusual firearms, photographs and drawings of all markings should be submitted with the permit. It is strongly recommended that persons wishing to import firearms, ammunition, and defense articles first determine if the items are importable and then obtain an approved ATF Form 6 before acquiring the items abroad or attempting to bring them into the United States. Items may be conditionally imported pursuant to 18 U.S.C.   925(d) and/or 26 U.S.C.   5844.       <br>              <br>       3) It typically takes the Firearms and Explosives Imports Branch (FEIB) personnel four to six weeks to process a properly executed ATF Form 6 import permit application.       <br>       Permit Application Tracking System One tracking method employed by importers involves the use and placement of an internal control number or optional number (as assigned by the Government) generated by the importers on the permit applications they submit. ATF encourages the use of internal control numbers or optional numbers by importers. Importers who elect to use an internal control numbers or optional numbers (composed of no more than 20 alpha-numeric characters) should place these numbers at the top of their ATF Forms 6 in the space entitled For Applicant's Optional Use. Our database will allow us to capture these unique numbers as a key field, and allows us to search for a given application the unique number established by the importer.  If the items will be utilized on a Government contract or solicitation please ensure to include the Contract or Solicitation Numbers on your paperwork.       <br>              <br>              <br>              <br>       *This is an update to the EUC language published on 17 April 2014.        <br>                <br>        Any offeror requiring an End User Certificate (EUC) shall submit a request with the following information:        <br>        1.

<DESC>To submit a quote under GSA, Vendor's are required to have a contract under the GSA Schedule.  The Request for Quote (RFQ) will be posted on www.eBuy.gsa.gov on or about 16 June 2014.  All requirements will be outlined in the RFQ. <br> The U.S. Army Contracting Center-APG, Natick Contracting Division, in support of the U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development, and Engineering Center (NSRDEC), in Natick, MA, has a requirement for commercial CAD Drawing Services. The NSRDEC is responsible for the development of technical data packages used to procure its multiple commodities.  This requires maintenance of the engineering data, such as drawings.  CAD/Drawings are one of the most important components of a technical data package.  Once an item has completed development and is ready for procurement, the drawing package is placed under configuration management and any subsequent changes-corrections, Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) etc.-need to be strictly documented and recorded.  This situation results in a sporadic level of activity involving drafting and the insertion of the changes into the drawing package so that is remains up-to-date, accurate, and available for procurement and re-procurement.  This contract is intended to provide the NSRDEC and Natick Soldier Systems Center (NSSC) partner organizations, with CAD/Drawings and solid models for the generation and modification of drawing packages through individual task orders. Travel expenses will not be reimbursed under this contract. The Government is anticipating awarding a single Firm Fixed Price Five Year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract with a minimum value of $3,000.00 and a maximum value of $6,000,000.00 to be solicited as a Small Business Set-Aside under General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedules (FSS).  Contract minimum and maximum limitations may be fulfilled by a combination of Task Orders.  Funds will be obligated on individual Task Orders, and not on the basic contract.  The services are non-severable and the Government intends to conduct discussions but reserves the right to award without discussions.  The Government may award one or no contracts as a result of the Request for Quotations.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541340, and the size standard is $7.0 Million.  This is not an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or Request for Proposal and not to be taken as a commitment by the Government.   Information relating to this synopsis should be submitted via email (telephone calls will not be accepted) to Michelle Miller, Contract Specialist, at michelle.m.miller22.civ@mail.mil, no later than 16 May 2014.

The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1313.106?2?70, insert the following provision: Evaluation Utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures (Date) All solicitations using simplified acquisition procedures in FAR Part 13 must include provision 1352.213?70, Evaluation Utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures, or similar language setting out evaluation criteria.The Government will issue an order resulting from this request for quotation to the responsible offeror whose quotation results in the best value to the Government, considering both price and non-price factors. <BR> <BR>Insert provision 1352.213?71, Instructions for Submitting Quotations under the Simplified Acquisition Threshold?Non-Commercial, or similar language in all solicitations for non-commercial purchase orders under the simplified acquisition threshold.

<AWARDEE>ITT Space Systems LLC 1919 West Cook Road Fort Wayne, IN 46818-1165
<DESC>The Radiation Budget Instrument (RBI) contract is to procure a scanning radiometer capable of measuring Earths reflected solar and emitted thermal radiance in three spectral bands.  RBI will fly on the Joint Polar Satellite System 2 (JPSS-2) mission planned to be launched in November 2021 and will continue the singularly unique global climate measurements of the Earths radiation budget provided by the Clouds and the Earths Radiant Energy Systems (CERES) instruments since 1998.	The data from RBI will also provide fundamental inputs to extended range (10 day or longer) weather forecasting, and be used to develop a quantitative understanding of the links between Earths radiation budget and the properties of the atmosphere and surface that define that budget. The contract will consist of two Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs). CLIN 001 is for design, fabrication and delivery of a RBI and all associated hardware, software, and data deliverables in accordance with the requirements specified in the contract.  CLIN 002 is Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity and allows the Government to issue task orders for pre-delivery and post-delivery directed studies and consultation support and for up to two additional RBI flight units and/or associated parts and spares.

In order to ensure consistency of results and acceptance that is federal government-wide and by local public health entities, this agency&nbsp;uses the same equipment as the Department of Defense Medical Identification and Treatments Systems - Critical Reagents Program screening analysis, and therefore must use the only validated assay - namely Life Technologies Platinum Taq Polymerase.</p>

<p>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL FOR USE OF<br />OTHER TIIAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>1. Contracting Activity<br />Naval Research Laboratory (NRL)<br />4555 Overlook Ave SW<br />Washington DC 20375-5320</p>
<p>2. Description of Action Being Approved IN REPLY REFER TO. 6100 SER 3200114<br />06 MAY 2014</p>
<p>Authority to act under this Justification and Approval for use of other than full and open competition for the award of a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contract for Micro-Optic Low Light Imager (MOLLI) Night Vision Enhancement Device for the Naval Research Laboratory Chemical Dynamics and Diagnostics Branch (Chemistry Division) to Creative Microsystems Corporation (CMC), 49 Fiddlers Green, Waitsfield, Vermont 05673.</p>
<p>3. Description of Services:<br />CMC shall engineer and develop a night vision device in a light weight form factor, capable of exceeding performance characteristics of the existing night vision goggle technology (AN/PVS-31 ). The device shall be a low light amplification system with a spectral response in the visible, NearInfrared<br />(NIR) and Short-Wavelength Infrared (SWJR) (0.4 to 2.5 nm). The form factor should reduce the weight of a night vision enhancement system to less than 500 grams with an objective of 100 to 200 grams. Finally the design goals should increase the systems life span by five years and provide a pathway to a manufacturing design that could realize 75 to 90 percent reduction in high<br />volume production cost over current system. This requirement will also require CMC to design and build an imaging array that enables a binocular device capable of supporting wide fields of view. CMC will develop an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) that supports hybrid-electrooptic<br />imaging approach capable of combining scene elements from the imaging array- amplifier pair into a single high resolution image, as well as, build and integrate high-performance optics to produce a reduced form factor emissive near-to-eye display that provides the viewer with 20/20 acuity.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: 08 May 2014 through 07 May 2016</p>
<p>Estimated Dollar Value</p>
<p>Type&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FY14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FY15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Total<br />RDT&amp;E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $1.8M&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $0.9M&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $2.7M<br />Total&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $1.8M&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $0.9M&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $2.7M</p>
<p>4. Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition:<br />The statutory authority pennitting other than full and open competition is 10 USC Section 2304 (c)(1), as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)6.302-1 (a)(2)(iii), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.</p>
<p>5. Rationale Justifying Use of Cited Authority:<br />CMC holds the proprietary intellectual property for the materials and fabrication process used in the development of the required optical sensors. While related materials and fabrication processes arc not unique to optical sensors, the ability to fabricate to achieve a light weight form factor is highly specialized. A survey of commercial and academic perfonners was conducted. No other vendor was identified with current ability to fabricate an item with the required specification. In addition, analysis of costs incurred by a vendor other than CMC for development and fabrication of the new requirement requires (approximately) an additional $600K in Government dollars. CMC also has supply chain management capability and maintains key relationships to vital<br />suppliers across the multi-service complex, has engineering and program management expertise to support continuous improvement and production efforts and possesses learning curve efficiencies, which will save the Government (approximately) ten percent or $108K over a vendor that must<br />"ramp" up. The capability to develop, produce, sustain and improve night vision technology requires in-depth knowledge of the fabrication process that only the manufacturer and developer in possession of proprietary property/data can provide. Award to a vendor other than CMC would<br />result in an additional total estimated cost of $708.5K for a competitive procurement over the cost of sole-source procurement.</p>
<p>Therefore, CMC is the only qualified source that is capable of providing engineering and development of a night vision device in a light weight form factor prototype, capable of achieving or exceeding performance characteristics of the existing night vision goggle technology (AN/PVS- 31 ), at an affordable cost.</p>
<p>6. Description of Efforts Made to Solicit Offers from as Many Offerors as Possible:<br />NRL's Chemistry Division, maintains in-depth knowledge of MOLLI technology developments and industrial base. This includes insight into technologies that individual companies are focused on and their technical and production capabilities. NRL Chemistry Division representatives maintain this knowledge through routine review of industry journals and attendance at industry<br />symposia and conferences. They also periodically visit industry facilities for briefings on companies RDT&amp;E efforts. Based on its knowledge and expertise, NRL Chemistry Division has determined that no company other than CMC has the knowledge and technical capability required to provide the support required above. NRL's Chemistry Division will continue to monitor market infonnation and technical publications to determine whether any other vendor can meet future<br />needs.</p>
<p>7. Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost:<br />The Contracting Officer will analyze contractor's cost proposal lAW FAR Part 15 to determine if the anticipated cost to the Government for the supplies/services covered by this J&amp;A will be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>8. Actions to Remove Barriers to Future Competition:<br />The support of CMC is planned to last the length of the contract and enable the collection of data in the laboratory and field and identification of lessons learned. Every effort will be made to incorporate the findings and recommendations that will be based on the night-vision prototype into the competition for future acquisition of a new MOLLI design and development,<br />while still protecting proprietary information of CMC.</p>
<p>9. Description of Market Research:<br />A survey of commercial and academic performers in this area was conducted and no other vendor was found to be capable of providing current specialized night vision technology utilized in this requirement. The COR/ARO is fully cognizant of the equipment/expertise in this scientific field and has, via market survey, determined there is no other source available.</p>
<p>10. Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition:<br />None</p>
<p>11. List of Sources, if any, that Expressed Interest in the Acquisition:<br />None</p>
<p>13. Contracting Officer's Certification:<br />The Contracting Officer's signature on the Coordination and Approval Document evidences that he/she has determined this document to be both accurate and complete to the best of his/her knowledge and belief.</p>
