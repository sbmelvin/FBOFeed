<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation issued by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 2, Albuquerque, New Mexico for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation No. 201817Q038 is issued as a Request for Quotes.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-27.  The clauses and provisions referenced in this solicitation can be found in full text format at http://www.arnet.gov/far.  This solicitation is 100% Set Aside for Small Business.  The contract type will be firm fixed price.  The associated NAICS Code is 813312 and the small business size standard is $6.0 million average annual gross receipts for the past three years.  The Department of Labor Wage Determination that applies to this procurement:  2005-2361, Rev. No. 3, Dated 05/29/2007.  The full text of the above wage determination may be obtained at www.wdol.gov. SCOPE OF WORK: 1.  Executive Summary:  Rio Grande silvery minnow (minnow) historically occupied approximately 3,862 river km (2,400 mi) in New Mexico and Texas. It was found in the Rio Grande from Española, New Mexico, down through Texas to the Gulf of Mexico (Bestgen and Platania 1991). It was also found in the Pecos River, a major tributary of the Rio Grande, from Santa Rosa, New Mexico, downstream to its confluence with the Rio Grande in Texas.  Currently, the Rio Grande silvery minnow is believed to occur only in one reach of the Rio Grande in New Mexico, a 280 km (174 mi) stretch of river that runs from Cochiti Dam to the headwaters of Elephant Butte Reservoir. Its current habitat is limited to about 7 percent of its former range. The species was listed as federally endangered in 1994 (59 FR 36988 36995).	Population viability analysis (PVA) is a collection of methods for evaluating the threats faced by populations of species, their risks of extinction or decline, and their chances for recovery, based on species-specific data and models.  A population and habitat viability assessment (PHVA) process uses PVA methodologies as only a single component of a much larger interactive, participatory workshop environment explicitly designed to broaden stakeholder involvement and enhance information sharing across disparate scientific and social domains (Seal 1993; Lacy 1993/1994; Westley and Miller 2002). Through this methodology, the conservation decision-making process is improved with considerably greater local ownership of the recommendations that are developed and presented by the participants themselves.  This process is well suited for the various entities interested in the needs of the minnow and involved with the Middle Rio Grande Endangered Species Collaborative Program.  Proposed workshops for the minnow will produce a PVA and a set of draft conservation strategies for the minnow.  The product of the workshops will be a detailed action plan for potential future management of the species and selected elements of their habitat within its range.    2.  Scope of Work The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) will host three workshops.  The first workshop will be a relatively small team of biological experts (approximately 10-15 participants) to develop the PVA.  The second will be an all inclusive (up to approximately 65 participants) 3-5 day PHVA workshop and will discuss management strategies with interested stakeholders.  The contractor will facilitate the workshops and perform analyses.   Contractor will provide all needed expertise, material, equipment, labor, and transportation required to provide the service requested.  The contractor will provide the following: 1. In close collaboration with the inviting authority, all available information on the Rio Grande silvery minnow and its biology will be assembled and reviewed.  2. Workshops will be planned and conducted with experts in the field of silvery minnow biology and with interested stakeholders.  3. The first workshop will consist of meeting with experts in the field of silvery minnow biology and management in order to help develop a population dynamics simulation model using the appropriate PVA software platform. This model will be used to develop a baseline of silvery minnow population biology and extinction risk. In addition, workshop participants will develop a set of scenarios designed to investigate the wide array of uncertainties in silvery minnow biology and the set of plausible population management options available to mitigate the risk of population extinction and decline.  4. Following the close of Workshop 1, the contractor will develop a comprehensive set of PVA models deemed appropriate during the workshop discussions. The results of these analyses will be assembled in summary form, and a report will be written and distributed to all Workshop 1 participants.  5. Following review of the summary report a second workshop will be held with the same experts to discuss the results of the PVA modeling. Based on the analysis and discussions, preliminary conservation strategies may be discussed.  6. Following the close of Workshop 2, the contractor will coordinate the completion of the workshop report for distribution in draft form and, following review by workshop participants, revision as a final report document.  7. A 3-5 day workshop, known as a Population and Habitat Viability Assessment workshop or PHVA, will be planned to discuss management strategies with local working groups and interested stakeholder.   USFWS, in collaboration with relevant state authorities, will be responsible for selecting local representatives to attend this workshop. Workshop processes will provide an objective environment, expert knowledge, and a neutral facilitation process that supports sharing of available information across institutions and stakeholder groups, reaching agreement on the issues and available information, and then making useful and practical management recommendations for the taxon and habitat system.  8. A management plan will be developed from all information collected at workshops with the scientific experts and interested stakeholders. This plan will be presented to USFWS and other interested parties (as well as all workshop participants) for internal review.  Project Objectives 1)  Develop a population viability analysis for the Rio Grande silvery minnow. 2)  Conduct a population and habitat assessment for the Rio Grande silvery minnow with input from all stakeholders. 3)  Develop a draft management plan for the Rio Grande silvery minnow in the Middle Rio Grande. Deliverables 1)  A comprehensive set of PVA models deemed appropriate from PVA workshops. 2)  A summary report of PVA model analyses. 3)  A draft management plan for the Rio Grande silvery minnow in the Middle Rio Grande due before March 31, 2008. PERFORMANCE TIME: Completion Date March 31, 2008.  Workshop schedules and times will be collaborated with the contractor and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. BASIS OF AWARD: Award will be maded based on a best value analysis to include price, past performance, and quality.  Quoters should include past performance information along with their quote.  In addition, please include a short paragraph stating your approach to the scope of work and quality control.

<DESC>1.	This specification establishes the functional, performance, design, fabrication, and inspection requirements for composite spacers including spacer/cuff seals, and disc/spacer interface bushings used in the Arnold Engineering Development Center?s (AEDC) wind tunnel 16T.  A total of 211 spacer assemblies, including seals and bushings (67 Row A spacers, 71 Row B spacers, and 73 Row C spacers) and 700 fastener bolts, nuts and washers shall be supplied in accordance with parameters set forth in this specification.  The C1 Compressor provides airflow for the 16T wind tunnel.  The C1 compressor accomplishes this through standard axial flow technology.  The compressor is a large three-stage axial flow machine with a rotor blade tip-to-tip diameter of 30.2 ft.  Each stage is composed of rotating blades separated by variable pitch stator blades. Composite spacers including spacer/cuff seals, and disc/spacer interface bushings are used to fill and fair-in the compressor hub between the compressor rotor blades at the blade root section, to limit the blade tangential motion and to restrict air flow in the hub region to ensure compressor efficiency.  These spacer assemblies are integral to the operation of the rotating blades.

2.	The procurement will be accomplished by the two-step sealed bidding method.  STEP ONE consists of this Request for Technical Proposals, submission of Technical Proposals by prospective contractors, evaluation of proposals by the Government, and, if necessary, discussions of proposals with bidders.  STEP TWO will consist of the Invitation for Bids, submission of bids, evaluation of bidder?s ability to perform the proposed contract and contract award.  STEP TWO will be restricted to those contractors who submitted technical proposals in STEP ONE and were determined to be acceptable either initially or as a result of discussions.  Bids in STEP TWO must be based on the bidder?s own technical proposal.

3.	This Request for Technical Proposals consists of the following:

	(a)  Attachment 1 ? Item Specification for AEDC Tunnel 16T C-1 Composite Compressor Spacers and Associated Hardware Revision B dated 23 April 2007 (17 pages and 20 drawings).

	(b)  Attachment 2 ? Technical Proposal Preparation Instructions (2 pages).

	(c)  Attachment 3 ? Technical Proposal Evaluation Criteria (2 pages).

	(d)  Attachment 4 ? Spacer Movie

4.	Technical Proposals shall be prepared in accordance with Attachment 2, Technical Proposal Preparation Instructions.

5.	Technical Proposals will be evaluated by the Government with the assistance of Technical Advisors employed by Aerospace Testing Alliance (ATA) in accordance with Attachment 3, Technical Proposal Evaluation Criteria.

6.	The submission of multiple technical proposals will be permitted in accordance with the following provision:

Multiple Technical Proposals (Apr 1984)
In the first step of this two-step acquisition, solicited sources are encouraged to submit multiple technical proposals presenting different basic approaches. Each technical proposal submitted will be separately evaluated and the submitter will be notified as to its acceptability.
7.	Technical Proposals SHALL NOT include prices or pricing information.

8.	One original and five copies of each technical proposal shall be furnished.  Technical proposals shall be addressed to:  USAF Procurement Branch, 	Contracting Division, 		 100 Kindel Drive, Suite A332, Arnold AFB TN  37389-1332, ATTN:  Mr. Tony Clayborne.  Technical Proposals must be received in Room A332, A&E Building, AEDC, on or before 2:00 P.M. (local time) on 22 August 2007.  Technical Proposals received after that time shall be considered late and shall be governed by the following provision:

Late Submissions, Modifications, Revisions and Withdrawals of Technical Proposals under Two-Step Sealed Bidding (Nov 1999)
(a) Bidders are responsible for submitting technical proposals, and any modifications or revisions, so as to reach the Government office designated in the request for technical proposals by the time specified in the invitation for bids (IFBs). If no time is specified in the IFB, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that bids or revisions are due.
(1)  Any technical proposal under step one of two-step sealed bidding, modification, revision, or withdrawal of such proposal received at the Government office designated in the request for technical proposals after the exact time specified for receipt will not be considered unless the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late technical proposal would not unduly delay the acquisition; and?
(i) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the request for technical proposals, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of proposals; or
(ii) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government?s control prior to the time set for receipt; or
(iii) It is the only proposal received ant it is negotiated under part 15 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.
(2) 	However, a late modification of an otherwise successful proposal that makes its terms more favorable to the Government will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.
(b) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the technical proposal wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.
(c) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that technical proposals cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of technical proposals by the exact time specified in the request for technical proposals, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the request for technical proposals, the time specified for receipt of technical proposals will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the request for technical proposals on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.
(d) Technical proposals may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of technical proposals. If the request for technical proposals authorizes facsimile technical proposals, they may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of proposals, subject to the conditions specified in the provision at 52.214-31, Facsimile Bids. A technical proposal may be withdrawn in person by a bidder or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of technical proposals, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and that person signs a receipt for the technical proposal.
9.	Bidders are advised to submit technical proposals which are fully and clearly acceptable without additional information or explanation.  The Government may make a final determination as to whether a technical proposal is acceptable solely on the basis of the technical proposal as submitted and may proceed with Step Two without requesting further information from any bidder.  However, the Government may at its sole discretion, request additional information about technical proposals which it determines reasonably susceptible of being made acceptable.  The additional information must clarify or supplement the original technical proposal, but not basically change it.  The Government may discuss any technical proposal with the bidder.
10.	Each bidder submitting an unacceptable technical proposal will be so notified upon completion of the technical evaluation of his proposal and final determination of such unacceptability.

The current operating environment presents significant risk.  This includes attacks, armed hijackings, strikes, border delays, accidents, and pilferage. Shipments from/to these ports to/from the various destinations in the region amount to approximately 9,600 twenty foot equivalent units (TEU) and 8,300 forty foot equivalent units (FEU) per year.  Approximately 85% are dry containers and 15% are refrigerated (reefers).  The reefer breakout is 381 X 20 ft containers and  3,111 X 40 ft containers.  Additionally, breakbulk cargo totals approximately 20,000 Stons.  The Government requires transit times of between 7 to 12 days from acceptance at the ports to the various locations within Afghanistan.

Responses should be concise and include the following:  

1.	A rough estimate of the cost to supply this service. 
2.	Your company?s capability in terms of providing all requirements listed above and the processes to execute (i.e. disciplined, controlled convoy movements, secure truck park areas along routes, enhanced customs clearance procedures).
3.	Specific identification of any limits to company?s capabilities.  
4.	Your company?s experience in providing the services described above and its experience with an operation similar in size and scope to that described above.

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate, Lethality and Vulnerability Branch (AFRL/MNAL) is interested in receiving proposals for the Concept Weapon Simulation Software Development (CWSSD) Program with the intent of negotiating one or more contracts for the CWSSD Program. The goal of this work is to develop/prototype software that will be used to facilitate advancement of weapon concepts/employment.  The objective is to design, develop, combine and/or demonstrate engineering, engagement (one-on-one), mission (few-on-few), systems-of-systems, and campaign (many-on-many, military worth) level techniques, tools, and research methods which will enable quick and effective evaluation of advanced weapon concepts.  Research involves, but is not limited to, intercommunicative weapons, novel destruct mechanisms, non-lethal destruct mechanisms, multiple targeting, and time critical delivery.  Accomplishing the program goals/objectives may involve a variety of weapon-related aspects, e.g., sensors, aerodynamics, autopilots, navigation and guidance schemes, propulsion, warheads, fuzes, datalinks, error filters, environment (wind, fog, dust), lethality, vulnerability, and threats.  Scenario development and visualization at various levels of weapon interaction are also expected.  Interface and utilization of existing tools includes, but is not limited to, ESAMS, RADGUNS, MATLAB Simulink, FLAMES, EADSIM, CFAM, and STORM.   The contractor must demonstrate an overall understanding of the concept weapon system software development process, familiarity with software simulation codes listed above and the technical capability to perform the requirements described herein.  See further details in attachment/amendment to this solicitation.
